Nose macerated fruit, dank, light grass. Taste similar to nose, lots of fruit. Surprisingly no grass or onion.</div>, <div style=\"color:#666;\">Can (10/29/19) pour. Appearance is orange-yellow with tons of effervescent sparkle, finger-width foamy white head with decent retention and mildest lacing. Aroma is strong, sweet fruit, spicy. Taste is passionfruit, citrus bite. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, lively carbonation (biting the tongue), hint of alcohol warmth deep in the esophagus and finish as taste. Overall, strong and enjoyable aroma and flavor but not complex. Hops just out of peak freshness so may be better fresh.</div>, <div style=\"color:#666;\">16 oz. can shared by drsordr.
