8,Revolution Fistmas Ale,1.9,"Chicago, Illinois","HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.",cheap

After all, it says it has some artificial flavors in it. Pours clear pale from a pounder can.  Smell is somewhat artificial apple, like hardtack candy. Taste is as expected, somewhat rude ass artificial apple candy with a vanilla backbone. Cannot get this. It also has a warming sensation as it goes down the gullet. Can't say I'm disjointed because I didn't expect much. I had high hopes for the Blockhouse brand but I'm afraid they are just turning into another alky laced soda pop brand. This stuff is more on the line of those kindah malt beverages, has little to do with beer, thanks.

Perhaps something turned bad in this beer after it was canned. If the beer was this bad before it was canned, surely the brewer would have poured it down the drain. Alas, that chore is now left to me.

Got from a German supermarket, a four pack, coming in a very cool looking logo of a brewer and his beer, happy with his accomplishment! An unfiltered traditional cloudy beer. 

Have to say it looks absolutely fantastic on pour, a very lovely frothy white head appearing with a beer that has a gorgeous golden colour with a deep look.

A very decent head that sticks around, some good lacing, and with the deep hazy orange look, we have a great looking beer to admire.

On the nose one gets a very, very malty aroma, very clear and easy to find. An ok malty and yeasty smell, not bad at all.

On to the taste, very soft and creamy on the tongue initially, crispy and inoffensive, not much flavouring to taste and very, very smooth. Light and not really hitting the spot.

A lot of malts and some light grains, as expected, and a bit of fruit, but very light and very boring. Kind of a waste of time, with nothing really to get stuck into in terms of prominent or excitable tastes or flavours, dont think I will be buying this one again.

Light-bodied; Sharp fake lime flavous dominate at first with a lot of lactose and creamy notes with a lot of perfume, hay, grass and funky yeast flavours that show through as the old lady perfume of yesteryear, but in the mouth, which makes it that much worse. Aftertaste shows some somewhat better and lighter lime and lemon citrus notes, but the yeast and briney, salt components show stronger and leaves the palate somewhat salty and ready for the next sip, despite the perfume and funky yeast qualities. Overall, a pretty funky, pungent and odd-tasting beer that never seems to align with the style and/or what they were trying to produce, given the fact that the caster sugar, perfume and funky yeasts all hit about the same level and the citrus, brine and malt don't really show at all. Not really worth trying to find, unless you love your grandmother, her old perfume or a really funky yeast and citrus combination of a 'beer'.

Ridiculously clear and golden coloured body with an ugly, fast-dying pure white head that stays afloat for a few seconds, at most. Aroma of yes, unflattering malt and water with some light corn sugar thrown in the mix, but this is pretty bad, especially in the nose.

Aftertaste shows the pure corn syrup and funky malts throughout without much else aside from water. Overall, a pretty standard 'macro light' beer that you'd expect with funky malt compontents, a lot of bad and off-flavours that aren't so good.

The beer pours a dark amber caramel colour. Generating a small white, bubbly head. Carbonation in the glass starts aggressively, but rapidly peters out.. The head reclines to nothing within a minute. 

The aroma is malt, chestnut purée and generic nuts. Cheap chocolate, reminding me of bad quality stouts and porters. Sweet with a light underlying bitter. Usually, even a poor beer smells inviting. This one just doesn’t. 

The taste is simply nut. Some can be identified as chestnut, some almond but mostly just a generic but taste. Some malt. Just like the aroma, cheap chocolate. Sweet like the aroma. The lightest lightest hint of bitter hop.

255,Clausthaler Original (Premium),1.7,"Frankfurt, Hesse","Review: 0,5l, green bottle of Clausthaler Alkoholfrei original: < 0.5% vol.

Comes in a bottle that looks like a regular beer. Certainly fooled me, that’s why I bought the fucking thing, thinking it was normal beer. Damn!!!!

On the pour I have to say the beer looks fantastic, a great big frothy white head, with a lot of good lively carbonation resulting in a nice clear golden coloured beer on appearance.

Head maintains very well, and some good lacing left on the glass. A good looking beer, sparkling, surprisingly good for a non alcoholic brew.…………

Smells pretty good too, getting a nice malty aroma on the nose for sure, but also a rather strange aroma. Guess could put that down to the sweet grains and floral hops. Some stringent corn smells too. Overall not bad on the nose.

Get a lot in the bottle, which is always a big plus.

The taste is a bit urgh, all very sickly sweet and very bitter. First impressions not good at all. Kind of a spicy and creamy off taste to it. 

For a non alcoholic beer it is quite hoppy and bitter, which is very surprising to me. It certainly does taste like a beer, with the malts, barley and grains to the fore, which is impressive. Could definitely fool people into thinking it was a regular beer. 

But not pleasant really, or very enjoyable, a dry finish with an artificial bitter taste that isn’t going to do it for me, will pass, thank you very much………….",Drinking_77

Aroma is light with milk chocolate notes to it and a faint whiff of an odd sourish off-gassing hint. 

Fairly sweet and heavy bodied with a moderately chocolaty tasting malt forward with ghostly note of hazelnuts to it, front end feels a little cloying and over sweet but not all that bad. 

Finish is fairly bitter tasting with a green sapling leaf hop flavor to it that grows as it warms, as well as an odd, hard to define flavor that I associate with a macro brew, like the back end of something like a Molson Canadian, a lingering faintly sour vaguely  chemical tasting like a bad fake flavored cough syrup with a faint trace of ethanol that hangs out on the aftertaste and builds up to be unpleasant",WortStein17

The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.

On the palate, the dominant flavor of orange peel and grapefruit pith is bitter and harsh; I might as well have taken a bite out of an unpeeled orange and chewed it up, peel and all.  There's plenty of orange juice flavor, maybe some mango, but the harsh orange peel character is all I can think about.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and obviously, pretty astringent.  Overall, another terrible beer from Abomination.  It's not so much that this is over-hopped, although an argument could be made that it is, but rather it's just very poorly executed, so all the harsh astringency remains in the finished beer.

Arrière-bouche faible, indéterminée, beaucoup trop caramélisée.
Longueur qui n'améliore rien dans la définition.
Jambes huileuses, longues.
Levure basique.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau abv, il laisse faire les choses trannnnquille ...
Finale paresseuse.
CONCLUSION : cette brune n'était donc pas une double, c'est assez vexant !
Elle penche plutôt du côté des brown américaines, avec des saveurs qui 
dégoulinent quelque peu .. et lambinent en tous les cas  (3/2/2/2/5)",corkyrory66

Ici la base est sucrée, ce qui rend le tout sur-sucré, et en lus sans finesse, sans complexité, et sans intérêt si ce n'est de conférer des arômes de caramel, et de cola quelque peu chimique.

Malheureusement l'amertume ne permet pas d'équilibrer la sucrosité à la dégustation ce qui la rend lourde et écœurante, surtout que les arômes quelque peu chimiques ne sont pas agréables. L'alcool à 8 % ne se ressent pas du tout et ne donne aucun caractère. Corpulence et longueur sont plutôt bonnes, mais à quoi bon? J'ai déjà trop écrit et donc perdu mon temps pour ce breuvage.",jybi

Light-bodied; Strong funky corn and fake-malt notes with a lot of bread, yeast, fake sugar and stale funk noticeable throughout, with nothing enjoyable to catch and hold onto - this is purely off-putting flavours with a dash of yeast and bready qualities with some earthy and nut finishes that give it at least something else than the fake flavours. Aftertaste is dry, herbal and very funky throughout with a lot of nutty and earthy flavours, but the fake sugars and especially fake malts dominate in a bad and unsettling way.

I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).

La brasserie a pris la précaution d'appeler ceci un "" weiss mix "" ou encore 
en anglais un "" wheat beer mix "", ce qu'en français on appelle une "" mixture "" !!
Mon exemplaire était à 11 mois avant sa date.
Couleur orangé carotté, pour ne pas dire carotte orangée (ou arrangée ..).
Bulles moyennes, éparses.
Mousse blanche, en couronne à la paroi.
Arômes de pamplemousse rose, pomélo, citrus.
1ère bouche agréable, un peu pétillante, assez équilibrée.
Arrière-bouche qui nuance bien entre sucré et amérisé.
2ème bouche avec des agrumes doux, un rien de zeste.
Arrière-bouche qui reste agrumique, mais un côté pomme rouge.
Longueur qui perd assez fortement les qualités des 1ères bouches.
Jambes lisses, courtes.
Alcool inopérant dans ce genre de mixture.
Finale de jus de fruits pour écoliers.
CONCLUSION : le seul problème ici bien sûr, est que l'on n'est pas en 
présence d'une bière … mais d'un panaché .. qui est un hybride fruité
de la plus pure tendance industrielle .. Une fantaisie à la Fanta !!

990,O'Shea's Traditional Irish Stout,1.0,"Atherstone, Warwickshire","Review: 50cl brown bottle of O’Shea’s Irish Stout: 4.5% vol.

Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!

Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” 

On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. 

Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.

The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.

On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.

In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. 

Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.

Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!

It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. 
Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….",Drinking_77

1025,Graft Book of Nomad: Bon Voyage,0.6,"Newburgh, New York","When the lid was cracked, I almost barfed immediately.

If you have been to SouthEast Asia and you know the smell immediately when you enter a room (shop) that there is a cut up, WARM, durian lobe somwhere...this is that smell, somehow multiplied. Raw onions, rotting meat, funk, odd fruits and a spoiled pineapple on top of that mix - absolutely disgusting, and if I could give a negative aroma score, I absolutely would. The colour is pink, slightly violet and showing a faint off-white head that fades fast. Light-bodied; Strong fruit flavours show first with the stronger, meatier funk right behind with some durian notes, onion flavours and a dash of apples under those way more pungent notes. Aftertaste shows the funk and pungent meaty/umami notes that aren't good - just pure bad and nasty. Overall, if you can make it past the smell, the flavour is slightly better, but still insanely pungent and strong, in all the wrong ways. I absolutely love Graft ciders, but this was easily the worst drink I've had in a very long time, perhaps many years. I found it a challenge to make it through, and I did so almost as a joke, but I did NOT pour this out, that said, it was horrible to  make it through.

Can find it with 4.1% to 3.9 % in strength, depending on the region. 

Coming in a pretty cool looking logo of a Knight’s sword, in a nice blue can. 

Aroma is pretty shit, in fact it smells a bit like shit, had the aroma of a fart! Lagery smell, and very metallic on the nose. Not great!

Looks good on pour, a nice frothy white head, nice and creamy, and a golden coloured beer on show. Not bad. Head maintains well, and some good lacing apparent. 

Get a lot in the can.

Bit of an off taste found initially, not great at all……….

Overall, it is a bit tasteless, and any taste you do get is bittersweet and lacking in flavouring.

Second can, it improved a little, and was slightly easier to drink, a bit smoother and nicer on the old stomach, but still lacking any real depth to the beer. Malty and a little hoppy, but overall not a nice beer at all. Very forgetful and not worth trying again, cheap as it is and all………..",Drinking_77

It wasn't my first taste of GK IPA from the bottle, but first for many years, and it will certainly be my last. It was even worse than I remembered it. It was served in a clear plastic bottle as no glass allowed at football but I don't think that played a part, as it wasn't as if I'd particularly enjoyed the previous ones I'd had from glass bottles. It's better cask, but bottled it just was not nice at all. It's such a shame that so many good brewers get swallowed up or go bust and yet this over-hyped brand sells so well.

The looks of the beer are fine. It doesn't look too exciting. The beer has a slight pale golden yellow colour. On top some rough white foam is formed, but it ain't much and after some seconds all is gone besides a minimal drape. The beer is crystal clear.
The aroma of the beer is meh. It is simple. The malts give a grainy note, but the cheap corn flakes give it a cheap grain dust note. A bit nutty, but not that nice. The hops aren't very aromatic. There might be a zesty touch there, but not the 'lime wedge' that is promised. It is simple. Not a very entertaining drink.
The taste of the beer also ain't world class. Some sweet malts, some bitterness from the hops. The bitterness is a bit sharp. It isn't very bitter, but it doesn't feel completely harmonious. Could be better.

1282,Störtebeker Whisky-Bier,0.5,"Stralsund, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern","Whisky bier de 9 % abv, pour 20,5° plato, en format 50 cl.
Malts cara et malt à whisky. Houblon tradition.
Pour l'anecdote, mon exemplaire était nommé ""scotch ale"", un alias.
A signaler le conseil de dégustation à 16°, très bien et assez rare à relever,
mais cela n'aidera en rien le résultat final ...
Mon exemplaire était à 8 mois avant sa date.
Couleur roux orangé, à la clarté nette.
Bulles quasi nulles.
Mousse nulle, qui laisse le liquide lisse comme un whisky … mais la
comparaison s'arrête strictement là ...
Arômes de tourbé, fumée, malt grillé.
1ère bouche sur la tourbe, crottin de cheval et bouse de vache (pas de jaloux).
Arrière-bouche longue, totalement déséquilibrée sur ces nuances altières ...
2ème bouche avec un porte-à-faux complet (et queue-de-pie au cavalier)
Arrière-bouche désastreuse (il a planté toutes les barres du triple obstacle)
Longueur qui trouve seulement une petite nuance orangée pour rendre
cet ensemble moins navrant  (mais ceci ne remet pas le cavalier en selle,
sans jeu de mot, bien sûr ..)
Jambes lisses.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau, et sans action sur l'ensemble (il ramasse les 
barres du triple ..)
Finale très faible.
CONCLUSION : une scotch ale qui est une caricature du style, comme il en
existe quelques exemplaires notoirement nuls sur le continent, type adelscott.

Taste is candied watermelon, with a Woodchuck-like aftertaste that is sort of like added distillate & sugars. Malic acid tartness. Watermelon juice here, cider is dirty. Crispy, slightly thick feel. Sulfite headache.

I will begrudgingly and half drunkenly drink my mistake. But I will do this with forewarning for the rest of you. It says it tastes of stonefruit. It tastes of lies, lies and punishment for swearing. Soapfruit. 

God help you if you find redemption in this. It is uniquely awful.

This tastes of sadness and townie punishments for swearing.

Is this contaminated? Thank god I'll be in a hospital tomorrow

1447,Hi Sign Shamus,1.7,"Austin, Texas",Maybe its because i let it sit in the fridge for 6+ months? The graphics on the can look better than this beer tastes.,greedycheater
1448,Hexagon White Chocolate Buddha,1.9,"Knoxville, Tennessee","32oz crowler, clear gold, white head.  Nose is nasty, very sweet, heavy corn syrup and treacle, white chocolate, honey, just all sweet notes.  Flavor is the same, maybe worse; there's malt liquor and white chocolate, honey, treacle.  Sticky, cloying finish.  Woof.",nimbleprop
1449,Banks's Amber (prev Bitter) (Filtered) 2019 - ,1.9,"Wolverhampton, West Midlands","500ml bottle purchased very cheaply from Lidl in 2017 (or was it Aldi?).  Very bland, pasteurised bitter.  I mean, it’s not undrinkable, but it’s not really worth bothering with, even for £1 a bottle.",Beese

1452,Fremont Sky Kraken,1.5,"Seattle, Washington","Pine and resin, some citrus, barely any malt. This beer is reminiscent of others in it's category; that is low abv IPA's, the overall body of the beer is lacking in malt flavor and bitterness while the taste of hops overpowers anything else worthy of attention. Not the worst beer I've had but definitely not good by any standards.",njarmer
1453,Moerlein Bay Of Bengal,0.9,"Cincinnati, Ohio","From a Kroger can this pours a little darker than average pale and it seems to be quite thick. Big fruity rude aroma with a mild cleaning pine fluid nose. Taste is big bad-ass and bitter. BBAB! I second that with an upper gullet warming sensation. Its near the big ten; and you feel it. In the end, is it possible I detect some sensations of unthinkingly dizzy. Whew. What else can be said? One bitter straight up ass, terribly on style, IPA IPA  brew. There you have it, another ubiquitously available style, duh.",cheap
1454,Steam Brew IPA Radler,1.5,"Neckarsulm, Baden-Württemberg","Limonadiger künstlicher Beginn, der sich mit der Zeit verschlimmert. Dumpfe Bitterkeit, brotig, dass hier ein IPA im Hintergrund ist kann man nicht erkennen. Unnütz. 7/5/5/5/7/5",Koelschtrinker

Goût de vomi, acidité moyenne-faible, semblant de goyave. Carbonatation faible, corps moyen-faible. Malheureusement, impossible de passer par-dessus l'odeur et le goût de vomi.

1468,Cigar City Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Brown Ale,1.3,"Tampa, Florida","Canned, from Systembolaget.  Dark brown, small head. Aroma of well, oatmeal raisin cookie. Sweet with medium body and clean, sterile mouthfeel. Tastes like... Oatmeal raisin cookie. Low bitterness in a finish with some tin foil. Oh, the refinement. I've always dreamed of liquid raisin cookie in tin foil. And the complexity!",omhper
1469,Mountain Crest Classic Lager,0.8,"Monroe, Wisconsin",Possibly the worst beer I've ever tasted. Actually gets worse the more you drink.  Tastes like what I imagine greasy dishwater does.,hatlanjeff

Smell of nuts and sweet fruits. Taste of flowers, malt and a little soapy. Medium carbonation. Weak body.",ophone
1471,Collective Arts Collective Project: IPA Project #10,1.9,"Hamilton, Ontario","Tall can from grocery store. Smells fruity and well hopped, pours golden with ample head. A bit murky, but that could be stylistically appropriate. Thin and dry, with too little malt/sweetness to counter the hops. Found it too unpleasant to drink.",AllGrainExports40
1472,Jever Pilsener,1.9,"Jever, Lower Saxony","Clear golden with a thin head.
Strawy, hempy smell of hops. Bitter and dry, a bit too dry for my taste. High carbonation.
Not my kind of beer.",ophone

1474,Moerlein Big Hazy IPA,1.3,"Cincinnati, Ohio","From a can you get a surprisingly clear liquid (considering the name, heheh) with a big foamy pour. It has just a very slight haze but no way is this hazy. No real offensive IPA smells in this one. Taste is big bad IPA of course and possibly it has a bit of an aged feeling to it. Date code is CMB1 9198 2361, whatever that means. Yes, big bitter IPA bullshit, like any other of the thousand ubiquitous IPA out there. What else can be said? NOTHING. Oh well, so goes the tick. Not impressed.",cheap

1479,Marston's Revisionist Irish Peated Ale,1.9,"Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire","Cask at the Kings Tun (JDW), Kingston in 2015. On paper this sounded good; the reality less so (although ‘Marston’s’ was a pretty big indicator). Hazy copper with an offwhite head. Lightest of peaty aromas; more sulphurous and grainy. Boiled sweets and apples in the flavour.",Beese

1482,Abita Honey Suckle Saison,1.6,"Abita Springs, Louisiana",Yellow pour with zero head. Aroma is odd and medicinal. Has a weird flavor of unknown spices. Kind of tastes like a Band Aid smells. Strange numbness on the palate. Little to enjoy here. Bottle.,pkbites
1483,Central City Beer League Powerplay,1.7,"Surrey, British Columbia","Clear yellow body and bleach white foam, about what you'd expect. Smells of rotting socks found in the dumpster behind your house. Flavour is sweet lagery hops, vague hints of booze and a cloying tinny aftertaste. Kind of what you might expect from this beer, though the alcohol is reasonably well hidden.",DeanF
