The nose is heavy mango, pineapple, hay and dust, wet grass, and corn syrup. Sweet and sugary, with a mild bitterness. Light body, with a fluffy, clean palate. This is a fun, fruity wheat, although the initial nose just reminds me of burning trashcan smell of potheads.",GTAEgeek

Aroma provides resiny and slightly dank hops, raw malt, tangy and slightly sweet citrus. Flavor offers piney and funky hops, raw malt, tangy and tart citrus, a hint of hay.

Aroma is lovely big mango and dry mango, some dank onion, some passionfruit, some orange, touch of lime.  This smells lovely.  Medium weight, starchy semi-textured, slightly oily feel, medium-light carbonation, medium-coarseness, medium-light burn, silky.  Nice feel!

20,Urban Artifact Astrolabe,3.5,"Cincinnati, Ohio","12 oz can from Tavour, 2/6/20.  Pours purple, smallish head, no lace.  Smells like Manischewitz.  Tastes along the same lines.  Bit of vanilla, slightly.  This works better as a beer than it does as a Passover wine, but it's still not amazing.  Concord grapes might be a fruit that's just better for eating than drinking.  I think it's well made, no complaints there.

Taste is highly sour (9/10) with flavors of raspberry, lemon; the medicinal and Band-Aid flavors are there in flavor, but not as in your face as in the nose. Flawed but drinkable.",poisoneddwarf

34,Strange Fellows Blackmail Milk Stout,3.3,"Vancouver, British Columbia","It's fine, I was expecting better. Paid a pretty penny for a limited imported run into Australia but isn't really that great in comparison to other milk stouts that are cheaper and more readily available here already.

Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.",saltyseadog

41,Beck's,2.1,"Bremen, Bremen","My old man's go to. Very important to get the imported variant rather than the domestically brewed stuff. Although, it's not really that great and I'd have a few choices over it at the price point. A bit bolder than the regular macro lager, but otherwise quite standard.",fellers
42,Gigantic Massive! - Cognac Barrel,4.2,"Portland, Oregon","Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours hazy ruddy brown with a slight beige head. Aroma of slight musty oak and brandy. Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt. This is excellent.",bhensonb

Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.",nearbeer

This is a drinkable, enjoyible IPA.",drjay44
55,Foothills Frostbite Black IPA,3.8,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Well I grabbed this brew from Foothills because I was curious if this was the same beer as the Cottonwood Frostbite winter ale I remember having many years ago at a beer festival. Although apparently Foothills bought out some of Cottonwood’s brands, this beer has a very different profile than what I remember of the Cottonwood rendition. Rather than being a boozy strong ale, this is a brisk clean-finishing and true-to-style black IPA with a fairly light roastiness and a balanced hoppy bitterness. The appearance was excellent also, with a bright white foamy head that almost imitated the cascading presentation of a Guinness stout. Aroma was charred wheat and herbal pacific hops, and the flavor likewise was a balanced mix of roasted malt and fresh bitter hops. Only mild disappointment with this beer was the lack of nuance - no complex chocolate or coffee notes or bold hop flavors - but that being said I enjoyed this and would pick it up again. Not my favorite black IPA, but possibly my favorite offering from Foothills Brewing.",eRock_2013
56,Four Mile Allegheny IPA,3.5,"Olean, New York",12 oz can. Pour is amber in color.Head is minimal but persistent. Aromas  of tropical fruit with no discernible dominant flavor.

57,Blackberry Farm Abbey Series - Quad,3.7,"Walland, Tennessee","375ml bottle. Clear, dark chestnut colour with ruby glimmer and small, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, beige head. Fruity, yeasty and slightly breadyand minimally nutty, malty aroma, notes of dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, sweet-ish and earthy hints of honey, some treacle, a touch of chestnut. Taste is dry, minimally sweet, minimally bitter, yeasty fruity and bready malty, notes of plum and cherry, dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, some treacle, honey, blue grapes, a touch of apple, baked apple, chestnut and even Brazil nut; minimally warming, alcoholic finish. Relatively watery texture with a minimally slimy touch, slightly prickly carbonation. Rich and complex, definitely a sipper, but partially so light and almost refreshing that you might be teased to speed up the frequency of sips into dangerous areas. Really nice and accommodating, but not exposing sufficient signs of individual character nor terroir to make a name for itself comparable to the classics in this style.",Idiosynkrasie

I don't know, it's fresh and spiky and very drinkable. But im left feeling refreshed with nothing else of note. It's a nice brew all the same. Pine notes, grapefruit. Not much body, served too cold for me. 

2 pints of this came in around the £11 mark and felt a bit robbed.... It's a nice beer but seriously Lidl are a great pils at 4.8% that I enjoy more. Sorry for the rant.",moatemalt
72,High Water West Meets East,5.0,"Chico, California","Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.

The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.

Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.

West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Finishes bittersweet, with a medium bitterness and some floral, grassy hops lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

Being quite impressed with everything I've had from Kundmüller before, this came as a bit of a disappointment to me, to be honest. I guess they wanted tro experiment with a dry-hopped Doppelbock and it's just not working for me because it's overly dominated by the quite floral and grassy hops, while the malts add little but sweetness here, that is at least somewhat balanced by the rather distinct bitterness though. Certainly a very different, unique Doppelbock that is very hoppy for the style, but not in a good way, and feels somewhat one-dimensional as well.",snowcrash000

Taste is a decent balance of doughy, bready lightly roasted and caramelly malt and estery yeast notes of banana and clove, with just a hint of, chocolate and raisins also coming through, as well as a light tartness developing in the aftertaste. Finishes with a light bitterness and some roasted notes, banana, clove and tartness lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

This ""Black Weizenbock"" certainly lives up to its name, being a lot more malt-focussed than your average Weizenbock, with some lightly roasted, caramel, chocolate and dark fruit notes coming through apart from the typical yeast esters. However, there's also a light tartness to this that seems somewhat displaced here. While the balance seems a little off, this still makes for quite an interesting and enjoyable brew at the end of the day. I would have wished for some stronger roasted notes and could have done without that light tartness though, which I'm not sure is really intended here. Almost seems just a tad oxidized, even though this should be reasonably fresh assuming a one-year best-by date.",snowcrash000

pours dark brown with a small smooth soon disappearing light brown to brown head.
Mild malty aroma with some subtle notes resembling brown cakes. fairly complex spicy thing going on with the browncakes.
flavor is sort of like browncakes, also fainter roasted malts. ever so slightly flowery or citrussy too, could be hops.
a bit boring , i think a heavier load of roasted malts would improve on things. comes off as slighlty thin and somewhat boring. Of course, done this way, you get more of the notes from the wood, which is what is special about this beer in the first place.

445,Cloudwater A Local Attraction,4.2,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","440ml can brewed in England at 4.3%. Sheer pastel orange with a picturesque head, decent duration. Orange juice aromas with some mango undertones and perhaps a hint of grapefruit. Lowish carbonation. Primarily orange-juicy, helped by the mouthfeel, with a pale malt serving to add very slight, gentle pithiness. Some slight mango tropical tints too. Smooth, sweet, bland in a good way - it's a bit like vanilla - sure it's plain, but who doesn't like vanilla? Especially well done vanilla. This is well done vanilla. Classic easy-drinker with classic hops, and just has that touch of class in how it's all put together that makes this absolutely, evidently craft and not supermarket fare. Balance of bitter and sweet is spot on too. I've had a lot of craft Pales that didn't quite meet the mark set here in sheer execution. But still, it's vanilla. Don't expect the world and this will do right by your tastebuds.",LagerGuide122

Medium to full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is good. This does not have the typical Darkness full body, but still solidly supports the barrel & chiles. Unsure how this would age. Lovin the cinnamon/barrel taste blend. Finishes sweetly, with barrel & cinnamon. This has an interesting blend. Multi dimensional with the chiles.

561,WellBeing Intentional IPA,3.7,"Maryland Heights, Missouri","Can (Dec 26, 2019 canning). Head is initially large, frothy, rocky, off-white, mostly lasting. Body is lightly hazy dark yellow to light amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, corn starch), lightly to moderately hoppy (grapefruit pith), with a light note of metal shavings. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation.

Certainly among the best NA beers available. Still room for improvement, mind you, as the the aroma doesn't really shout IPA (it's not really all that hoppy, just some generic pithy grapefruit that barely rises above the malt notes, and it's also slightly marred by a metallic/tinny odor). But wow, the appearance?! Big rocky heads are rare even in beers with alcohol. And a great mouth experience for an NA beer too...excellent lip-smacking sweet/bitter balance and quite a nice fluffy mouthfeel too. Such a shame they couldn't coax an assertive hoppy nose outta this one, and with more interesting hops (which seems like it would be the easiest part, right?)...this could've been near 4+ territory, which would be incredible for an NA beer!",Ernest

Taste brings lemon and piney hops, stone fruits, citrus, and honey, all on a solid sweet toffee backbone. Certainly hoppy, although muddled with the hop varietals, yet with that solid malt backbone. Some dry hop evidence, although not so much to completely dry this out. Almost full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is fine/solid. Finishes slightly to the sweet fruity side of bittersweet. Shrug? Congrats on 10 years for one of my obviously favorite breweries. This specific one winds up quite muddled. 13.8",AWISLguy

784,Wicked Weed El Paraiso (Bourbon Barrel),3.2,"Asheville, North Carolina","4 finger creamy beige head. Fantastic spider-web lacing.
Pitch black beer.

Aroma of vanilla, cocoa, hazelnut coffee, milk chocolate and a light brown round woodiness. Slight note of emptied oak barrel. Simple but effective.

Taste is similar at first but throws in a lot of acidic vinous notes along with a bigger gourmand presence and a clear boozy note. Not necessarily bourbon but a general spirit booziness.

Mouthfeel is somewhat dense and chewy but with a lighter landing that I don't fully appreciate. Sticky. Medium bitterness. Medium-low carbonation. Semi-long finish. 

Overall: Expected way more to be honest. Maybe it needs to warm up more to show its true potential. Been resting in the cabinet for quite a while too but it feels unbalanced and a bit all over the place.",EerieDrinks

A pleasing imperial stout delivers a polished experience without going overboard. It is hard to see much here that isn't available in a typical example of the style. Even so thanks to Drake for sharing this during a winter tasting.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Smoky coffee, espresso, and sticky hazy malts crawl over the nose in search of places to leave a mark. The fluid black base supports a lean mocha head.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky plum, dark fruit, and chocolate empower the rich profile that warms the throat. It then ebbs into a malty dense texture that sticks in the palate. There are few objections though nothing that stands out as an amazing release that sets itself apart in a busy crowd.",Brigadier

An excellent gem from the East Coast shows that Allagash is still on top of their game when it comes to balancing tartness with depth. It might not be my favorite release yet just thinking about it makes me wish that I had a glass to sip right now.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vinegary plums, raspberry, and a sharp abrasive profile gnaw at the nose. The vanilla head rests over a bed of caramel as the lean base swirls freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cherry and Sour Patch Kids imbued with raspberry cling to the senses as the vinegar works it way into every corner of the throat. A rich finish of freshly picked strawberries polish off an excellent experience. I would happily drink this again if I came across a tap line.",Brigadier

Well past its prime, this release shows what happens when you sit on a bottle too long. I can only imagine what it must have been like in its prime to still be this solid. If it weren't for the packed shelves I would love to try a few more Love Child releases.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A rich ivory head dances upwards as the caramel body chews at the foundation. A strong sour intensity has taken root as the brett is center stage. Behind it the musty profile indicates other aspects have mellowed with time.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Acidic astringent chocolate tickles the tongue. Clearly past its prime, this Flemish sour hits the palate with a harsh bite. Even the finish, tart Tootsie Roll, shows signs of having been more polished in the past. It will be nice to get more of these out of the cellar to make room for fresher offerings.",Brigadier

The packaging drew me in but despite having a bottle in the cellar I finally caved and ordered a draft at a local bar. I'm happy though as the results are subpar for a Central Waters imperial stout. This is less imperial and more mundane. Save your money for their other more polished releases.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A delicate mocha head rests above the fluid black base. Moving freely around the shaker it releases droves of smoky ash, espresso, and cocoa in a profile that feels a bit tame for the style. 

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky espresso, malt, and cocoa enrich the palate with a fluid refreshing feel that dances rather than crawls over the tongue. Given the description I was anticipating a bit more. I'll still crack open the bottle to see if I get better results but overall this feels like a half hearted effort from Amherst.",Brigadier

A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate.

This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic.

With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.

Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.

This particular style has piqued my curiosity for a while. Either I'm suddenly seeing these everywhere or more breweries are trying to set themselves apart with something unique. Regardless this is well worth sampling at the source as part of a flight.

I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness.

A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.

Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.

04-02-2020; bottle; at home (bought at de Bodega, Capelle Aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. 
The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.",Gangstergafje

900,Northern Monk / By The River Northern Powerhouse Brew Series 2019 007,4.5,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!",LagerGuide122

929,Green Flash Double Columbus IPA,3.2,"San Diego, California","January 18th, 2014 - My best guess is that this beer is going to be a gob smack of Columbus hops, practically dripping out of the bottle with resin and pine. And that's exactly what I get. But before I get to the very succinct review (half of the word count is ""resin""), I want to admire the look, which in this slightly fluted glass has a beautiful auburn color with a good finger of head, and a rich population of geysers. The aroma is sticky, fresh and resinous, and direct with it's hop profile, as expected. The flavor has one foot in the pine camp and the other in a rusty metallic taste. It is intense, and squeezes a long line of honey through the taste to give this a super sweet flavor, which gets tiring by the end of the glass. But those first few bold sips are fine to get an idea of how strong a directly and forward Columbus hops based beer can be.",GarrettB

Aroma of dried wakame, old coriander seed, sourdough, sour apples, old dry lemon peel, some lime zest, bread crust.  Crisp, sour onset, lemony, sour apples but also a subtle sweetish pineapple accent, minerally carbonation, drying lactic tartness throughout accompanied by a light seaweed saltiness – but remaining very light, much lighter in fact than in most modern Goses (and probably closer to the salty level of historical Gose).  Some chicken broth-like ‘meatiness’ in the end, over a wheaty-bready, slick maltiness, spiced by a dash of old coriander seed.  Pretty nice, seemingly a bit more complex than the average modern Gose, but at the same time more restrained and less salty as well.

Sweet onset with impressions of dried fig and date as well as some apple peel and blue plum; medium carb, full oily and bit vinous mouthfeel.  Caramelly malt core with a soft brown-bready edge as well as an upcoming smoky note, reminiscent of smoked sausages and even (vaguely) bonfire, plunging into a long, warming, complex finish coloured by a late peppery hop bitter touch, lingering malt sweetness and smokiness as well as brandy-like alcohol.

Fruity, estery onset, sour with a sweetish core, impressions of blackberry, fig and sour plums, soft carb, strong lactic sourness drying the palate, over a caramelly, softly bready malt backbone; woody tannins add further dryness in the finish, with a strong and evidently unsurprising impression of dry and tannic red wine (‘gecorseerd’ as we say in Dutch), quite complex, woody, fruity long and warming.

1010,Brix City Island Jams,3.8,"Little Ferry, New Jersey","Coconut- and pineapple-flavoured milkshake IPA, thanks Sérgio (the brewer of Totenhopfen in Luxemburg) for sharing.  Papery lacing, off-white, mousy, stable head on a misty apricot blonde beer with ochre-ish hue.  Aroma very strongly coconut-forward (coconut milk), some pineapple jam but much less outspoken than the coconut, blood orange, vanilla custard, dough, milk powder, powder sugar, ground hazelnuts somewhere, nougat.  Sweet and creamy onset with a citric twist to it, pineapple indeed in a candied- or jam-like way, hints of mango, lychee and blood orange, fizzy carb (quite sharpish for the style but not to a bothersome degree); full, supple, soft body with lactose creaminess – and sweetness on top of the malt sweetness.  Becomes highly aromatized very quickly, by tropical hops (mango) but even more so by vanilla (love it) and most predominantly so by the coconut; some light and late powdery bitterness lingers, but creamy lactose sweetness and coconut last for a long(er) time.  This is about as decadent as it gets in the vast IPA world, but I seem to have a thing for milkshake IPAs if they are well done, and that certainly is the case here.  This kind of desserty sweetness was unthinkable in any IPA as little as ten years ago, but here we are – products like this are bound to attract a large audience, and frankly I would like to see an adventurous Belgian brewery tackle this offspring of the ubiquitous New England IPA (the only one who has successfully done a milkshake IPA in this country so far that I know of, is Totem, so hopefully others will follow).",Alengrin

J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur. Un manque d'envolée lyrique qui nous empêche une parfaite élévation spirituelle, mais une double bien faîte et agréable.",jybi

1103,Wylam Greenbutt Skunk,3.1,"Newcastle upon Tyne , Tyne & Wear","Northern English double NEIPA, from tap at Bar Beenhouwer in Ghent.  Egg-white, membrane-lacing, creamy, thin, irregularly edged and eventually all but dissolving head, cloudy yolk-yellow robe with pale orangey tinge – the whole thing quickly looks like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Aroma of mandarin, mango, ripe pineapple juice, sweetish with a sourish edge, fizzily carbonated; soft doughy malt body, completely drenched in dank, very sultry, tropical hoppiness, sweet-citrusy and a bit mango-like, but with a powdery, weedy bitterishness in the end as well – though eventually more bitterness comes from wodka-like alcohol, emphasizing an overall effect I can only describe as Screwdriver-like.  Typical new wave double NEIPA, mimicking orange juice with wodka poured in.",Alengrin
1104,Vibrant Forest Dahlia,3.2,"Hardley, Hampshire","Chardonnay barrel aged, light ‘session’ sour, from a waxed bomber bought at Geers in Oostakker near Ghent.  Thin and loose, mousy, bubbly, snow white head disappearing completely in the end, misty pale yellowish straw blonde robe with lime-greenish tinge.  Aroma of diluted lemon juice, indeed Chardonnay wine and white grape skin, green apple, soap, buttermilk, lime, dough, fried ‘courgette’, pumice.  Restrained fruity esters (green banana, green apple) in a softly lactic-sour, minerally environment, softly carbonated, with a soapy wheatiness and cereally main maltiness in the middle; drying lactic sourness in the end too, but remaining fairly gentle, while wood tannins from the barrels remain all but absent.  Still, the finish does bring a notable white wine flavour, which in the end adds some complexity to the whole; lots of chalkiness lingering too, though.  Soft sour ‘afterburn’.  Fruity, not lacking in complexity but it does lack in the promised Brett and wood effects, even if the Chardonnay is certainly there.  Feels like a Berliner Weisse with a dash of Chardonnay thrown in, and that is probably not that far removed from the truth.  Interesting, but too expensive for what it is and delivering only half of what it promises.",Alengrin

1112,M.I.A. Miami Weiss,2.6,"Miami, Florida","Perfectly clear deep copper and almost amber coloured body with a decent two centimetre tall, very soapy white head that fades to literally nothing on top - just like a soda - pretty bad, actually. Aroma of wheat, bubble gum, oranges, a dash of curacao and some softer earthy and malt components that make this okay, but not great, in the nose, at least. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong wheatie and yeastie flavours dominate with a large cardboardie and funky flavour at first that shows some light orange and curacao notes, a dash of citrus, a little grain and some more assertive sugars that show caster sugar notes and a slight touch of fruit-based sugars. Aftertaste shows the more dry and slighlty softer flavours from the malt with a dry and orangey finish that has some light sweetness, but mostly the stale or funky wheat-based malt profile that doesn't have any complexities or depth from the yeast strain at all. Overall, a pretty poor beer overall, and definitely not a respectable FILTERED wheat beer as this definiteliy shows as a Wheat Ale, and even then, not a good one with bad/old wheat notes, no real yeast depth and no other complexities from other notes - just the wheat shows through, in a not-so-good way.

The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!",J_man

It still has a bit of that cheap white character, but that vinous note is a bit snappier, as the acidity comes in a touch.

1286,Upland Paw Paw,5.0,"Bloomington, Indiana","Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. 

The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.

Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.",Idiosynkrasie

1297,Left Hand White Russian Nitro,3.1,"Longmont, Colorado","Pours a clear, golden amber coloration with a small, creamy, stable head. Smells of sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with just a hint of actual coffee. Taste is very much dominated by sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with some hazelnut also coming through, as well as just a hint of coffee and white chocolate. Finishes almost sickly sweet, with some coffee cream and vanilla lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While this does an ok job at imitating a White Russian, it's just way too syrupy sweet and creamy/milky for an enjoyable Imperial Stout, with the vanilla being way overdone and very little coffee coming through. While the mouthfeel is all right, I expected more from a nitro can. Nobody loves the Big Lebowski more than me, but this does not tie it together very well at all, no need to be careful about this beverage.

Aroma is lemon-lime, grass, pale malts, and a little dough.  Some light citrus notes as well.  Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.

1411,Siren Bourbon Turkish (Project Barista - 2019) ,3.5,"Finchampstead, Berkshire","330ml glass bottle from Seven Seasons, Hoxton. Served at cellar temperature into a stout glass. Dated as bottled on 17/05/19. 

The beer pours a perfect black colour developing a one and a half finger mocha colour head. Uniform with medium sized bubbles. The head settles to a thick layer before finally disappearing half way through the drink. A lovely lacing. Visually this one looks like a top beer. 

The aroma has an identical profile to tiramisu. Heavy dark roasted coffee. Vanilla. Woody. Muscovado. Figs. Coffee, and the woody smell of the barrel ageing are the dominant notes. Nasally stunning. 

The taste is where the beer deviates away from great, in my opinion. Too alcoholic. I do understand the beer is 11.5% and imperial in style, but on the tastebuds the alcohol dominates and little else is present. I feel as the only reason I can taste coffee, vanilla or oak is because of the strength of aroma leading to perception. The beer is moderately sweet. 

The beer feels thick in the mouth, a lot of alcohol warmth, also in the pit of the stomach. A slightly dry, moderately sweet feel. 

Maybe just too much for my palate. A great beer for look and aroma but too heavily dominated by booze on the taste. 

One I’d put in the same category as Samuel Smiths Chocolate Stout. I think it would be good in a very small amount. But even on a slow slow drink 330 feels far too much. A sharer.",PubTun33
