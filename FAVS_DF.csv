1,Maine Beer Zoe,4.1,"Freeport, Maine","500 ml. bottled 10/29/2019. Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.",nearbeer
2,De Dolle Stille Nacht,4.7,"Diksmuide, Belgium","Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.",sakimori
3,Tree House Jjjuliusss,4.3,"Charlton, Massachusetts","Acquired a can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom! Can date of 1-21-20. Is this any different than then King Julius? Maybe a tad more juice? How much juice can one IPA actually have? After reviewing my notes of king Julius...  Yes this has a huge juicy character. This also has absolutely no bitterness. No green hop either. So the fruit juice, lasts and lasts and lasts. This really is tasty. Soooo, ok... I like it.

16,Funky Buddha No Crusts,2.5,"Oakland Park, Florida","Brown with a foamy head that soon turns whispy. Big medicinal aroma, a cherry/raspberry blend cough syrup. Herbal too though. With a bit of time out of the bottle it really does start to smell like a PB&J. The intense peanuty note is probably the highlight of this brew. Taste is bittersweet, full of earthy peanut shell and sweet artificial cough drop. Body is medium, carbonation moderate, texture watery. Probably the most disappointing tough 50 brew I‘ve tried, at least for such a major style.",hauxe

27,Moonlight Lunatic Lager,3.6,"Santa Rosa, California","Poured from a 16 oz can. 
Aroma is malt forward with lots of grain, cracker, biscuit and toasted bread notes. Light herbal, spicy hop notes with hints of floral character. 
Pours a slightly hazy, brilliant gold color with a large, thick, frothy, white head that recedes slowly to a small film that lingers a bit on the edges. Moderately high lacing and no legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with moderately strong grain notes of bread, cracker, and biscuit. Moderately strong bitterness with medium light hop notes of woody, herbal and spicy notes with faint floral character and a hint of fruit esters. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty enjoyable lager. Nice malt notes with assertive bitterness and hop notes. Hop notes and bitterness are not too strong though and malt is still center stage.",ineedbeer
28,Firestone Walker 14,3.4,"Paso Robles, California","Poured from 12 oz. bottle. 

Clear, bright yellow with a 2-finger near white head and good lacing. 

Aroma of white grapes, a strange citrus-like aroma I don’t recognize and exotic tropical fruit. 

Taste follows the nose closely.  

Medium body and medium carbonation. 

This has a distinctive hopping that is nothing like anything I’ve experienced before. I welcome the addition to the brewmaster’s pallet, but I find this beer is a little too grapey for my taste.",MadRobin

33,Surly Barrel Aged Darkness (2016 - ),4.0,"Minneapolis, Minnesota","On tap at Champps in Brookfield. 2017 version! Very dark brown pour. Aroma hits with barrel & dark fruits. Taste has barrel, dark fruits, sweet malts. Medium to full bodied, a bit of a surprise for a Darkness brew, the blend is good, and there is a solid alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly with barrel.

38,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),4.4,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","Copenhagen 26/12 2018. 35,5 cl bottle from Voldby Købmandsgård Webshop. This is the 2016 release with an ABV of 11,9. The Classic label with the tagline “Is good for everything a flavoured stout ought to be good for”.

Pours opaque dark brown with small beige head. Settles as thin, transparent layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. 

Aroma is very intensive, sweet with a nice boozy backbone. Sweet chocolate and caramel. Like coming into a candystore offer9ng Classic chocolates. Shoe cream, vanilla, coffee. Powerful alcohol lurking in the background. 

Low carbonation. Thick, oily and creamy texture. Have to work a bit to get it out of the glass. 

Flavor is heavy sweet. Followed by more moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is long and sweet with a spicy undercurrent. Lingers for a long sweet while.

An excellent gem from the East Coast shows that Allagash is still on top of their game when it comes to balancing tartness with depth. It might not be my favorite release yet just thinking about it makes me wish that I had a glass to sip right now.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vinegary plums, raspberry, and a sharp abrasive profile gnaw at the nose. The vanilla head rests over a bed of caramel as the lean base swirls freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cherry and Sour Patch Kids imbued with raspberry cling to the senses as the vinegar works it way into every corner of the throat. A rich finish of freshly picked strawberries polish off an excellent experience. I would happily drink this again if I came across a tap line.",Brigadier

60,Westmalle Dubbel,4.4,"Malle, Belgium","J'avais une certaine appréhension en decapsulant cette Westmalle double tant la triple est pour moi un graal absolu et tant le style des doubles est un style compliqué. J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur. Un manque d'envolée lyrique qui nous empêche une parfaite élévation spirituelle, mais une double bien faîte et agréable.",jybi

64,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,4.1,"Chico, California","12 oz. bottle from a six-pack brought back from Raley's in Chico, CA.  The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!",J_man
65,Lost Abbey Red Poppy Ale,2.3,"San Marcos, California","Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.

72,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!",saltyseadog

Aromas of whiskey, roasty, chocolate, with hints of oak, molasses and vanilla. Tastes of sweet bourbon whiskey, roasty, chocolate, molasses, and oak, with notes of vanilla and caramel and maybe even some char. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, although perhaps a little sweet for me, the roast and chocolate did mostly balance it out for me, and it was still an enjoyable sipper.",davidezdonz

80,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,4.5,"Chico, California",Sierra Nebmvada really knows how to celebrate an anniversary. Their 40th IPA is truly a victory of brewing. It's a balanced affair that channels their west coast pedigree while still delivering interest and quality. A solid light malt backbone lifts an impressive resiny piney hop bill that is both familiar and engaging at the same time.  Nice long hoppy finish that still manages to avoid rindiness. Quite clean. Awesome lacing too. This is why they are the west coast kings.,freekyp

A noter qu'il est toujours très agréable de rencontrer le yéti en février,
surtout quand les températures du jour et du lieu avoisinaient les 24° C.
Mon exemplaire, de Denver, Colorado, était à 9 mois avant sa date.
Couleur noir profond aux reflets marron grillé, à l'opacité très forte.
Mousse brun roux foncé, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de cèdre, baies noires macérées en péket, chêne liège brûlé.
1ère bouche très souple, sur un bois brûlé de la plus belle manière …
(si l'on peut dire, et sans être un pyromane ...)
Arrière-bouche avec une impression de strong dry stout.
2ème bouche avec café serré, poivre, muscade, tabac brun.
Arrière-bouche qui entre dans la complexité, avec une allégresse vive.
Longueur qui trouve pas mal de zestes dans ce café taillé au couteau ..
Jambes très huileuses, limite grasses, très longues.
Levure boisée, vernissée, belle ligne.
Alcool fort, plus haut que son niveau, il fait un 10,5 % tranquille,
mais il se révèle un peu emprisonné sur la longueur …
Il ne peut trouver d'autres issues aux saveurs, juste un peu ""coincées"".
Finale intéressante, sans problème, mais oh combien discutable ..
CONCLUSION : le yéti est un personnage séduisant (de loin ..), mais
incontestablement excessif, dans tous les sens du terme, et donc si
on est un biérophile averti, on ne va pas lui trouver de 5 à la cote, 
malgré les pages qui en sont remplies … Yéti soit qui mal y pense !!
Moralité : grande division (divide) sur la présence de ce yéti .. à 24° C.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Sadly this suffers from one of SN's oldest problems...too much raw vitamin B yeast odor. The hop aroma is simple, but it's quietly pleasant I suppose. Easy-quaffing flavor balance works a bit better, but overall it's pretty underwhelming and dull. But hey, at least it isn't dirty like most modern IPAs.",Ernest

278,Cloudwater / Salt Proper,4.2,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","440ml can brewed in England at 6.2%. Near-black pour, black in the glass. Brown head, decent size, OK duration. Low carbonation. Slight but deep stout aroma, hints of wood. Taste follows, with a particular dry, roasted finish. Very nice stout, and at least going by the label, its flavour is accomplished without actual additions of coffee or cacao - always a plus, especially from a talented organisation like Cloudwater, who really ought to be able to make a killer stout with minimal to no additions. Then again, I just don't know how much of this beer is down to them and how much to Salt. The label is a bit flowery, but ""toasted teacake base"" does describe the malt here quite well - at least the none-roast elements. This is a stouty stout, and a good example of what a stout can be that a porter can not - any chocolate flavour here is minimal, and very much on the dark side, and the roast flavour overpowers any out-and-out coffee elements. Sweetness is there, but appears to emanate from the beer, so to speak. The dry, almost ashy finish is the key note of this beer, and quite a welcome taste. Good flavour for the ABV - I wish Cloudwater would add a good stout or two to their core range some time, as they clearly have the ability to make a strong contender in the style if they put their mind to it. Something like this would fit the bill, along with perhaps an Imperial. Just saying!",LagerGuide122

Medium to barely Full-bodied; Strong rich malt notes that shows the roasted malt, a bunch of coffee and earth with a touch of peanuts and cashew flavours show through with a lot of alcohol and boozy qualities and a rich sweetness finishes it off nicely. Aftertaste shows the deep cognac and scotch notes with a lot of alcohol pungency, but the earth, coffee, lactose and cream notes somehow shine through even stronger, with a lot of anise and licorice bitterness still around and some softer sugars at the tail end make this somewhat balanced, but still strong, and perhaps a touch thin. Overall, a rich and earthy beer with a ton of boozy warmth throughout with a lot of the cognac and whiskey notes that can't be hidden, but the anise and fennel flavours are strong as well, and the two years haven't tempered it or made it mellow, and this is quite strong and pungent throughout. Overall, a deeper and more pungent beer than I expected, especially after a few years in the bottle, with a deep robust punch from the malt and alcohol with a lot of boozy flaovurs and anise notes with a touch of vanilla. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 28-December-2017 for US$4,49 sampled at home in Washington, just over two years later on 27-January-2020.",jgb9348

Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/resinous/drying finish; Nicely soft and not overly aggressive. Awesome Centennial, Cascade profile. Very vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized oat/dark/bready malt backbone. Mild residual sweetness with lingering crisp resin dryness.

691,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,3.8,"Chico, California","6-Pack of 12 ounce bottles - $10.99 at Publix in Marietta, Georgia.

PKGD 12/16/19.

Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy, golden-amber body with a medium-small, whitish head.

Smell: A little caramel and honey-brushed biscuit, subtly bready with restrained citrus, florals, pine and black peppercorn.

Taste: Modestly sweet, bready and biscuity with a light flourish of honey, blonde caramel. Citusy, light pine. Peppery, a teensy bit earthy, some rustic woodsiness. Citrus quality picks up a little lime on the tailend, particularly as it warmed. Medium bitterness. A final lick of orange blossom honey before the gently drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp yet displays a scant oily texture.

Overall: 40th feels like a beer someone would've tried to slap the Extra Pale Ale moniker onto. Nothing too terribly groundbreaking or over-the-top whimsical. I, myself will be turning forty this year and neither need nor expect much fanfare or ribaldry, content to just keep sailing along.",ChainGangGuy

719,Unibroue Trois Pistoles,5.0,"Chambly, Quebec","Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.

The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.

Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.

Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

733,Founders Backstage Series # 1: Blushing Monk,2.9,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","La brasserie Funders se tourne clairement ici vers les jeunes et la gente féminine avec une bière douce, aux accents de rosé et de grenadine. Pas de quoi se passionner pour un amateur de bière, et la question de se poser s'il n'est tout de même pas possible d'offrir mieux pour avoir une première approche de la bière à certains segments marketing (car il ne faut pas se le cacher nous touchons ici au marketing). Il est certain qu'ici, une touche d'acidité pour donner du pep's aurait été appréciable, tout comme un sucre un peu moins présent (mais ici tout est fait pour cacher l'alcool, car nous sommes tout de même chez les jeunes dans un paradoxe il faut boire de l'alcool, mais sans se rendre compte que c'est de l’alcool !). Sur la bière en elles même je n'ai malheureusement pas grand-chose à dire, le visuel est sur un rosé foncé sans mousse. Le nez est sur un mélange entre le vin rosé et grenadine et c'est d'ailleurs le duo que l'on retrouve de l'attaque au final en passant par l'arrière bouche avec tout de même un brin d'épices. C'est linéaire, poussif, avec un alcool à 9,2 % que l'on cache. Si la corpulence est honnête, la longueur est courte. Ce n'est pas parce que certains boivent n'importe quoi, qu'il faut brasser n'importe quoi.... Au contraire il faut amener ces personnes via des produits de qualité adaptés à apprécier la bière.",jybi

795,Anchor Porter,3.2,"San Francisco, California","330ml bottle from Drinkers Paradise in Kentish Town for £2.50. Served at cool room temperature into a tumbler. The date code on the back label had worn slightly, all I could make out was 2020. 

The beer pours an almost jet black colour, with a thick look. A one and a half finger muscovado colour head generates. Loose looking and quick to dissipate away. 

The first aroma to strike is overwhelming liquorice. This also dominates the first gulps on taste. However, it soon does away to leave light aromas of dark dried fruits, raisins. Roasted malt is also prevalent.

As aforementioned, liquorice dominates the early exchanges before fading away. Dark dried fruit, roasted malt and limited espresso then take the fore. I found the taste a little overbearing, too much going on for my tastebuds. 

The drink leaves the mouth feeling just slightly dry. The taste of the malt and dark fruit do linger like a strong coffee for some time in the mouth. Pleasant.

Overall, I got a mixed level of enjoyment from this beer. The flavours just didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Well made but not something I’d seek out again.",PubTun33

800,Stone Enjoy By IPA - Unfiltered,3.7,"Escondido, California","Quite hazy deep golden and orange coloured body with a very soapy and quite tall, off-white head, about four centimetres tall that stays afloat for a long time. Aroma of alcohol, crisp grassy, citrusey and very herbal hopswith a lot of alpha acids, quite a bit of sweetness from fruits and a lot of malt as a good backbone. Medium-bodied; Rich deep flavour of alcohol, strong citrus, a lot of dry grassy and herbal flavours and showing almost a perfect balance of significant hops and associated bitterness with a lot of malt - mostly dry and grassy, with a nice layer of sweet and astringency from the alcohol and residual sugars. Aftertaste shows all the flavours melded into one consistent package, which has the right balance and potency - the hops hit strong, the malt is supportive and the complexity is nice, especially for the style. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA which shows some classy notes and a complex, dry and bitter West Coast IPA vibe that actually make this worth drinking/finding from Stone (a surprise, actually!), even a few days past the 'due date'. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Whole Foods in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia on 18-December-2019 for US$2,99 sampled a bit less than a month later on 14-January-2020 at my house in Washington a few blocks away.",jgb9348

Aroma of alcohol, roasted malt, bunches of vanilla pods, anise, a dose of caramelised sugars and a heavy strong molasses and lactose note - very nice. Medium-bodied; Strong rich malty and milk-based/cream flavours dominate at first with bunches of roasted malt, anise and deeper flavours that have a lot of bitterness, but also a bunch of sweetness that all end with a strong alcohol bite, but tempered by the grain and the sugars, which are quite pervasive. Medium to almost Full-bodied; Strong rich grainy and oatmeal flavours dominate with mostly malt up front, but the molasses and caramelised sugar flavours dominate soon afterwards and lead into the more sweet flavours of vanilla and of course - loads of chocolate with a light bitterness from coffee at the end. Aftertaste shows a dense creamy, lactose and milky finish with a lot of body and a good deal of balancing sugars in the form of raisins and chocolate. Overall, a very nice milk stout that shows some deeper characteristics, while being fairly easy-to-drink and very smooth around the edges, even for being a very fresh beer!

Smells of doughy, slighty grainy malt and quite floral hops, with just a hint of herbal, citrus accents. Taste is a good balance of sweet'ish doughy, slightly grainy malt and quite floral, slightly herbal hops, with some hay and lime peel coming through as well. Finishes quite crisp, with a very light bitterness and some floral hops and lime peel lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.

While this is pretty good for a light lager, with a great balance of sweet malts and floral, slightly herbal citrus hops, it still is what it is, with a pretty light body and flavor profile. Crisp and semi-dry, with a light bitterness, this is sure is easy-drinking and refreshing, but still seriously lacking in flavor. I've done my best to rate this to style, but I'm not sure just how far you can take this style. I mean, sure, it's a lot better than Coors Light, but what does that really say?

827,Westmalle Tripel,4.2,"Malle, Belgium","May 28, 2019 bottling date.
BB May 28, 2021

Taken from a 44°F fridge, pour begins after ~5+ min.

Aroma is banana, spices, floral, sweet malts.

Color is gold, slightly hazy, plenty of rising bubbles to a 1/2 inch white, thick, and creamy-appearing head from a fairly gentle pour, which quickly falls to a 1/4 inch thick creamy cap.

Taste is spicey backed by the fruit tastes - banana, perhaps other indistinct (apple, maybe), with a solid sweet-ish floral backing. The spiciness is very peppery, and the banana and apple(?) carry throughout.  The floral breadiness adds a lift to the taste that is quite nice. Little alcohol present in the taste, but you can definitely feel it about half way through.  Only a very slight bitterness in the beginning that is pretty much gone by the middle. The finish is sticky and semi-sweet.

Medium feel, tilting to the thin side, but the primary feel is the carbonation tingling counteracting the creamy smoothness.

Overall, dangerously too easy to drink quickly given the ABV; I needed to consciously slow down, because I found it too enjoyable; I just wanted to just sip, sip, and sip again. An excellent tripel.

Nearly black from the front, dark ruby with a backlight.  Tall, thick, khaki head, creamy, with good retention. As it recedes, the top is cratered and bubbly, leaving good looking thick strings of lacing down the glass. Ample rising bubbles visible.

Taste is roasted coffee/malts, and as with the aroma, hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Mild bitterness shows up in the middle and carries through to the finish and aftertaste.  The finish is semi-dry with the mild hops bitterness providing excellent balance to the dark malts. This lingers into the aftertaste.

The body has some heft for the style, but objectively medium bodied tending toward the thin side.  The mouth feel is somewhat dry with good carbonation sparkling.

Overall, an excellent Robust Porter. To my taste, in the same class as the Founders, only slightly better in the strength of the aroma and taste.",MNAle

The nose has coffee to the fore, but plenty of citrus in the background.  The initial taste is sharpness, bitter like lettuce base.  But there is also coffee and chocolate with burnt toast hints.  The finish is bitter black coffee, and alcoholic warmth in the stomach.  Excellent !

884,Timothy Taylor's Landlord (Bottle),4.4,"Keighley, West Yorkshire","500ml bottle brewed in England at 4.1%. Crystal-clear copper colour. Nice-sized fair-duration head. Aroma of sweet brown bread malt and tangerine citrus. Moderate- carbonation. Surprisingly dark toasty malt, mingling with gentle but tangible tangerine citrus, touching base on their respective bitter ends. Really nicely balanced, and surprisingly thick and full of flavour (if fairly straightforward), never mind for the ABV. The care taken and quality of ingredients also come across, partly in the yeast character (surprisingly discernible for so clear a beer) but especially the water - this beer is approximately 95% water, and the imparted character from the unique source is quite noticeable and well-received! A living legend, not much better out there now for a pub drink, and if it's overrated it's only in the same way the Beatles were. Don't go into this expecting an all-singing all-dancing craft-style experience, this is an old school best-of-class, and lives up to its reputation. Also damned inexpensive to pick a few bottles up, another thing to be thankful for. A smooth luxurious 'session' ale, perfect pub fare, exuding quality - but if there's anything to take away from this beer it's how inoffensive it is. Part of the reason this is so many people's favourite ales is how it just doesn't put a foot wrong; not everyone has it as their favourite tipple, but how many have a bad word to say about it? Exactly.",LagerGuide122

Apparence : Noire, col et carbonatation absents (bière de deux ans tout de même).    
Nez :  Chocolat noir, malt grillé, fut, aspect épicé sans que celles-ci soient clairement indentifiables.  
Goût : L'entrée est marquée par les mêmes arômes qu'au nez puis, on a une transition vers une finale plus pimentée et quelque peu plus torréfiée. Si l'entrée est plus sur les notes sucrées du chocolat et du malt, la finale se veut plus épicée et amère, bien que ce soit contrôlé.   
Sensation : Corps moyen-plus, fort chaleureuse, aspect pimenté en bouche, bonne longueur.

994,Founders Centennial IPA,3.8,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","Bottle; supermarket in Copenhagen.

Pours a cloudy, deep golden with a touch of red. Frothy head - the foam sticks nicely. Inviting rose and hops scent. Taste is initially fresh, spicy hops accompanied by a floral, slightly fruity, kick. Then it turns more grassy and... mineral-y, almost like pine. 

It's intoxicating, and not just literally (although the presence of ethanol is clear as the hoppy bitterness fades). 

A product worthy of marking a centennial celebration (assuming this was its purpose).

Aroma is spice forward with lots of coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise and allspice. Light dark roast notes with toasted bread and a light nuttiness. 
Both bottles pour a dark brown, almost black with a large, thick, creamy, mocha head that recedes slowly. The head on the older bottle is a bit darker. Medium lacing and moderately long legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with light roast, chocolate and toasted bread notes. Moderate bitterness and light alcohol spice. So much spice though. Tons of coriander, clove, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low,but present alcohol warmth.

The beer pours a dark burnt orange colour. No real head generates but carbonation is visible through the clear liquid. 

The aroma feels very standard of the style. Caramel malts, light citrus hop. Beery, as my other half would say. 

The taste follows the aroma. Crisp, clean with a low slight bitterness. Citrus, low caramel, low biscuit. 

A medium level of carbonation on the tongue. A balanced but short lived aftertaste. 

Overall, a standard bearer for the style. Very well made. Slightly overrated in my opinion.",PubTun33

Clear amber with some bubbles rising but it's lighter than expected. The head is fluffy & white, holding very well with good lacing too. The smell was a fresh & hoppy one with floral notes & a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus & grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine & subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated & medium with a clean feel & the alcohol content is hidden well too. Very nice & easy to drink; not the best DIPA I've had but it is certainly up there.",flying_pig

Bringing it closer revealed grapefruit and peach predominantly. The taste was quite sour at first, which was a little surprising.

Color is dark brown from the front, murky ruby red with a back light.  1/3 inch tan head from a careful pour into the chalice, thick, creamy, uneven top, excellent retention. Thick sheets of lacing on the opposite side. Upward showers of bubbles.

Taste is somewhat bitter in the beginning, and this remains in the background throughout. Dark fruits, raisins, mild spiciness.  The taste is fairly complex, with the interplay of fruit, spice, and a dry bitterness that borders on astringency. The bitterness is more like bitter coffee (albeit with no coffee taste) rather than bitter hops. The finish is surprisingly toward dry, given the sweetness of the aroma.

Feel is smooth and a bit thin.

Deep dark brown, almost touching black. A small finger and a half tan head. Dissipates quickly. 

The aroma is heavily malt driven, molasses, caramel, confectioners sugar and dark dried fruit. Some limited apple. 

The taste is sweet and heavily malty. Dark fruit and molasses. Easily drinkable, similar to a English strong ale. Fruit cake-like. Flavour balance not present but does not diminish the enjoyment.

Sweet in the mouth. Lingering malty, molasses tastes. An unexpected amount of carbonation that is fairly lively.

Taste is deep syrupy coffee liqueur in a good way, maple is helping to smooth and balance everything out. Mouthfeel is  smooth and chewy, warming, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I'm not sure how it could get better than this. Nonetheless this is very good, heavy but extremely balanced.

1236,Three Floyds Zombie Dust,4.3,"Munster, Indiana","Good, solid aroma of citrus and pine. Hints of something sweeter - pineapple, perhaps?

1/2 inch thick, creamy white head with decent retention, leaving thick lacing and a pitted surface as it drops. Color is clear deep amber with ample rising bubbles.

Initial feel is thick (for an APA) and smooth, which remains pretty much throughout until it is overcome by a bitter middle and finish.

Initial taste repeats the citrus from the aroma, with a substantial malt sweetness behind.  The middle becomes more piney and bitter, but the bitterness is always controlled by the balancing sweet malts. Aftertaste is piney and moderately bitter. The finish is tending toward dry, but enough sweetness remains that it never actually gets there. 

Overall, this is an excellent APA. Hoppy, but well-balanced and delicious.

Aroma of crisp grass, pine, light malts with some grain and a dash of hay towards the end. Light-bodied; Strong grassy and herbal flavours dominate with a lot of dry malts and some subtle hops along with a touch of sweetness and a clean, very easy-drinking yeast bite towards the end that showcases the malts as well. Aftertaste is pure and clean with the yeast and malt coming out front and centre and the hops not really showing nor any sweetness, graininess or character. Overall, a pretty understated and soft beer, and even though that's what you'd expect from the style, I was thinking that from the brewery you'd get a bit more character and depth, but that isn't the case here - this is easy drinking and a pure Pils without any real class.

1371,Goose Island Bourbon County Barleywine,4.6,"Chicago, Illinois","Bár még csak egy alkalommal volt szerencsém a legendához, a Bourbon County-sorozattal már akkor életre szóló barátságot kötöttem, a sörfőzés ilyen szintű magasfoka mellett egyszerűen nem lehet úgy elmenni, hogy az ember ne arra gondoljon, magát az etalont kóstolgatja éppen, amikor a Goose Island örökbecsű darabjait ízleli meg. Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban. A legnemesebb tölgyes, fahordós, whiskyben ázó dohányleveles, bőrszerű, őszi faleveles aromák, amihez kékvérű test bársonyos, csillogó jegyei társulnak, a maguk ezerszínű palástját felöltve, melyet órákig csodálhatunk, betelni mégsem tudunk vele. Az aromák folyékony halmazállapotba kerülve konyakmeggy, vanília, bourbon, csipkebogyólekvár és füstös eperdzsem varázslatos keverékét adják, melyet angolszász stílusban közvetítenek, teret engedve azonban minden elem vibrálásának, így téve lehetővé végtelennek tetsző részletességű komponenseinek érvényesülését, melyek egyenként is művészi értékkel bírnak.

Creamy, mocha-beige, dense and stable, thick head on a black beer with thin mahogany edge.  Aroma of coffee cream, mocha ice cream, caramel candy, 'Haagse hopjes', candied figs, ground pecan nuts, cold cappuccino.  Rounded onset, quite restrained in sweetness especially for a postmodern coffee stout, hints of dried fig, medlar and fried pear, softish carb, creamy and soft, even somewhat silky mouthfeel.  Pecan-nutty, caramelly and black-toasty maltiness, bittersweet with more bitterness than sweetness, remaining altogether quite dry, with the roasty side enhanced by softly bittering coffee - which does, in the end, provide a strong retronasal aroma highlighted by some warming, gin-like alcohol and a peppery hop bitter note.  Hard caramel- and cappuccino-like aspects linger.  Soft, creamy and drier than expected, this is a somewhat distinct, but in many aspects great coffee stout, though hardly the best stout in Europe...
