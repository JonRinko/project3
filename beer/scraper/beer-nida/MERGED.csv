1,Beamish Irish Stout,5,"Cork, Ireland","""il solito"" al pub che frequento di più era la Beamish. Una birra che non ti stanca mai, leggera di gradazione, dissetante, ne berresti litri!
Ottima stout Irlandese ""caffelattosa"", con schiuma spumosa (spillatura ad azoto).
Per il mio gusto, superiore alla ""sorella"" ben più famosa e diffusa.",flogisto,Cork
2,Simpler Times Pilsner,0.6,"Monrovia, California","Jesus this is bad. Not sure what discriminates this from their lager, taste very similar with harsh grainy notes, corn, acetaldehyde. Light bitterness.",PhillyBeer2112,Monrovia
3,Revolution Fistmas Ale,1.9,"Chicago, Illinois","HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.",cheap,Chicago
4,Samuel Adams Utopias,2,"Boston, Massachusetts","Mildly syrupy, but not overly sweet. Woody and raisiny, if that’s a real word. Not your “traditional beer” taste. Sold by the ounce at Boxelder in Miami. Very interesting to try, worth trying, but personally wouldn’t try it again, not my style.",tryeverything,Boston

9,Lost Abbey Red Poppy Ale,2.3,"San Marcos, California","Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.  Overall: too sour, too little going on, and I'm not convinced the cherries or poppies are doing anything.",frozencemetery,San Marcos
10,Milwaukee's Best Premium,5,"Milwaukee                       , Wisconsin",It's cheap ass hell and it does the job. I get mine at speedway for $1.80 That's including tax!!!,torres,Milwaukee

14,Vox Populi Kettle Sour,0.7,"Montréal, Quebec","Colo amarillo pálido con una ligera neblina. Espuma desmesurada. Aroma a gaseosa y limón. Gusto a cerveza Pale Lager industrial de las baratas mezclada con gaseosa La Casera, notas de polvo y metálicas. Cuerpo acuoso. Esta cerveza es una auténtica estafa, sobrecarbonatada y desagradable, antes de pedirla piensa que una ""clara"" de Steinburg con gaseosa le va a dar 40 vueltas.",Suco,Montréal
15,Brass Castle Very Bad Kitty,1.8,"Malton, North Yorkshire","Can: Gushed as soon as the top was popped, deep black with huge brown head. Aroma was vinegar fruit some roast, very pungent offness. Taste was undrinkable sourness, some molasses. Drain pour, which is unfortunate.",SHIG,Malton

Taste is big bitter obnoxiousness. Nasty, rude ass, totally in yer face. Go figger. Just like any other million IPAs out there except maybe its really hazy. Could not appreciate. Nothing odd about this. It looks OS finally caved to commercialism. This style is so ubiquitous and they all mostly taste the same. I gotta quit buying this happy bullshit style. Its noteven good enough for a tik.",cheap,Grand Haven
24,Knee Deep Oopsie Dhazy,1.6,"Auburn, California","Orange can from chalet.  Not really a hazy IPA but rather clear. First taste is big bitter IPA, whew. Has a muted perfumy IPA nose. Lots of citrus on the tongue. Maybe I can find some hints of guava and passion fruit, but not much. Yes, lots of IPA bitterness, but good co2 for an IPA. Terribly on style, rude crude and nasty.

30,Figueroa Mountain Point Conception,1.6,"Buellton, California","Can from chalet.  Pour is clear and pale. Big white head. Smell is sharp floral IPA and so is the taste. Its terribly on style and it provides a kick. What else can be asked from one of a million ubiquitous, really effin straight up ass, on style  IPA? Go figger. Same as it ever was.

Orange hazy with a frothy head.
Smell of passion fruit, peach and grapefruit with a grainy, milky note, but also this funky rotten fruit note present in some beers of the bigger IPA family. In taste this funky fruit note is even stronger.
Not my kind of beer.",ophone,Escondido

40,New Belgium Voodoo Ranger Starship IPA,1.4,"Fort Collins, Colorado","Tap at bowsers in monaca. I'm so tired of ubiquitous IPA and I'm especially tired of NB revamping the ranger by just slapping a new label on any ubiquitous IPA, quite rude. I'm done ticking these things they always taste the same, my immature taste buds cannot differentiate between these. Anyway, this is just another bitter IPA. Big stupid straight up ass insult to my lager loven taste buds. Whew, rubber chewing on inner tube long bitter finish as well. Just like any other terribly on style IPA, go figger.",cheap,Fort Collins
41,Southern Tier Cinnamon Roll,1.5,"Lakewood, New York","Tap at bowsers, thot I did this one already. A darker brew. Smells like some kind of sweet cinnamon cookies. Taste is flat and bitter with too much of that holiday spice thing going on, comes across as quite rude on the palate. Not good, just too much spices. Seems more like a medicine. Difficult to finish. Good example of a poorly made holiday brew, whew.",cheap,Lakewood
42,Rhinegeist Pure Fury,1.7,"Cincinnati, Ohio",Tap at bowsers. Pale  and it has a mild perfume hop nose. Very bitter up front with lots with lots of green grapefruit rind in there. Mellows out just a bit in the middle. Interesting. Not as bad as I thought it would be if that's any consolation.,cheap,Cincinnati
43,Breckenridge Vanilla Porter,4.8,"Denver, Colorado",A very good Vanilla Porter. I like it just as much as Leinenkugel's Snowdrift. In a tasting they were both hard to tell apart.,LagerChecker34,Denver
44,Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale,1.2,"Chicago, Illinois","Pours headless, malty aroma and grassy spiced fruit finish.

45,Ruddles County (Filtered),1.1,"Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk","500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 09/05/2007.  Crikey, I remember having a bottle of this some years prior, when it still had a peal off top, and don’t remember it being so bad.

Big thick head. Big bitter biting hops from the start, difficult and nastily on style, wheeeeew. Much more medicine than my lager lovin taste buds can handle. So big, so bad, so triple IPA. Thick and viscous on the palate as well as mouth coating like chewing on rude ass partially fermented pine needles ground up into green grapefruit rinds. One big ass kicking imperial experience.

52,Siren Bourbon Aged Primal Cut,1.1,"Finchampstead, Berkshire","Bottle, twice by accident. Oh well... Dark fruit, chocolate, light vanilla, port wine. Unfortunately ridden with nail polish and booze. No body. It is beyond me how such an abomination was not called off from the market. Nail polish mostly. Ugh.",ElDesmadre,Finchampstead
53,Aslin Triple Orange Starfish,2.3,"Herndon, Virginia","16 oz. can, pours an opaque, murky golden yellow with a small white head.

55,Fagnes Quatres Ceréales,1.2,"Mariembourg, Belgium","Bière ambrée de 7,5 % abv, en format 75 cl avec bouchon de liège.
Mon exemplaire était juste à 4 ans après sa date.
Couleur ambré orangé, aux reflets rouquins, et à la clarté pure.
Bulles moyennes, en fontaine centrale, très nombreuses et bien vives.
Mousse blanc cassé, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de pommes cuites, caramel, cookie. Nez très pauvre.
1ère bouche fluide, sur un ensemble peu malté et au goût cerisé !!
Arrière-bouche avec une touche de guimauve.
2ème bouche fruitée, sucrée, très mal assemblée.
Arrière-bouche courte, sans personnalité.
Longueur sur un ensemble très quelconque de bière aux fruits rouges !!
Jambes à gros flocons, courtes.
Levure correcte.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau, il est parti moissonner d'autres céréales.
Finale banale.
CONCLUSION : cette bière est un paradoxe pur, puisqu'en utilisant
4 céréales au brassage, on trouve une bière fruitée et sucrée !!
L'âge ne l'a aucunement aidée, et la texture est très faible …

58,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.5,"La Crosse, Wisconsin","24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/10/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Thin but not too watery finish. Zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nice clean pale malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. Not too overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example.",superspak,La Crosse

Celle-ci est peu persistante. Au nez, c’est évidemment très chocolaté. En bouche. le chocolat prend une énorme place, plus qu’à l’habitude même.

60,Stillwater Gose Gone Hopped,1.7,"Baltimore, Maryland","This is some rough stuff. Definitely not my thing. On the positive side, it's a very pretty beer. Deeply hazy straw yellow with a thick ice cream rocky head that leaves levees of thick lace. The aroma is pretty gross. Lots of cellar must, sea water, rotten grains., lemon, and hops. Flavors are not much better, and along similar lines but with a gym sweat and citrus fade.",freekyp,Baltimore

This thing has a pour which is a somewhat hazy brew but probably not as muddy as a NE IPA should be. Maybe its all settled in the bottom of the can, heheh. Sharp IPA nose. Taste is what else? Its simply perfumy IPA all the way, I made a rhyme, gimmie a dime. At least it doesn't smell like BO or diesel. There, you have it; some kinda of IPA which is right in yer face, terribly on style.

Yes, somebody accidentally left the peels on these green unripened citrus fruits. Nice and hazy on pale is the eye. In the middle it starts to get unruly and sweet as well as perfumy, a little cloying. Yes, coconut and pineapple does not help here.  Yes, this is what seems to be an aged IPA turned into a fruity.

Taste is as expected, heavy on the spices, so much so you may not even be able to tell its a beer, except but maybe perhaps for the warming sensation that follows each slug down the gullet.

87,Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5,"Reno, Nevada","As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Its virtually clear pale and I see its brewed with all kinds of happy bullshit; like apple juice, cinnamon and other fortnight beer additives, so be it, I'll give it a try, heheh. Creamy vanilla colored head. Make no mistake, this is another one of those awful spiced holiday brews, too much spice. Its quite rude but at least it is spiced to cover all its imperfections, just like the rest. You may simply  call it a Christmas  brew, it taste just like the rest; an insult to Christmas.  When are these beer companies going to jump off their high horse and try brewing some plain old good beer? Just asking. Yes, this is simply some way over the top ale, that has way too much spices in it. Get with it DFH, get back to your roots and quit chasing the money making niche of craft beer. You need to make just 12 really good beers. FORGETTAHBOUT all that happy bullshit. Get with it I say. Maybe you better go find some chemical analysis of some mummy's tomb and recreate the beer you think you found in the bottom of the sarcophagus.

113,Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5,"Boortmeerbeek, Belgium","Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.  Overall, this is not enjoyable to drink.  It's harsh, astringent, very bitter, and tastes like eating garden weeds.

128,Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,"Stockport, Greater Manchester","Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back.

159,Natural Light,3.7,"St. Louis, Missouri","This beer has always gotten an undeserved bad rap mostly because it's price lends itself to first time drinkers who abuse it and themselves. Early marketing proclaimed it as the ""beer with the taste for food"". And that is how I discovered it with a friend serving it along with hot wings.  Thirty-five years later it is still a beer you will most frequently find in my fridge. To me it is better than and certainly no worse than Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light. Beers that my neighbors and friends stock their fridges with. You won't see flashy ads on TV for Natty light, but if you think that extra couple of dollars you have to pay for those previously mentioned brands is because of better taste/quality, you would be mistaken. In fact, I did a blind taste test with a group of neighbors a couple of summers ago and Natty Light won with 2 out of 3 of them. Hardly ""scientific"", but evidence that perception/reputation is more powerful than reality.

There are a number of more expensive beers that I also enjoy very much (Sam Adams Summer Ale, Terrapin Hopsecutioner, Harp to name but a few), but you are far more likely to find Natural Light in my fridge on a given weekend and I make no apologies at all for it.

Couleur roux sombre à l'opacité moyenne, et clarté nette.
Bulles fines, en fontaine centrale, à montée lente.
Mousse beige, à fins flocons, stable à 1 mm.
Arômes de compote de prune, cassonade, pointe de cannelle.

Longueur qui n'améliore rien dans la définition.
Jambes huileuses, longues.
Levure basique.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau abv, il laisse faire les choses trannnnquille ...
Finale paresseuse.

183,Propolis Prunus (11/13) ,5,"Port Townsend, Washington","Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.

The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.

Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.",FrothyStave49,Giey-sur-Aujon
199,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Le goût est riche et très équilibré, ce qui fait monter la côte de cette bière dans mon coeur. Cet équilibre se trouve dans l’entremêlement du malt, du houblon et de l’alcool. Cette richesse de gout s’équilibre également par la mousse, dense, qui rend de la douceur a l’ensemble. En arrière de cette équilibre, on retrouve les notes fruitées que l’on sentait au départ. Ce goût et surtout cet équilibre se prolongent tout au long de la dégustation.",FlightLegion58,Giey-sur-Aujon

Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.

A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.",YeastLees62,Giey-sur-Aujon

Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.

En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans.

La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble.

Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.

C’est une blonde tout ce qu’il y a de plus basique. De fines bulles, un parfum de céréales et un goût de malt frais très agréable en bouche. Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer.

La première gorgée attaque par les arômes de céréales, en particulier l’avoine qui surprend. Rien d’étonnant si on a lu l’étiquette et qu’on sait ainsi qu’elle est faite à partir de trois grains, le froment, l’orge et l’avoine donc.

Pours a dark brown color and mahogany highlights with a thick creamy light tan head and great retention.  Spotty lacing.  Very coffee-forward aroma. The taste matches the nose.  Dark roasted coffee and creamer flavors dominate. Any other flavors are drowned out. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation combine for a creamy texture.

Taste is mouth coating veggie hops with decent co2. The co2 is a positive considering how hopped this IPA is. Bitter linger on the sides of the tongue after each big swig. Pretty big impression on the hops, you'd swear its above 5% fer-sher. Why would anybody want to subject their palate to hop bitterness without much alky kick? Just asking.",cheap,Chicago

Aromas of big lemon juice/pulp, lime, citrus peel/zest, wheat, cracker, and white bread dough; with lighter notes of banana, bubblegum, clove, wood, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness.

Lingering notes of tart/tangy citrus juice/pulp/peel/zest, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, banana, bubblegum, clove, wood, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

314,Rogue Farms Marionberry Braggot,5,"Newport, Oregon","Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.

The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.

Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.

Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

429,Firestone Walker Napa Parabola,2.3,"Paso Robles, California","Bottle (2019 vintage). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately malty (chocolate cookie, caramel, roasted grain), with notes of soy sauce, plastic bags, pine sap, and alcohol. Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Extremely disappointing. The aroma is just plain off...soy saucy and plastic-like. Where is the red wine character that I was hoping for (and persuaded to purchase because of)? Alas, it is not evident in this sample. Probably less of the fault of the base beer and just a failure of the barrel to yield its good qualities, instead imparting these icky off notes. Not enjoyable in the mouth either; wayyy too syrupy sweet with little else but harsh alcohol as an attempt to balance...I'd hesitate to even call it drinkable, but it's certainly not enjoyable.

Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  

I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).

465,Category 12 Transmutation Belgian Specialty Ale,4,"Saanichton, British Columbia","Hazy, with a light reddish brown/ amber color to it that has a finger and a half of yellowish soft looking, frothy head that keeps a decent retention to it and leaves clingy, creamy looking curtains of lacing on the glass. 

Pretty decent aroma to it, some sweet, almost over ripe banana and cloves with some subtle hints of pineapples and dried fruit as well. 

Malt forward with a heavily sweet almost, syrupy body to it with solid fruit flavors present, some dried stone fruits, apricots, apples and cherries with some faint hints of whiskey and vanilla notes. Heavy bodied, thick, full bodied and potent like a barley wine with a sweet toffee and butterscotch malt flavor. 

Finish is strong, boozy and sweet but with a slightly woody coniferous hop note that increases in bitterness as it warms, though due to the heavy bodied sweetness it sticks to the background, but does add a bit of balance to the beer to keep it from being completely over sweet. Back-end has some strong aromatic Belgian esters with notes of banana chips, cloves, black pepper, musty coriander and pineapple that hang out on the palate along with some warming boozy ethyl volatiles that linger with the sweetness on the aftertaste.",WortStein17,Saanichton

479,O'Shea's Traditional Irish Stout,1,"Atherstone, Warwickshire","Review: 50cl brown bottle of O’Shea’s Irish Stout: 4.5% vol.

Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!

Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” 

On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. 

Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.

The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.

On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.

In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. 

Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.

Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!

It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. 
Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….",Drinking_77,Atherstone

There’s fruitiness, but I could really place it as passionfruit... it’s horrible amount of wet rye bread, fennel, coriander and god knows what.

Taste is candied watermelon, with a Woodchuck-like aftertaste that is sort of like added distillate & sugars. Malic acid tartness. Watermelon juice here, cider is dirty. Crispy, slightly thick feel. Sulfite headache.

Not good. Swore I've rated this brand before & knew better.",MicroGrog,Austin

Big giant swig directly form can sends a rubbery viscous hop palate skyward. Rude, bitter after taste; think about this:     ......      chewing on green-ass grapefruit peels, nasty nellie-ship. Yes, its still all over the table and as I drink to the middle of the can I don't give a shit. Better go git a paper towel so I can redd this mess up, with a buggy and warsh cloth.

Arrière-bouche stylée, nette, à la définition pure.
Longueur à la texture trop pétillante, et qui ne trouve plus de nuances très nobles.

Of course, its a given that I'm not crazy about pumpkin beers to begin with, but I can still usually drink them. This one, though, was a drainpour. Something about the taste of a baked pumpkin with a very pronounced bitterness over a semi-dry malt just doesn't work - at all. My wife even said it smelled horrible as I poured it out and she complained she'd have to clean the sink. I didn't really spend too much time analyzing this, so I don't have a ton more depth to provide. Two sips was enough to convince me to dump it.

The flavor is sweet with the grain flavor coming through before giving way to a delicious almost toasted coconut coconut flavor before finishing with a slight hoppy bitterness to offset the sweetness of the grains and coconut  it also finishes with more coconut.

Rich, malty with notes of sewer rat.  Quite similar to a Newcastle that had gone warm and had homeless bathe in it for a few weeks.  Carbonation was apparent but did little to improve the drinkability of this thick drunk nectar.  A few sips in the taste started to improve.  No longer could taste the homeless who chose to cleanse themselves and get inebriated at the same time.  By the time I finished the first, it reminded me much more of a crisp coors original.  By this time the tape around both my hands was slowly cutting off circulation so drinking these rockets of awesomesauce helped ease the pain.

Crystal clear coloured body with a thick, three centimetre tall off-white head, a bit tan and quite soapy throughout. Aroma of grass, hay, light metal, some funk and cardboardie malt and a dash of peppery hops on the end. Light-bodied; Very strong pungent lager yeast flavours up front with biscuits, crackers and grain very strong with some light lemons and pungent grass throughout that leaves this quite astringent on the end. Aftertaste is very deep and bitter - mainly from the grassy malts and the lager yeast - these are very strong and don't go away at all. Overall, a fairly strong pilsener that is very typical for an American beer, just sadly, from Macro-producers; This doesn't taste like a craft beer at all - it could be from SABMiller or In-Bev and you wouldn't even know at all. This one definitely isn't worth trying at all, especially as one that is somehow deemed to be 'respectable' by others.

2015 - tried it and it was ok, LOTS of hops (in an Octoberfest which is KNOWN for its malt???)

2017 - 150 lbs of hops in each bottle, even tho' Ofests are to be malty.  Too much hops and NO FLAVOR.
2018 - same thing - HOPSHOPSHOPSHOPS.  decent, but horribly wrong.
2019 - last chance SN, can you learn that Ofest is a malty beer???

Nope.  2019 is ALL HOPS, an orange - YES ORANGE - color (their catering to the pumpkin goofs??) and a weak aroma and head.  The taste is sharp, like hot sauce, and has NO MALT AT ALL.  All the reviewers who say it is ""malty"" are using their HOPS-favoring tongue.  IT IS NOT MALTY AT ALL.  I will never buy SN again.  Wow.

931,Samuel Adams Sam '76,1,"Boston, Massachusetts","This was part of a sample pack that I picked up at the grocery store. I had seen favorable reviews of this beer, and was looking forward to trying it. Sadly, it’s not what I expected. Upon deeper examination, it might be one of the hops that doesn’t work for me. I’ve never liked Mozaic. 

The beer pours a straw to golden color, with a thin white head. The color is a little hazy. But I’m a homebrewer, so a little haze doesn’t bother me (we are talking about an ale, right?). 

The aroma is where I first notice the Mozaic hops. Very dank, and not pleasant at all. Like a cat’s litter box. 

Taste isn’t any better. Not bad, if I drink it fast enough. If I try to enjoy it, the whole litter box sensation comes back and I’m like, “Why do I keep doing this to myself?”

I once had a six pack of another ale featuring Mozaic hops. And I found that if I forgot about it in the basement for about six months, the dank had faded and I was left with something drinkable. I think I’ll do the same with the remainders from this sample pack.

G-Had was originally synthesised by the US army during Vietnam but was immediately banned by the international community as a biological weapon of mass destruction. Today, Galahad is only manufactured by failed states as its production is a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This substance has a half life and you can feel it decaying inside you.

1046,Delirium Red,5,"Melle, Belgium","Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Delirium Red is a Belgian ale with cherry and elderberries crafted by Brouwerij Huyghe.

The fragrance of elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is purple that pours a low pinkish white head. When held up to light, the beer glows maroon and reveals sediment. The alcohol content is 8%.

Elderberries are juicy and textures the mouthfeel. Cherries compliments the elderberries while moderately tarting the complexion. Belgian yeast softens the body and draws out the figs used. Biscuit malt blends and flavors the yeasty profile. Plums are easily distinguished during the finish as an almond touch fluoresces the finish. Black licorice spices the take and bitters the comprehension.

Delirium Red is an enticing Belgian ale. The elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt, and figs make this Belgian a one of a kind. This is a sweet beer. However, the Belgian yeast and almonds tones it down, yet the elderberries and cherries still perpetuate. The plum and almond finish is my favorite aspect to this beer. I loved drinking this libation and enraptured by its complexity. I highly recommend trying it. Cold, you will face the sweetness head on. In my opinion, serving it between cold and room temperature is optimal. Be careful as you pour to leave behind sediment.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1183,Lagunitas Newcastle Brown Ale (US version),0.5,"Petaluma, California","""Brewed and bottled (and seen a man about a dog at Lagunitas)."" This pathetic attempt at grasping at whatever was left of the north-of-England roots (which, going by the taste and aroma is absolutely nothing) is the slogan that now aptly befits this swill. 

To me, Newcastle always stood out as accessible, yet quality brown ale. Low on hops, mellow -- just want you'd expect. I was suspicious when I tried  the Holland brew but found it pretty much the same as the old english one.

I had no idea that they were now producing it in the US and had completely changed the formula. There's some quality accessible US-made ale out there, like Bass ale, but this tasteless, bitter stuff that's in front of me right now is a failure on every corner. And a shame, too. Goes to show how little tradition and consistent commitment to quality matter these days and how blind corporate greed corrupts everything it touches, parasitically, destroying even itself in the end.

I guess some politically correct bastard thought it politically incorrect and removed it before the labels went to print, heheh. Slightly below room temperature this stuff smells like mild laid back hops with a citrus tinge. Head is real big, almost all the glass. I almost spilled it over with just a few ounces. Slightly hazy pale yellow orange. Pretty good sizzle on the palate, co2 is doing its job. Can't really taste the mango in it, its mostly typical ubiquitous bitter IPA. Like IPA? As if you don't already know a million of them? Here, you go then, add this one to your list. Aftertaste is weird alky - dull fruit, if that's what you want to call it; perhaps that's where the mango comes kicking in, who knows? Terribly on style, almost astringent at times.

1190,Garage (CA) Cold Brew Coffee Milk Stout,1.7,"Temecula, California","Very thin mouthfeel and lighter side of color for the category. Good aroma but taste is lacking. The biggest issue with taste is the carbonation being soda-like and causing bitterness. Seems to be a common problem among lower quality stouts from micro-brewers who don't primarily brew stouts. This is a huge problem for this category that is not hard to change but would make a huge difference. If you're listening, please don't skimp on using nitro to save on costs. I understand the business aspect but the cost to reputation is much higher. Though IPAs are all the rage now, stouts may later become a trend just as big. And for good reason. But that reason for becoming a stout fan is the thick creamy smooth and very aromatic flavor and smell of a well-aged barrel nitro imperial russian stout. Not this thin concoction meant to keep the price range equivalent to an IPA or ale.

This may be one of those beers that really is best drunk cold. Very cold. The flavours are building up in my mouth kinda like petrol fumes. Spicy, phenolic, smoke, bandaid, TCP, plastic, peanut skin, raw potato. Gawd! I think I've had enough now. The interesting is starting to turn into unpleasant and difficult to drink much more. Yes. Enough. Stop. This is the sort of beer that drunk cold in small samples would remain interesting and intriguing, but drunk as a proper drinking beer - a full can at room temperature, it becomes a chore to the point of torture.",SilkTork,Aspen
1194,Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA,1.9,"Eugene, Oregon",Very disappointing.  Too malty for my expectation of a double IPA. Taste was chocolate malt a little coffee more like a porter.

It is actually a very decent brew that offers one an opportunity to enjoy how real beer is made before state/federal regulations get to it and water down the flavor.
And to the idiot (lehers) that thinks that it tastes like coors light but with more alcohol - I strongly suggest you not only seek professional help to check your taste buds, but also stop drinking beer altogether.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is medium yellow.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, very unclean.

Medium to full body, syrupy/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The aroma is fairly meek, and composed almost entirely of off notes...if it was only stronger, it might score a 1 for aroma. Very dirty aftertaste as well, unsurprisingly. Honestly the only nice thing about it is the lasting head...everything else is just plain repulsive.",Ernest,Petaluma

Smells more like a salsa than anything else.  If it was called salsa beer then I would have been ready for that.  After reading the can I then discovered that this Clamato, is that clam and tomato? yuck!  Oh and picante is in it.  There is where the salsa smell is from.

The looks of the beer are alright. Golden yellow colour, clear beer and very rough white head. Foam retention is almost non-existent. It looks a bit watery. It also ain't bubbling a lot. 
The aroma of the beer is soo-soo. Some simple rough malts that are a bit bready and some dry hop aromas. Grassy, piney and a bit zesty and fruity. But, not too strong. It all is a bit like a malt lemonade with some hop aromas dropped into it. It misses some of the soul of a beer.
The taste of the beer is okay. Bitter hops, sweet malts. Thats it. A bit rough and definitely simple. Not to unbalanced. But I expected a bit more. 
The palate of the beer is weak. Thin texture, light body and light carbonation. The finish is watery and short. It has some malts and some bitter hops. All in all, there are some essences of a Pale Ale in this beer. But, it misses soul, balance and yeast and alcohol. When do people start to realise beer just can't be made without alcohol. The yeast and alcohol are important parts of the aroma bouquet of a beer. It is the most important aspect of many beers.

1241,Hacker-Pschorr Sternweisse,1.6,"Munich, Bavaria","Die Biere von Hacker-Pschorr werden bereits seit 1998 bei Paulaner produziert.
Hab ich in den letzten 4 Jahren mehrfach verkostet und war das schlechteste Weissbier, das ich jemals verkostet habe (und ich habe über 100 bewertet). Hab ich noch nie erlebt, aber meine Körperchemie war nicht mit diesem Bier kompatibel. Konnte es einfach nicht glauben. Bei 4 von 6 Verkostungen waren ein tauber Mund (selbst die Lippen) und ein rauer Hals die Folge. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich mich gerade vergiftet habe. Irre. Ich kann es nicht erklären, da dies nur bei diesem Bier jemals der Fall war.
Bei der aktuellen Verkostung (Sommer 2019) passierte dies nicht und ich erlaube mir deshalb eine möglichst objektive (wenn auch nicht positive) Bewertung. 
Sehr viel Hefe, die da durchs Glas wabert. Find ich gut. Süß, malziger Geruch, nicht sehr lecker. Auch geschmacklich ist dies vorherrschend. Nicht sehr süffig. Wird ab dem Mittelteil dann sogar gallig / bitter, sehr unangenehm trocken, kratzig und dumpf. Bäh. Dass das harte Münchner Wasser in Verbindung mit viel Hopfen ein ""kratziges"" Mundgefühl erzeugt, ist ein Problem, dass seit Jahrhunderten bekannt ist - und das andere Brauereien aus der ""Hauptstadt mit Herz"" trotzdem irgendwie besser gebacken bekommen. Schade, dass das normale dunkle Weizen von Hacker-Pschorr inzwischen offenbar eingestellt wurde und es als Alternative nur noch die Sternweisse gibt.

Mousse brun moyen, à gros flocons, pâteuse, stable à 5 mm.

It is as  if they brewed a lager and added dark food coloring, that is how this tastes.  There is no genuine malt presence.  It is dark in your glass, but not in taste.  The finish has no ""bread"".

I actually don't mind Bud Light Lime for making Micheladas at home, because it doesn't come across as sweet; just fizzy yellow American beer with a lime in it.

1288,Rogue Kulture Clash,5,"Newport, Oregon","Acquired at Smart Time Food for $15.99, Kulture Clash is an Imperial Blonde Ale blended with kombucha tea crafted in collaboration between Brew Dr. Kombucha and Rogue Ales.

The aroma of kombucha, pear, lemon, and herbal notes are sensed as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.9%.

The kombucha tea is watery and makes the beer easy to drink. The tea aspect gives a domineering pear sensation. Cherries slightly tarts the complexion along with sweetening the tone. Ginger spices the take and lingers into the dry finish. Clove illuminates the pear timbre. Lemon compliments the pear and cherry flavors. Wheat fairly textures the mouthfeel.

Kulture Clash is an amazing Imperial Blonde blended with kombucha tea. The kombucha used delivers an impeccable experience despite this beer coming across as a kombucha instead of a beer. The cherry and ginger are a beautiful compliment to the lemon and pear. As a final product, I think it is an outstanding. This is exciting to drink that will leave an impression upon you.

 Spartan is one of Bavaria’s core beers bound by their purity laws. This makes it so excellent. A clear golden pour, crisp refreshing and date that slips down so smoothly. And a finish that plays your spine like a xylophone! Delicious

I'm not even a big hops guy, I enjoy a mild amount but the Fat Tug just has too much hops at first followed by too strong of a malt aftertaste.

With a bit of time out of the bottle it really does start to smell like a PB&J. The intense peanuty note is probably the highlight of this brew. Taste is bittersweet, full of earthy peanut shell and sweet artificial cough drop. Body is medium, carbonation moderate, texture watery.

An excellent gem from the East Coast shows that Allagash is still on top of their game when it comes to balancing tartness with depth. It might not be my favorite release yet just thinking about it makes me wish that I had a glass to sip right now.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vinegary plums, raspberry, and a sharp abrasive profile gnaw at the nose. The vanilla head rests over a bed of caramel as the lean base swirls freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cherry and Sour Patch Kids imbued with raspberry cling to the senses as the vinegar works it way into every corner of the throat. A rich finish of freshly picked strawberries polish off an excellent experience. I would happily drink this again if I came across a tap line.",Brigadier,Portland

J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur.

1550,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,4.1,"Chico, California","12 oz. bottle from a six-pack brought back from Raley's in Chico, CA.  The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!",J_man,Chico

1558,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!",saltyseadog,Grand Rapids

Tastes of sweet bourbon whiskey, roasty, chocolate, molasses, and oak, with notes of vanilla and caramel and maybe even some char. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation.

1590,Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout,4,"Denver, Colorado","Imperial stout de 9,5 % abv et 75 ebu, en format 35,5 cl.
A noter qu'il est toujours très agréable de rencontrer le yéti en février,
surtout quand les températures du jour et du lieu avoisinaient les 24° C.
Mon exemplaire, de Denver, Colorado, était à 9 mois avant sa date.
Couleur noir profond aux reflets marron grillé, à l'opacité très forte.
Mousse brun roux foncé, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de cèdre, baies noires macérées en péket, chêne liège brûlé.
1ère bouche très souple, sur un bois brûlé de la plus belle manière …
(si l'on peut dire, et sans être un pyromane ...)
Arrière-bouche avec une impression de strong dry stout.
2ème bouche avec café serré, poivre, muscade, tabac brun.
Arrière-bouche qui entre dans la complexité, avec une allégresse vive.
Longueur qui trouve pas mal de zestes dans ce café taillé au couteau ..
Jambes très huileuses, limite grasses, très longues.
Levure boisée, vernissée, belle ligne.
Alcool fort, plus haut que son niveau, il fait un 10,5 % tranquille,
mais il se révèle un peu emprisonné sur la longueur …
Il ne peut trouver d'autres issues aux saveurs, juste un peu ""coincées"".
Finale intéressante, sans problème, mais oh combien discutable ..
CONCLUSION : le yéti est un personnage séduisant (de loin ..), mais
incontestablement excessif, dans tous les sens du terme, et donc si
on est un biérophile averti, on ne va pas lui trouver de 5 à la cote, 
malgré les pages qui en sont remplies … Yéti soit qui mal y pense !!
Moralité : grande division (divide) sur la présence de ce yéti .. à 24° C.
(à noter aussi qu'il n'a reçu que des médailles d'argent et de bronze ...)
(à noter enfin qu'il est conseillé avec du steak grillé .. on a compris !!)

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Sadly this suffers from one of SN's oldest problems...too much raw vitamin B yeast odor. The hop aroma is simple, but it's quietly pleasant I suppose.

1764,Cloudwater / Salt Proper,4.2,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","440ml can brewed in England at 6.2%. Near-black pour, black in the glass. Brown head, decent size, OK duration. Low carbonation. Slight but deep stout aroma, hints of wood. Taste follows, with a particular dry, roasted finish. Very nice stout, and at least going by the label, its flavour is accomplished without actual additions of coffee or cacao - always a plus, especially from a talented organisation like Cloudwater, who really ought to be able to make a killer stout with minimal to no additions. Then again, I just don't know how much of this beer is down to them and how much to Salt. The label is a bit flowery, but ""toasted teacake base"" does describe the malt here quite well - at least the none-roast elements. This is a stouty stout, and a good example of what a stout can be that a porter can not - any chocolate flavour here is minimal, and very much on the dark side, and the roast flavour overpowers any out-and-out coffee elements. Sweetness is there, but appears to emanate from the beer, so to speak. The dry, almost ashy finish is the key note of this beer, and quite a welcome taste. Good flavour for the ABV - I wish Cloudwater would add a good stout or two to their core range some time, as they clearly have the ability to make a strong contender in the style if they put their mind to it. Something like this would fit the bill, along with perhaps an Imperial. Just saying!",LagerGuide122,Manchester

Medium to barely Full-bodied; Strong rich malt notes that shows the roasted malt, a bunch of coffee and earth with a touch of peanuts and cashew flavours show through with a lot of alcohol and boozy qualities and a rich sweetness finishes it off nicely. Aftertaste shows the deep cognac and scotch notes with a lot of alcohol pungency, but the earth, coffee, lactose and cream notes somehow shine through even stronger, with a lot of anise and licorice bitterness still around and some softer sugars at the tail end make this somewhat balanced, but still strong, and perhaps a touch thin. Overall, a rich and earthy beer with a ton of boozy warmth throughout with a lot of the cognac and whiskey notes that can't be hidden, but the anise and fennel flavours are strong as well, and the two years haven't tempered it or made it mellow, and this is quite strong and pungent throughout. Overall, a deeper and more pungent beer than I expected, especially after a few years in the bottle, with a deep robust punch from the malt and alcohol with a lot of boozy flaovurs and anise notes with a touch of vanilla. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 28-December-2017 for US$4,49 sampled at home in Washington, just over two years later on 27-January-2020.",jgb9348,San Diego

2177,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,3.8,"Chico, California","6-Pack of 12 ounce bottles - $10.99 at Publix in Marietta, Georgia.

PKGD 12/16/19.

Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy, golden-amber body with a medium-small, whitish head.

Smell: A little caramel and honey-brushed biscuit, subtly bready with restrained citrus, florals, pine and black peppercorn.

Taste: Modestly sweet, bready and biscuity with a light flourish of honey, blonde caramel. Citusy, light pine. Peppery, a teensy bit earthy, some rustic woodsiness. Citrus quality picks up a little lime on the tailend, particularly as it warmed. Medium bitterness. A final lick of orange blossom honey before the gently drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp yet displays a scant oily texture.

Overall: 40th feels like a beer someone would've tried to slap the Extra Pale Ale moniker onto. Nothing too terribly groundbreaking or over-the-top whimsical. I, myself will be turning forty this year and neither need nor expect much fanfare or ribaldry, content to just keep sailing along.",ChainGangGuy,Chico

2205,Unibroue Trois Pistoles,5,"Chambly, Quebec","Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.

The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.

Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.

Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

2206,De Dolle Stille Nacht,4.5,"Diksmuide, Belgium","Less than 16 week old bottle, from Bier Huis, Ossett. Hazed, medium gold. Some fine floaters. Fine ring of white head. Wasn’t having a beer for a week, supposedly, but got a flyer from work, and did this with some crumpets and Alpha Toma cheese. I don’t know sometimes, but words can’t do justice. This is a beer I haven’t had since pre RB days, and I remember it standing out back then as something unique and exciting. It’s just a warming, ridiculously smooth and tasty, bittersweet glass of gorgeousness.",Garrold,Diksmuide

W smaku piwo jest pełne i wyraźnie słodkie. Płynny pumpernikiel przejmuje władanie. Dopiero po chwili dochodzą nuty melasy, kawy zbożowej, niuanse spalonej skórki chleba, susz owocowy.

2209,Peak Organic Fresh Cut Pilsner,4.7,"Portland, Maine","Portland, Maine, poured from a can.  Clean, pure, effervescent sensations from start to finish.  My current favorite afternoon beer.  ABV is 4.6%, about the same as Founder's All-Day IPA, which I would consider to be this beer's cousin in the ale family.  I'm not sure what qualifies this as a pilsner as opposed to a session IPL.  Whatever it is, as a bitter and hoppy lager, I think this is excellent.  It has fruity, juicy front notes and a long citrus-rind finish.",benhem,Portland

Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. The dark fruits are more prominent on the taste, especially on the arrival, which then give way to milk chocolate. The finish is a flourish of roasted malts and a coffee bitterness. The bottle describes the beer as ""dark, rich and sexy"" and I can't find any reason to argue with that.

Pas de quoi se passionner pour un amateur de bière, et la question de se poser s'il n'est tout de même pas possible d'offrir mieux pour avoir une première approche de la bière à certains segments marketing (car il ne faut pas se le cacher nous touchons ici au marketing). Il est certain qu'ici, une touche d'acidité pour donner du pep's aurait été appréciable, tout comme un sucre un peu moins présent (mais ici tout est fait pour cacher l'alcool, car nous sommes tout de même chez les jeunes dans un paradoxe il faut boire de l'alcool, mais sans se rendre compte que c'est de l’alcool !). Sur la bière en elles même je n'ai malheureusement pas grand-chose à dire, le visuel est sur un rosé foncé sans mousse. Le nez est sur un mélange entre le vin rosé et grenadine et c'est d'ailleurs le duo que l'on retrouve de l'attaque au final en passant par l'arrière bouche avec tout de même un brin d'épices. C'est linéaire, poussif, avec un alcool à 9,2 % que l'on cache. Si la corpulence est honnête, la longueur est courte.

Aftertaste is dry with a lot of herbal and grassy notes and a touch of the citrusey characteristic from the European hops. Overall, a nice and floral, grassy and fresh-flavoured light lager that has a good deal of malt-based flavours that shows some perfume, but almost no sweetness at all throughout the beer aside from some mellow caster sugar notes way up front.

Hazy and pale. Citrussy pale malts aroma. Very oxidised taste. Fruity fleshy taste. Dead, apart from some fizziness. Heavy peachy melony in the mouth and in the finish.

2281,Anchor Porter,3.2,"San Francisco, California","330ml bottle from Drinkers Paradise in Kentish Town for £2.50. Served at cool room temperature into a tumbler. The date code on the back label had worn slightly, all I could make out was 2020. 

The beer pours an almost jet black colour, with a thick look. A one and a half finger muscovado colour head generates. Loose looking and quick to dissipate away. 

The first aroma to strike is overwhelming liquorice. This also dominates the first gulps on taste. However, it soon does away to leave light aromas of dark dried fruits, raisins. Roasted malt is also prevalent.

As aforementioned, liquorice dominates the early exchanges before fading away. Dark dried fruit, roasted malt and limited espresso then take the fore. I found the taste a little overbearing, too much going on for my tastebuds. 

The drink leaves the mouth feeling just slightly dry. The taste of the malt and dark fruit do linger like a strong coffee for some time in the mouth. Pleasant.

Overall, I got a mixed level of enjoyment from this beer. The flavours just didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Well made but not something I’d seek out again.",PubTun33,San Francisco

2286,Stone Enjoy By IPA - Unfiltered,3.7,"Escondido, California","Quite hazy deep golden and orange coloured body with a very soapy and quite tall, off-white head, about four centimetres tall that stays afloat for a long time. Aroma of alcohol, crisp grassy, citrusey and very herbal hopswith a lot of alpha acids, quite a bit of sweetness from fruits and a lot of malt as a good backbone. Medium-bodied; Rich deep flavour of alcohol, strong citrus, a lot of dry grassy and herbal flavours and showing almost a perfect balance of significant hops and associated bitterness with a lot of malt - mostly dry and grassy, with a nice layer of sweet and astringency from the alcohol and residual sugars. Aftertaste shows all the flavours melded into one consistent package, which has the right balance and potency - the hops hit strong, the malt is supportive and the complexity is nice, especially for the style. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA which shows some classy notes and a complex, dry and bitter West Coast IPA vibe that actually make this worth drinking/finding from Stone (a surprise, actually!), even a few days past the 'due date'. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Whole Foods in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia on 18-December-2019 for US$2,99 sampled a bit less than a month later on 14-January-2020 at my house in Washington a few blocks away.",jgb9348,Escondido
2287,Lancaster Double Chocolate Milk Stout,3.7,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania","Super deep dark brown coloured body with a thinnish, very fast-dying tan and off-white head. Aroma of alcohol, roasted malt, bunches of vanilla pods, anise, a dose of caramelised sugars and a heavy strong molasses and lactose note - very nice. Medium-bodied; Strong rich malty and milk-based/cream flavours dominate at first with bunches of roasted malt, anise and deeper flavours that have a lot of bitterness, but also a bunch of sweetness that all end with a strong alcohol bite, but tempered by the grain and the sugars, which are quite pervasive. Medium to almost Full-bodied; Strong rich grainy and oatmeal flavours dominate with mostly malt up front, but the molasses and caramelised sugar flavours dominate soon afterwards and lead into the more sweet flavours of vanilla and of course - loads of chocolate with a light bitterness from coffee at the end. Aftertaste shows a dense creamy, lactose and milky finish with a lot of body and a good deal of balancing sugars in the form of raisins and chocolate. Overall, a very nice milk stout that shows some deeper characteristics, while being fairly easy-to-drink and very smooth around the edges, even for being a very fresh beer!

2300,Cloudwater Light Lager (S•S19),3.8,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","Pours a clear, golden coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of doughy, slighty grainy malt and quite floral hops, with just a hint of herbal, citrus accents. Taste is a good balance of sweet'ish doughy, slightly grainy malt and quite floral, slightly herbal hops, with some hay and lime peel coming through as well. Finishes quite crisp, with a very light bitterness and some floral hops and lime peel lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.

While this is pretty good for a light lager, with a great balance of sweet malts and floral, slightly herbal citrus hops, it still is what it is, with a pretty light body and flavor profile. Crisp and semi-dry, with a light bitterness, this is sure is easy-drinking and refreshing, but still seriously lacking in flavor. I've done my best to rate this to style, but I'm not sure just how far you can take this style. I mean, sure, it's a lot better than Coors Light, but what does that really say?

2313,Westmalle Tripel,4.2,"Malle, Belgium","May 28, 2019 bottling date.
BB May 28, 2021

Taken from a 44°F fridge, pour begins after ~5+ min.

Aroma is banana, spices, floral, sweet malts.

Color is gold, slightly hazy, plenty of rising bubbles to a 1/2 inch white, thick, and creamy-appearing head from a fairly gentle pour, which quickly falls to a 1/4 inch thick creamy cap.

Taste is spicey backed by the fruit tastes - banana, perhaps other indistinct (apple, maybe), with a solid sweet-ish floral backing. The spiciness is very peppery, and the banana and apple(?) carry throughout.  The floral breadiness adds a lift to the taste that is quite nice. Little alcohol present in the taste, but you can definitely feel it about half way through.  Only a very slight bitterness in the beginning that is pretty much gone by the middle. The finish is sticky and semi-sweet.

Medium feel, tilting to the thin side, but the primary feel is the carbonation tingling counteracting the creamy smoothness.

Overall, dangerously too easy to drink quickly given the ABV; I needed to consciously slow down, because I found it too enjoyable; I just wanted to just sip, sip, and sip again. An excellent tripel.

Nearly black from the front, dark ruby with a backlight.  Tall, thick, khaki head, creamy, with good retention. As it recedes, the top is cratered and bubbly, leaving good looking thick strings of lacing down the glass. Ample rising bubbles visible.

Taste is roasted coffee/malts, and as with the aroma, hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Mild bitterness shows up in the middle and carries through to the finish and aftertaste.  The finish is semi-dry with the mild hops bitterness providing excellent balance to the dark malts. This lingers into the aftertaste.

The body has some heft for the style, but objectively medium bodied tending toward the thin side.  The mouth feel is somewhat dry with good carbonation sparkling.

Overall, an excellent Robust Porter. To my taste, in the same class as the Founders, only slightly better in the strength of the aroma and taste.",MNAle,Comstock

The nose has coffee to the fore, but plenty of citrus in the background.  The initial taste is sharpness, bitter like lettuce base.  But there is also coffee and chocolate with burnt toast hints.  The finish is bitter black coffee, and alcoholic warmth in the stomach.  Excellent !

Taste is stellar with previously mentioned aromatic notes along with a base of leathery chew, tobacco, light bitterness from hops and great carbonation.  Creamy mouthfeel. Pitch perfect.

2370,Timothy Taylor's Landlord (Bottle),4.4,"Keighley, West Yorkshire","500ml bottle brewed in England at 4.1%. Crystal-clear copper colour. Nice-sized fair-duration head. Aroma of sweet brown bread malt and tangerine citrus. Moderate- carbonation. Surprisingly dark toasty malt, mingling with gentle but tangible tangerine citrus, touching base on their respective bitter ends. Really nicely balanced, and surprisingly thick and full of flavour (if fairly straightforward), never mind for the ABV. The care taken and quality of ingredients also come across, partly in the yeast character (surprisingly discernible for so clear a beer) but especially the water - this beer is approximately 95% water, and the imparted character from the unique source is quite noticeable and well-received! A living legend, not much better out there now for a pub drink, and if it's overrated it's only in the same way the Beatles were. Don't go into this expecting an all-singing all-dancing craft-style experience, this is an old school best-of-class, and lives up to its reputation. Also damned inexpensive to pick a few bottles up, another thing to be thankful for. A smooth luxurious 'session' ale, perfect pub fare, exuding quality - but if there's anything to take away from this beer it's how inoffensive it is. Part of the reason this is so many people's favourite ales is how it just doesn't put a foot wrong; not everyone has it as their favourite tipple, but how many have a bad word to say about it? Exactly.",LagerGuide122,Keighley

2435,Prairie Christmas Bomb! - Barrel Aged,4.1,"Tulsa, Oklahoma","Millésime 2017   
Apparence : Noire, col et carbonatation absents (bière de deux ans tout de même).    
Nez :  Chocolat noir, malt grillé, fut, aspect épicé sans que celles-ci soient clairement indentifiables.  
Goût : L'entrée est marquée par les mêmes arômes qu'au nez puis, on a une transition vers une finale plus pimentée et quelque peu plus torréfiée. Si l'entrée est plus sur les notes sucrées du chocolat et du malt, la finale se veut plus épicée et amère, bien que ce soit contrôlé.   
Sensation : Corps moyen-plus, fort chaleureuse, aspect pimenté en bouche, bonne longueur.   
Bref : Belle diversité des arômes dans ce stout aux notes sucrées non négligeables, mais ne tombant pas dans la catégorie des bières desserts qu'on rencontre de plus en plus. Comme je pouvais m'en attendre et comme Prairie m'en a habitué jusqu'à présent, une Stout qui réconforte, qui satisfait et qui gagne à être partagée malgré le petit format.

От дуппель бока нету тоже почти не следа, только легкая карамельная нотка которая полностью поглощена солодом и копченостью.

2480,Founders Centennial IPA,3.8,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","Bottle; supermarket in Copenhagen.

Pours a cloudy, deep golden with a touch of red. Frothy head - the foam sticks nicely. Inviting rose and hops scent. Taste is initially fresh, spicy hops accompanied by a floral, slightly fruity, kick. Then it turns more grassy and... mineral-y, almost like pine. 

It's intoxicating, and not just literally (although the presence of ethanol is clear as the hoppy bitterness fades). 

A product worthy of marking a centennial celebration (assuming this was its purpose).

Aroma is spice forward with lots of coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise and allspice. Light dark roast notes with toasted bread and a light nuttiness.

Flavor is somewhat sweet with light roast, chocolate and toasted bread notes. Moderate bitterness and light alcohol spice. So much spice though. Tons of coriander, clove, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low,but present alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this isn't good at all. It has way too much spice and is what I assume licking a spice cabinet would taste like. I find these undrinkable and I can usually drink most beers.",ineedbeer,Placentia

The beer pours a dark burnt orange colour. No real head generates but carbonation is visible through the clear liquid. 

The aroma feels very standard of the style. Caramel malts, light citrus hop. Beery, as my other half would say. 

The taste follows the aroma. Crisp, clean with a low slight bitterness. Citrus, low caramel, low biscuit. 

A medium level of carbonation on the tongue. A balanced but short lived aftertaste.

Citrus & grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine & subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too.

Bringing it closer revealed grapefruit and peach predominantly. The taste was quite sour at first, which was a little surprising.

Taste is somewhat bitter in the beginning, and this remains in the background throughout. Dark fruits, raisins, mild spiciness.  The taste is fairly complex, with the interplay of fruit, spice, and a dry bitterness that borders on astringency. The bitterness is more like bitter coffee (albeit with no coffee taste) rather than bitter hops. The finish is surprisingly toward dry, given the sweetness of the aroma.

Feel is smooth and a bit thin.

Deep dark brown, almost touching black. A small finger and a half tan head. Dissipates quickly. 

The aroma is heavily malt driven, molasses, caramel, confectioners sugar and dark dried fruit. Some limited apple. 

The taste is sweet and heavily malty. Dark fruit and molasses. Easily drinkable, similar to a English strong ale. Fruit cake-like. Flavour balance not present but does not diminish the enjoyment.

Sweet in the mouth. Lingering malty, molasses tastes. An unexpected amount of carbonation that is fairly lively. 

Overall, from the small haul of holiday ales I got this festive season, this one is my favourite but also the simplest. A very good beer.

Taste is deep syrupy coffee liqueur in a good way, maple is helping to smooth and balance everything out. Mouthfeel is  smooth and chewy, warming, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I'm not sure how it could get better than this. Nonetheless this is very good, heavy but extremely balanced.

1/2 inch thick, creamy white head with decent retention, leaving thick lacing and a pitted surface as it drops. Color is clear deep amber with ample rising bubbles.

Initial feel is thick (for an APA) and smooth, which remains pretty much throughout until it is overcome by a bitter middle and finish.

Initial taste repeats the citrus from the aroma, with a substantial malt sweetness behind.  The middle becomes more piney and bitter, but the bitterness is always controlled by the balancing sweet malts. Aftertaste is piney and moderately bitter. The finish is tending toward dry, but enough sweetness remains that it never actually gets there. 

Overall, this is an excellent APA. Hoppy, but well-balanced and delicious.

Light-bodied; Strong grassy and herbal flavours dominate with a lot of dry malts and some subtle hops along with a touch of sweetness and a clean, very easy-drinking yeast bite towards the end that showcases the malts as well.

Overall, a pretty understated and soft beer, and even though that's what you'd expect from the style, I was thinking that from the brewery you'd get a bit more character and depth, but that isn't the case here - this is easy drinking and a pure Pils without any real class.

2822,Toppling Goliath Pompeii IPA,3.7,"Decorah, Iowa","16 oz can.  Pours a cloudy golden color and capped by a small off white layer of foam that fades away quickly to a few bubbles and some lace around the glass.  The aroma shows notes of citrus fruits with hints of orange, grapefruit, and melon over a toasted biscuit malt base with hints of resinous pine.  The flavor follows suit with notes of orange, grapefruit, and earthy notes and backed up by the biscuit malts and a firm hop bitterness on the back end with some lingering notes of resinous pine.  Medium bodied and fairly smooth with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and dry citrus on the finish.  Definitely more on the dry and bitter end of the spectrum than the usual juicy IPAs.  Solid and easy drinking IPA that is fairly old school with its level of bitterness.",juiceisloose,Decorah
2823,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Vanilla Bourbon Barrel,4.6,"Chicago, Illinois","Az óév utolsó söréül választott főzet varázslatos vanília aromáit hordozza magán, mely az olvasztott csokoládé, fagylaltöntet, mályvacukor, karamell és bourbon megnyerő kompozíciójával lép frigyre. Olajos, sűrű és tüzes kortyai a bársonyosság legmagasabb fokán izzanak, magukba forrasztva minden elemet, amely valaha is kapcsolatban állt a csokoládé, konyakmeggy, s természetesen a vanília fenséges, mégsem uralkodó vérvonalával, s amely a hordóban történő érlelés legnagyszerűbb példájaként szolgálhat bármely főzet összetevője számára.

The flavor follows with the tropical fruit notes up front along with some earthy pine and an metallic note as well with a firm bitterness on the back end.  Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and tropical finish with that lingering metallic note.  Something is definitely off with this one and the can is only 3 weeks old.

The nose is overpowering whiskey and mild oak and roasted malt.  The taste isn't very sweet, which in this case is unfortunate since its needed to cut the alcohol flavor.  As it is, oak and whiskey clearly dominate, while minor chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt do come through as well.  Long and heavy oak finish.  Full bodied and thick in texture.

The aroma is an assault of vanilla, then chocolate, fudge, licorice, and mild roasted malt.  This one is sweet.  The flavor of vanilla is strong as expected, but it isn't overwhelming like it was in the nose.  Whiskey, and oak are distinct, chocolate comes through later on in the sip, there are traces of licorice, and some roasted malt.  A quick sharp aftertaste is vanilla with a touch of whiskey.  Its medium to full in body and has a smooth, creamy texture.  Despite a mild whiskey burn, this one isn't as intense as other Bourbon County offerings.  It much smoother and easier drinking.  All told, this is a wonderful beer.",Scipio,Chicago

A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az ""imperial"" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival. Ebben az esetben tehát az ízek befogadhatatlanul sokszínű jellegéhez egy intenzív, mégis a kompozícióba kívánkozó karakter csatlakozik a kávé személyében, így téve megismételhetetlenül egyedivé az eleve speciális, önmagában sem mindennapi főzetet.",adster,Chicago

Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban. A legnemesebb tölgyes, fahordós, whiskyben ázó dohányleveles, bőrszerű, őszi faleveles aromák, amihez kékvérű test bársonyos, csillogó jegyei társulnak, a maguk ezerszínű palástját felöltve, melyet órákig csodálhatunk, betelni mégsem tudunk vele. Az aromák folyékony halmazállapotba kerülve konyakmeggy, vanília, bourbon, csipkebogyólekvár és füstös eperdzsem varázslatos keverékét adják, melyet angolszász stílusban közvetítenek, teret engedve azonban minden elem vibrálásának, így téve lehetővé végtelennek tetsző részletességű komponenseinek érvényesülését, melyek egyenként is művészi értékkel bírnak.

The pour is cinnamon brown completed by a eggshell-white rim of foam around the glass. A taste now, wow, a lot of flavor here. It's like a slice of berry pie, what kind I cannot say.

Creamy, mocha-beige, dense and stable, thick head on a black beer with thin mahogany edge.  Aroma of coffee cream, mocha ice cream, caramel candy, 'Haagse hopjes', candied figs, ground pecan nuts, cold cappuccino.  Rounded onset, quite restrained in sweetness especially for a postmodern coffee stout, hints of dried fig, medlar and fried pear, softish carb, creamy and soft, even somewhat silky mouthfeel.  Pecan-nutty, caramelly and black-toasty maltiness, bittersweet with more bitterness than sweetness, remaining altogether quite dry, with the roasty side enhanced by softly bittering coffee - which does, in the end, provide a strong retronasal aroma highlighted by some warming, gin-like alcohol and a peppery hop bitter note.  Hard caramel- and cappuccino-like aspects linger.  Soft, creamy and drier than expected, this is a somewhat distinct, but in many aspects great coffee stout, though hardly the best stout in Europe...  Still quite a special one indeed, but in a subtle and indirect manner that not all the geeks will pick up, I think.",Alengrin,Newcastle upon Tyne

Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish.

Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt. This is excellent.",bhensonb,Portland

3011,Foothills Frostbite Black IPA,3.8,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Well I grabbed this brew from Foothills because I was curious if this was the same beer as the Cottonwood Frostbite winter ale I remember having many years ago at a beer festival. Although apparently Foothills bought out some of Cottonwood’s brands, this beer has a very different profile than what I remember of the Cottonwood rendition. Rather than being a boozy strong ale, this is a brisk clean-finishing and true-to-style black IPA with a fairly light roastiness and a balanced hoppy bitterness. The appearance was excellent also, with a bright white foamy head that almost imitated the cascading presentation of a Guinness stout. Aroma was charred wheat and herbal pacific hops, and the flavor likewise was a balanced mix of roasted malt and fresh bitter hops. Only mild disappointment with this beer was the lack of nuance - no complex chocolate or coffee notes or bold hop flavors - but that being said I enjoyed this and would pick it up again. Not my favorite black IPA, but possibly my favorite offering from Foothills Brewing.",eRock_2013,Winston-Salem

Taste is dry, minimally sweet, minimally bitter, yeasty fruity and bready malty, notes of plum and cherry, dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, some treacle, honey, blue grapes, a touch of apple, baked apple, chestnut and even Brazil nut; minimally warming, alcoholic finish. Relatively watery texture with a minimally slimy touch, slightly prickly carbonation. Rich and complex, definitely a sipper, but partially so light and almost refreshing that you might be teased to speed up the frequency of sips into dangerous areas.

3028,High Water West Meets East,5,"Chico, California","Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.

The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.

Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.

West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture.

Being quite impressed with everything I've had from Kundmüller before, this came as a bit of a disappointment to me, to be honest. I guess they wanted tro experiment with a dry-hopped Doppelbock and it's just not working for me because it's overly dominated by the quite floral and grassy hops, while the malts add little but sweetness here, that is at least somewhat balanced by the rather distinct bitterness though.

This ""Black Weizenbock"" certainly lives up to its name, being a lot more malt-focussed than your average Weizenbock, with some lightly roasted, caramel, chocolate and dark fruit notes coming through apart from the typical yeast esters. However, there's also a light tartness to this that seems somewhat displaced here. While the balance seems a little off, this still makes for quite an interesting and enjoyable brew at the end of the day. I would have wished for some stronger roasted notes and could have done without that light tartness though, which I'm not sure is really intended here.

Moderate- carbonation. Very light grapefruit notes and a hint of passion fruit.  Rather nondescript malt lurking. There could perhaps even be a splash of the alleged tangerine in there, but the most prominent flavour is a plain hop tartness. Possibly Simcoe? Somewhat puts me in mind of Cloudwater's Simcoe + Green Tea soda...I daren't say more. Not bad for the ABV, and even something of a grower,  but a bit light for my tastes. Still, that's what it's going for, so i can't really knock this. Would be great on a sunny day - which it is.",LagerGuide122,Manchester

Forward is fairly malty and quite sweet, medium/ heavy bodied with a slightly above average amount of carbonation to it and a nice toffee flavor to it with a solid mouthfeel, as well as a light fruity reduced grape note almost a bit like ice wine with faint hints of honey, dates and, trace of plum and rum raisin.

Primarily orange-juicy, helped by the mouthfeel, with a pale malt serving to add very slight, gentle pithiness. Some slight mango tropical tints too. Smooth, sweet, bland in a good way - it's a bit like vanilla - sure it's plain, but who doesn't like vanilla? Especially well done vanilla. This is well done vanilla. Classic easy-drinker with classic hops, and just has that touch of class in how it's all put together that makes this absolutely, evidently craft and not supermarket fare. Balance of bitter and sweet is spot on too. I've had a lot of craft Pales that didn't quite meet the mark set here in sheer execution. But still, it's vanilla.

The hoppiness of Torpedo is toned down, but the results are oh so fascinating once this subdued IPA bitterness is coupled with generous barrel aging. The bourbon notes provide a lovely baseline, while subtle grapefruit, orange, and pine notes play off the vanilla and wood from the barrel. Texture's dreamy in its supple smooth feel; ABV's a nonfactor. Just a frickin' amazing beer.",oobawa,Chico

Medium to full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is good. This does not have the typical Darkness full body, but still solidly supports the barrel & chiles. Unsure how this would age. Lovin the cinnamon/barrel taste blend. Finishes sweetly, with barrel & cinnamon. This has an interesting blend. Multi dimensional with the chiles. Still would like more of the typical Darkness thickness. 16.3

3517,WellBeing Intentional IPA,3.7,"Maryland Heights, Missouri","Can (Dec 26, 2019 canning). Head is initially large, frothy, rocky, off-white, mostly lasting. Body is lightly hazy dark yellow to light amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, corn starch), lightly to moderately hoppy (grapefruit pith), with a light note of metal shavings. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation.

Certainly among the best NA beers available. Still room for improvement, mind you, as the the aroma doesn't really shout IPA (it's not really all that hoppy, just some generic pithy grapefruit that barely rises above the malt notes, and it's also slightly marred by a metallic/tinny odor). But wow, the appearance?! Big rocky heads are rare even in beers with alcohol. And a great mouth experience for an NA beer too...excellent lip-smacking sweet/bitter balance and quite a nice fluffy mouthfeel too. Such a shame they couldn't coax an assertive hoppy nose outta this one, and with more interesting hops (which seems like it would be the easiest part, right?)...this could've been near 4+ territory, which would be incredible for an NA beer!",Ernest,Maryland Heights

Very clear copper amber pour with an off-orange head leaving spotty lacing. Aroma has pine, lemon, tangerine, stone fruits, honey, other tropical fruits, and solid dry hopping, with toffee. Taste brings lemon and piney hops, stone fruits, citrus, and honey, all on a solid sweet toffee backbone. Certainly hoppy, although muddled with the hop varietals, yet with that solid malt backbone. Some dry hop evidence, although not so much to completely dry this out. Almost full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is fine/solid. Finishes slightly to the sweet fruity side of bittersweet. Shrug? Congrats on 10 years for one of my obviously favorite breweries. This specific one winds up quite muddled. 13.8",AWISLguy,Boston

Taste is similar at first but throws in a lot of acidic vinous notes along with a bigger gourmand presence and a clear boozy note. Not necessarily bourbon but a general spirit booziness.

Mouthfeel is somewhat dense and chewy but with a lighter landing that I don't fully appreciate. Sticky. Medium bitterness. Medium-low carbonation. Semi-long finish. 

Overall: Expected way more to be honest. Maybe it needs to warm up more to show its true potential. Been resting in the cabinet for quite a while too but it feels unbalanced and a bit all over the place.",EerieDrinks,Asheville

Gentle mineral-water aspects, some red/dark berry elements, pretty laid-back in general. Light, sweet amber ale. Faint hints of a toasted bread malt.

A pleasing imperial stout delivers a polished experience without going overboard. It is hard to see much here that isn't available in a typical example of the style. Even so thanks to Drake for sharing this during a winter tasting.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Smoky coffee, espresso, and sticky hazy malts crawl over the nose in search of places to leave a mark. The fluid black base supports a lean mocha head.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky plum, dark fruit, and chocolate empower the rich profile that warms the throat. It then ebbs into a malty dense texture that sticks in the palate. There are few objections though nothing that stands out as an amazing release that sets itself apart in a busy crowd.",Brigadier,Charlottesville

An excellent gem from the East Coast shows that Allagash is still on top of their game when it comes to balancing tartness with depth. It might not be my favorite release yet just thinking about it makes me wish that I had a glass to sip right now.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vinegary plums, raspberry, and a sharp abrasive profile gnaw at the nose. The vanilla head rests over a bed of caramel as the lean base swirls freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cherry and Sour Patch Kids imbued with raspberry cling to the senses as the vinegar works it way into every corner of the throat. A rich finish of freshly picked strawberries polish off an excellent experience. I would happily drink this again if I came across a tap line.",Brigadier,Portland

3753,Boulevard Love Child No. 3,3.4,"Kansas City, Missouri","750 ml bottle

Well past its prime, this release shows what happens when you sit on a bottle too long. I can only imagine what it must have been like in its prime to still be this solid. If it weren't for the packed shelves I would love to try a few more Love Child releases.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A rich ivory head dances upwards as the caramel body chews at the foundation. A strong sour intensity has taken root as the brett is center stage. Behind it the musty profile indicates other aspects have mellowed with time.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Acidic astringent chocolate tickles the tongue. Clearly past its prime, this Flemish sour hits the palate with a harsh bite. Even the finish, tart Tootsie Roll, shows signs of having been more polished in the past. It will be nice to get more of these out of the cellar to make room for fresher offerings.",Brigadier,Kansas City

3758,Central Waters Agreeable Interlude,3.4,"Amherst, Wisconsin","On tap in Madison, WI

The packaging drew me in but despite having a bottle in the cellar I finally caved and ordered a draft at a local bar. I'm happy though as the results are subpar for a Central Waters imperial stout. This is less imperial and more mundane. Save your money for their other more polished releases.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A delicate mocha head rests above the fluid black base. Moving freely around the shaker it releases droves of smoky ash, espresso, and cocoa in a profile that feels a bit tame for the style. 

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky espresso, malt, and cocoa enrich the palate with a fluid refreshing feel that dances rather than crawls over the tongue. Given the description I was anticipating a bit more. I'll still crack open the bottle to see if I get better results but overall this feels like a half hearted effort from Amherst.",Brigadier,Amherst

3761,Perennial Abraxas,4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri","On tap in Madison, WI

A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate.

This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic.

With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.

Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.

This particular style has piqued my curiosity for a while. Either I'm suddenly seeing these everywhere or more breweries are trying to set themselves apart with something unique. Regardless this is well worth sampling at the source as part of a flight.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A coppery reddish base glints under a dirty vanilla head. Spicy rye and Twizzlers sharpen into focus alongside a malty core. Almost immediately it is obvious that this is not your average rye beer.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Sharp caramel dipped in rye whiskey pushes to the front of the throat with an urgency.

I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness.

A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.

Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.

04-02-2020; bottle; at home (bought at de Bodega, Capelle Aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. 
The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.",Gangstergafje,Ertvelde

3856,Northern Monk / By The River Northern Powerhouse Brew Series 2019 007,4.5,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!",LagerGuide122,Leeds

3885,Green Flash Double Columbus IPA,3.2,"San Diego, California","January 18th, 2014 - My best guess is that this beer is going to be a gob smack of Columbus hops, practically dripping out of the bottle with resin and pine. And that's exactly what I get. But before I get to the very succinct review (half of the word count is ""resin""), I want to admire the look, which in this slightly fluted glass has a beautiful auburn color with a good finger of head, and a rich population of geysers. The aroma is sticky, fresh and resinous, and direct with it's hop profile, as expected. The flavor has one foot in the pine camp and the other in a rusty metallic taste. It is intense, and squeezes a long line of honey through the taste to give this a super sweet flavor, which gets tiring by the end of the glass. But those first few bold sips are fine to get an idea of how strong a directly and forward Columbus hops based beer can be.",GarrettB,San Diego

Aroma of dried wakame, old coriander seed, sourdough, sour apples, old dry lemon peel, some lime zest, bread crust.  Crisp, sour onset, lemony, sour apples but also a subtle sweetish pineapple accent, minerally carbonation, drying lactic tartness throughout accompanied by a light seaweed saltiness – but remaining very light, much lighter in fact than in most modern Goses (and probably closer to the salty level of historical Gose).  Some chicken broth-like ‘meatiness’ in the end, over a wheaty-bready, slick maltiness, spiced by a dash of old coriander seed.  Pretty nice, seemingly a bit more complex than the average modern Gose, but at the same time more restrained and less salty as well.

Medium thick, mousy, pale greyish off-white head lacing in shreds over a clear, copper-hued burgundy red-brown beer.

Sweet onset with impressions of dried fig and date as well as some apple peel and blue plum; medium carb, full oily and bit vinous mouthfeel.  Caramelly malt core with a soft brown-bready edge as well as an upcoming smoky note, reminiscent of smoked sausages and even (vaguely) bonfire, plunging into a long, warming, complex finish coloured by a late peppery hop bitter touch, lingering malt sweetness and smokiness as well as brandy-like alcohol.

Aroma of passionfruit, dry sherry, sour plums, candi sugar, fig jam, pech, brown rum, wood glue, old red wine, brambleberries, brandy.  Fruity, estery onset, sour with a sweetish core, impressions of blackberry, fig and sour plums, soft carb, strong lactic sourness drying the palate, over a caramelly, softly bready malt backbone; woody tannins add further dryness in the finish, with a strong and evidently unsurprising impression of dry and tannic red wine (‘gecorseerd’ as we say in Dutch), quite complex, woody, fruity long and warming.

3966,Brix City Island Jams,3.8,"Little Ferry, New Jersey","Coconut- and pineapple-flavoured milkshake IPA, thanks Sérgio (the brewer of Totenhopfen in Luxemburg) for sharing.  Papery lacing, off-white, mousy, stable head on a misty apricot blonde beer with ochre-ish hue.  Aroma very strongly coconut-forward (coconut milk), some pineapple jam but much less outspoken than the coconut, blood orange, vanilla custard, dough, milk powder, powder sugar, ground hazelnuts somewhere, nougat.  Sweet and creamy onset with a citric twist to it, pineapple indeed in a candied- or jam-like way, hints of mango, lychee and blood orange, fizzy carb (quite sharpish for the style but not to a bothersome degree); full, supple, soft body with lactose creaminess – and sweetness on top of the malt sweetness.  Becomes highly aromatized very quickly, by tropical hops (mango) but even more so by vanilla (love it) and most predominantly so by the coconut; some light and late powdery bitterness lingers, but creamy lactose sweetness and coconut last for a long(er) time.  This is about as decadent as it gets in the vast IPA world, but I seem to have a thing for milkshake IPAs if they are well done, and that certainly is the case here.  This kind of desserty sweetness was unthinkable in any IPA as little as ten years ago, but here we are – products like this are bound to attract a large audience, and frankly I would like to see an adventurous Belgian brewery tackle this offspring of the ubiquitous New England IPA (the only one who has successfully done a milkshake IPA in this country so far that I know of, is Totem, so hopefully others will follow).",Alengrin,Little Ferry

J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur.

Egg-white, membrane-lacing, creamy, thin, irregularly edged and eventually all but dissolving head, cloudy yolk-yellow robe with pale orangey tinge – the whole thing quickly looks like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Aroma of mandarin, mango, ripe pineapple juice, sweetish with a sourish edge, fizzily carbonated; soft doughy malt body, completely drenched in dank, very sultry, tropical hoppiness, sweet-citrusy and a bit mango-like, but with a powdery, weedy bitterishness in the end as well – though eventually more bitterness comes from wodka-like alcohol, emphasizing an overall effect I can only describe as Screwdriver-like.  Typical new wave double NEIPA, mimicking orange juice with wodka poured in.",Alengrin,Newcastle upon Tyne 
4060,Vibrant Forest Dahlia,3.2,"Hardley, Hampshire","Chardonnay barrel aged, light ‘session’ sour, from a waxed bomber bought at Geers in Oostakker near Ghent.  Thin and loose, mousy, bubbly, snow white head disappearing completely in the end, misty pale yellowish straw blonde robe with lime-greenish tinge.  Aroma of diluted lemon juice, indeed Chardonnay wine and white grape skin, green apple, soap, buttermilk, lime, dough, fried ‘courgette’, pumice.  Restrained fruity esters (green banana, green apple) in a softly lactic-sour, minerally environment, softly carbonated, with a soapy wheatiness and cereally main maltiness in the middle; drying lactic sourness in the end too, but remaining fairly gentle, while wood tannins from the barrels remain all but absent.  Still, the finish does bring a notable white wine flavour, which in the end adds some complexity to the whole; lots of chalkiness lingering too, though.  Soft sour ‘afterburn’.  Fruity, not lacking in complexity but it does lack in the promised Brett and wood effects, even if the Chardonnay is certainly there.  Feels like a Berliner Weisse with a dash of Chardonnay thrown in, and that is probably not that far removed from the truth.  Interesting, but too expensive for what it is and delivering only half of what it promises.",Alengrin,Hardley

4068,M.I.A. Miami Weiss,2.6,"Miami, Florida","Perfectly clear deep copper and almost amber coloured body with a decent two centimetre tall, very soapy white head that fades to literally nothing on top - just like a soda - pretty bad, actually. Aroma of wheat, bubble gum, oranges, a dash of curacao and some softer earthy and malt components that make this okay, but not great, in the nose, at least. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong wheatie and yeastie flavours dominate with a large cardboardie and funky flavour at first that shows some light orange and curacao notes, a dash of citrus, a little grain and some more assertive sugars that show caster sugar notes and a slight touch of fruit-based sugars. Aftertaste shows the more dry and slighlty softer flavours from the malt with a dry and orangey finish that has some light sweetness, but mostly the stale or funky wheat-based malt profile that doesn't have any complexities or depth from the yeast strain at all. Overall, a pretty poor beer overall, and definitely not a respectable FILTERED wheat beer as this definiteliy shows as a Wheat Ale, and even then, not a good one with bad/old wheat notes, no real yeast depth and no other complexities from other notes - just the wheat shows through, in a not-so-good way. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 28-December-2017 for US$2,29 sampled just over two years later at home in Washington on 04-February-2020.",jgb9348,Miami

Aroma is full of lacto upfront, with everything else taking a backseat - there’s some floral hops in there, but they’re drowned out by the yogurt.

One bottle of Blåbeer fifteen years ago and I'm still chasing the high every chance I get. I go in knowing there's absolutely no chance, and I yet I go in anyway. 

Hazy plum pour, relatively abundant head. Marvelous blueberry aroma, some funk, some wood. Bracingly tart at first, but the palate acclimates. Full-bodied. Lots of blueberry character.

4106,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,4.1,"Chico, California","12 oz. bottle from a six-pack brought back from Raley's in Chico, CA.  The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!",J_man,Chico

Aroma is light, but what's there is still distinctively of Centennial hops (floral, herbal, grapefruit) as in Two Hearted.  Flavor light as well, of course, but again herbal and floral hops with a bit of grapefruit, a bit of biscuit.  Also has the right amount of bitterness for the strength.  This is quite good given how light it has to be, but that lightness prevents me from enjoying it enough to give it a higher score.",flatmatt,Comstock

Aroma may have passionfruit and hemp seed, but reminds me more of Jolly Ranchers.  Taste is sweet, more like a soda than a malt liquor, with hardly any booziness.  Body is medium with lively carbonation.  It fails as a beer but succeeds as something to get you buzzed quickly if you don't like the taste of normal beer.",ccex,Rochester
4116,Dunloe Oceans Between,4,"Davis, California","Can from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours dark brn/blk with a huge foamy Guinness tan head. Pours like Guinness! Nitro like. Aroma of dark chocolate and somewhat toasty malt escapes the foam. Med plus body. Flavor is slightly burnt malt, chocolate and hints of darker fruits. I think it's pretty dry. Bitter arguably comes from the malt. It's a very nice drink.",bhensonb,Davis

I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.

Sweet-ish, chocolately dark malty and spicy aroma, notes of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate sauce, some vanilla, cinnamon, peppery spicy and minimally smoky whiffs of chipotle. Taste is sweet, chocolately dark malty and spicy, notes of cinnamon and vanilla, peppery spicy, minimally smoky notes of chipotle bring that typical effect of increasing, accumulating hotness. Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, completely hidden alcohol. Exactly what it wants to be (Mexican Hot Chocolate) but not in an Imperial way; spiciness really pushes the envelope without crossing the line to discomfort. Pretty good.",Idiosynkrasie,Eau Claire

4242,Upland Paw Paw,5,"Bloomington, Indiana","Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. 

The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.

Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

4249,Brix City Ill Street Blues ,3.7,"Little Ferry, New Jersey","473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.",Idiosynkrasie,Little Ferry

4253,Left Hand White Russian Nitro,3.1,"Longmont, Colorado","Pours a clear, golden amber coloration with a small, creamy, stable head. Smells of sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with just a hint of actual coffee. Taste is very much dominated by sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with some hazelnut also coming through, as well as just a hint of coffee and white chocolate. Finishes almost sickly sweet, with some coffee cream and vanilla lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While this does an ok job at imitating a White Russian, it's just way too syrupy sweet and creamy/milky for an enjoyable Imperial Stout, with the vanilla being way overdone and very little coffee coming through. While the mouthfeel is all right, I expected more from a nitro can. Nobody loves the Big Lebowski more than me, but this does not tie it together very well at all, no need to be careful about this beverage.

Aroma is lemon-lime, grass, pale malts, and a little dough.  Some light citrus notes as well.  Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.

4367,Siren Bourbon Turkish (Project Barista - 2019) ,3.5,"Finchampstead, Berkshire","330ml glass bottle from Seven Seasons, Hoxton. Served at cellar temperature into a stout glass. Dated as bottled on 17/05/19. 

The beer pours a perfect black colour developing a one and a half finger mocha colour head. Uniform with medium sized bubbles. The head settles to a thick layer before finally disappearing half way through the drink. A lovely lacing. Visually this one looks like a top beer. 

The aroma has an identical profile to tiramisu. Heavy dark roasted coffee. Vanilla. Woody. Muscovado. Figs. Coffee, and the woody smell of the barrel ageing are the dominant notes. Nasally stunning. 

The taste is where the beer deviates away from great, in my opinion. Too alcoholic. I do understand the beer is 11.5% and imperial in style, but on the tastebuds the alcohol dominates and little else is present. I feel as the only reason I can taste coffee, vanilla or oak is because of the strength of aroma leading to perception. The beer is moderately sweet. 

The beer feels thick in the mouth, a lot of alcohol warmth, also in the pit of the stomach. A slightly dry, moderately sweet feel. 

Maybe just too much for my palate. A great beer for look and aroma but too heavily dominated by booze on the taste. 

One I’d put in the same category as Samuel Smiths Chocolate Stout. I think it would be good in a very small amount. But even on a slow slow drink 330 feels far too much. A sharer.",PubTun33,Finchampstead

4459,Phase Three Pixel Density,3.4,", Illinois","On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.",tmoreau,

4585,Vintage Snazzy Pants,3.3,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic. As a result it is hard to recommend this unless you really need to rate everything on the menu.",Brigadier,Madison
4586,Vintage Grain Train,3.8,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy oak, vanilla, and earthy almonds transition to a profile of dry sherry. The soothing warm finish glows on the back of the throat. The hops accent a well balanced experience that might be the best draft at Vintage right now.",Brigadier,Madison
4587,Vintage Vapour Trail,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A typical New England style IPA, this polished example of the style stands out as a drinkable and accessible version that can help further understand the thought behind it. I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness. From start to finish it provides a hook that shines the stage light on a polished release. Drafts like this show that Vintage is not resting on their laurels.",Brigadier,Madison

4589,Vintage Crandaddy,3.5,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tart cranberry lined with salty Sour Patch Kid sugar scour the tongue clean. The texture becomes more abrasive over time as it lingers in the throat. Compared to others it might be somewhat pedestrian but it does enough to be a worthwhile experience.",Brigadier,Madison

04-02-2020; bottle; at home (bought at de Bodega, Capelle Aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. 
The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.",Gangstergafje,Ertvelde

Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.

4817,August Schell Stag Series Nordic IPA,4.2,"New Ulm, Minnesota","Fruity aroma: pineapple, citrus - perhaps orange? - tropical fruits.

Color is cloudy burnt orange (brighter with a backlight) and a good level of fine carb bubbles rising to a tall, slightly off-white bubbly-thick head. The head recedes fairly quickly, leaving great-looking strings of lacing around the glass. After just a few minutes, the head is a cap with mounds of thick bubbles.

Taste is different; taking me a bit to characterize it. The pineapple and tropical fruits from the aroma are there, and strongly so, but the taste at the forefront is interesting, very nice and enjoyable, but hard for me to describe (I checked some other reviews - they were no help... maybe it's just me...) 

It is a good tasting beer, despite my lack of words to describe it.  There is some cracker malt presence behind the fruit flavors. A moderate bitterness begins a few seconds after each taste, that grows stronger and lingers into the aftertaste. This is not WC IPA level of bitterness, or even a Midwest IPA level, but more than sufficient to meet expectations for an IPA. The bitterness grows as you drink the beer.

The mouth feel has a solid body with decent carbonation.

The finish is semi-dry.

Overall, a very good IPA.",MNAle,New Ulm
4818,Boelens berrevoesj,2.3,"Belsele, Belgium","Gekregen van mijn nicht op 30-09-2019. En thuis geproefd op 25-01-2020. 
Berrevoesj wordt gebrouwen voor biercafé Berrevoesj in Liedekerke, het is ook een bijnaam die Liedekerke heel lang geleden kreeg omdat de inwoners in die tijd te arm waren om schoenen te kopen, ze moesten dan ook ‘berrevoesj’ (blootvoets) door het leven.
Het is een wazig-blond biertje dat veel wit schuim produceert in een romige vorm wat sterk aan het glas blijft kleven. Je ziet maar weinig fijne CO2 belletjes omhoog parelen. Het schuim zakt naderhand in elkaar tot een fijn laagje van iets meer dan 1 mm dikte met wat grove bellen tussen.
HET AROMA:
Fruitig met op de eerste plaats citrus en dan wat pompelmoes en mout.
DE SMAAK:
Wat hopbitter, citrus en mout
HET MONDGEVOEL:
Volle body met een licht-stoffige textuur en een normale koolzuurprikkeling.
DE NASMAAK:
Vloeit uit en de hopbitterheid blijft toch lang hangen.
HET TOTAALGEVOEL:
Op zijn manier een harmonieus biertje.
HET VERDICT:
Geen geweldig biertje, het is vooral het lichtbittere dat hier de show wil stelen maar na een tijdje wordt die smaak wat wranger. Het lijkt me dat het bittere (IBU 52) hier door iets anders wat getemperd wordt.

5001,Incendiary Under The Trestles Belgian Tripel,3.5,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","UTT is anything but subtle.  This heavy-handed Americanized version of the style ups the ante in every sense of the word. Tons of banana and yeast esters are where it starts. Sweety bready pale malt character starts to take over mid sip. It winds up with a vegetal smack of spicy hops and aggressive wash of carbonation, then a pretty hot alcohol finish. It's good, but is completely lacking in the subtlety of the original style.

5006,Incendiary Lemon Wit,4.3,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Incendiary hits it out of the park on this one. I love this beer. While it's not the prettiest (dull maize with zero head), this ugly duckling has a lot of great qualities. Classic coriander and wheat cracker nose dosed with an aggressive fresh lemon zest on top. The flavors really pop with a long wash at the end of each swallow intensely adding its character to the mix and lifting the bright lemon zest to the forefront. The absolute perfect summertime beer.
",freekyp,Winston-Salem
5007,Incendiary Night Shift,3,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Night Shift is a seriously weird beer. Points for uniqueness, though it doesn't completely work. The nose is old bong water filtered through charred chicory wood and evergreen needles. Intense oily Mosaic hops lend a bit of motor oil aroma, which is pushed down by the intense woodiness of the Midnight Wheat malt bill. It's a fun beer to power through, if not completely enjoyable.

The almond flavor is a little too subtle in comparison to the other components to truly give a rainbow cookie experience, but it's on the right track. Still, a pretty good sweet stout, and one that hides the ABV fairly expertly.

5365,Gypsy Road Lawnmower Light ,3.3,"Kernersville, North Carolina","Adam lays down a skillful light American lager that can bridge the gap for non-craft beer drinkers. For those that are used to craft, its still a fine choice on the lighter side. Lawnmower is a pretty golden pour, crystal clear, with a resilient small ring of pure white head. Its really nice to look at.  Mild honey and delicate hop florals play well together. Its clean, light bodied, and crisp. It's also better than 90% of the beers in this style. Well done.",freekyp,Kernersville

Smells of lemon acidity, strong grassy hops, some garlic hops, and brett.  Tastes of lime tartness up front, some doughy pale malt, sour citrus, and earthy brett notes.  Oak is light for Odd Breed, but the finish has a lingering woody flavor.  Surprisingly soft carbonation, considering the foamy bottle.  Chewy body.  I was hoping for something less sour when I read about this.  It's good, but the tartness seems to be the dominant flavor.  It doesn't let the malt profile or hops come through quite as much.",ctipping,Pompano Beach

5374,Source Ultra Samba,4.2," Colts Neck, New Jersey","16 oz can from the brewery, 1/30/20.  Canned 1/27/20, so pretty damn fresh!    The pour is unclear, golden-orange, with a white head that leaves some moderate, drippy streaks of lacing on the glass.  Bright, slightly tart pineapple, some mango and apricot as well.  Quite tropical.  Juicy, but not overly sweet.  Has a tang and a spice to the finish.  Quite good, and shines even more as I get toward the end of the can.  Seems as though I am pretty much the only person left on this site enjoying beers from this brewery, but judging by the crowds the rest of the NJ beer crowd likes them as much as I do.  Looking forward to enjoying and /or sharing with others the rest of my cans from this release.

Yellow pour, nice white head. Something very odd happens when I first taste this beer. It's warm. Or rather, it feels warm. It's straight out of the fridge, and I double-check the bottle temperature. Cold. But it tastes warm. It's so soft and full on the palate without any thickness, stickiness, or richness that it feels like a cask ale. I have no clue how TF they do that. But ok...First sip is a bit sweet, a bit herbal. Chardonnay. Saison loveliness.The palate acclimates. How do you slow down on this beer? It's amazing. A guilty pleasure for the fancy saison set, but so much pleasure and so little guilt. Not a beer I'd bring to tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the subtly of my palate—but totally a beer that I'd bring to a tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the fact that I've got my f'n ear to the f'n rails.

Pours oranged tinged gold with a fine, foamy white head. Aroma is sort of pineapple strawberry. Med body or close. Flavor is very different from my familiar flavors.

Decently bitter. Worth drinking.",bhensonb,Paso Robles

5460,Idle Hands Craft Ales Splitter,3.9,"Malden, Massachusetts","Interesting stuff. Pours a murky dark golden with big white cap that fades to a skim and leaves some lacing. Aromas are foremost Belgian esters along with some melon and dark fruits. Flavors differ from nose with more emphasis on ripe fruit but still some banana and melon.

5461,Three Taverns Hop Leaf Project Transcendo,4.2,"Decatur, Georgia","Pours hazy apricot with a thick and fairly persistent porcelain head. Aroma yields resiny hops and sweet citrus that reach out and touch you from half a meter away; as you close in, hops get more piney, citrus gains a little tartness, and fresh malt makes an appearance. Flavor lays out piney and slightly bitter hops, tangy and sweet citrus with tropical character on the side, and crisp fresh malt. Texture provides good, smooth body and lively fizz, plus a hoppy and fruity finish. Transcendo ordinary beer!",Cybercat,Decatur
5462,Desert Valley Big Stout,3.3,"Albuquerque, New Mexico","Taster at the Craftroom. Near black pour, persistent creamy head. Aroma is almost non-existent.  Taste is both sweet and roasty, which converts to bitternes at the finish. Malty, cola.",stevoj,Albuquerque

5484,Union Corners Eau de Currant,3.4,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

The final pour of the night was something unusual - a fruited brut kolsch. I generally enjoy the dry nature of brut beers. The additional flavors manage to transform it into a release that stands out from the typical kolsch.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A bubbly colored body radiates with fruity currants and dry textures that   sets itself apart from the usual brut kolsch or IPA. Rather than a bone dry texture of champagne it layers on top a creamy fruit.

FLAVOR / PALATE
The blend of black currant and champagne transform this from the typical brut beer to a dark slightly chewy experience. While still very drinkable it definitely is transformed by the addition of dark fruits. While not my usual choice it does try something new without being a total disaster.",Brigadier,Madison
5485,Union Corners Joie de Vivre,3.4,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A playful Belgian influenced IPA takes things in a different direction than the usual release. While it still contains that trademark candi sugar it also adds a more malty tone than most. With releases like this I'll be sure to pay more attention to Union Corners in the future.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A cool base the color of melted chocolate rests under a creamy vanilla head. The laid back core emits waves of malty yeast and candi sugar - almost like an Elephant Ear chased by iced tea. It then melts almost immediately into the background.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Driven mostly by a malty core the blend of iced tea and yeast warm the tongue. A cool texture grounded in mellow sun tea then melts on the throat. There's less bitterness than originally expected though it does enough to be memorable. I'd happily drink a full pint if there were not other options.",Brigadier,Madison
5486,Union Corners Seneca's Reserve,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A creamy regional stout shines with promise from first impression to the last sip. I was not sure what to expect at first but it grew on me until I seriously considered ordering a full pour. If this sits around until my next visit I may do so.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Creamy oatmeal cookies soaked in soft fruity coffee warm the air with a gentle nose that soon fades away. The fluid black base dances freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky coffee chased by a spoonful of oatmeal transition gently to a finish of dry cereal. The balanced finish lightens the mood before melting into a cool maltiness. A great benchmark for the brewery as a whole, this well executed stout should give you an idea of whether Union Corners is in your wheelhouse or not.",Brigadier,Madison

5556,Beau's Night Märzen,3.5,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","Super crisp bright copper and light amber coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall off-white and tan head. Aroma of bright toffee, earth, grain, caramel, biscuits, deep yeast and a heavy hand of toast and pure malted barley. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grainy and earthy flavours throughout with a small but noticeable dose of alcohol, toffee, caramelised sugars, some peat and a bit of nuts and softer grassy notes at the finale. Aftertaste shows a more defined biscuity, grainy and earthier side of things with a bit of an off-balance between the malt (heavy) and hops (not very noticeable), however the body itself is good for the style and showing things about right, but seems to miss a good deal of complexity from the lager yeast instead of an ale yeast (which is naturally to be expected for the style), but it seems noticeable that this is good but lacking a touch. Overall, a decent beer with a good profile and biting malt and peat flavour that really shows through, especially at the end. I sampled this twenty ounce (one pint, four ounces) Ontario-styled bottle (slim and narrow) purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 02-December-2017 for US$3,99 sampled at home in Washington on 06-July-2018.

-Soft carbonation and lean residual sugars combine for a easygoing, cuddly mouthfeel.
-Hops are timid throughout. A touch of wooden bitterness in the finish, but that’s it.
-Again, beautifully developed soft malt character in this Beau’s lager.

Night malty smell to this beer, with notes of chocolate, oatmeal, and caramel. The smell is deceiving though, the taste is not as malty as the smell would make you believe. A quick malty taste quickly gives way to a dry hops. Notes of resin and pine linger on the tongue, however a slight malty-caramel taste creeps in at the end. Great looking and tasting beer, this is my first Marzen and I am impressed.

The taste confirms this, but the malt is more present here in the flavours. Bread grains, mild caramel and the hop creating a nice dry bitterness in the finish.

Got from a German supermarket, a four pack, coming in a very cool looking logo of a brewer and his beer, happy with his accomplishment! An unfiltered traditional cloudy beer. 

Have to say it looks absolutely fantastic on pour, a very lovely frothy white head appearing with a beer that has a gorgeous golden colour with a deep look.

A very decent head that sticks around, some good lacing, and with the deep hazy orange look, we have a great looking beer to admire.

On the nose one gets a very, very malty aroma, very clear and easy to find. An ok malty and yeasty smell, not bad at all.

On to the taste, very soft and creamy on the tongue initially, crispy and inoffensive, not much flavouring to taste and very, very smooth. Light and not really hitting the spot.

A lot of malts and some light grains, as expected, and a bit of fruit, but very light and very boring. Kind of a waste of time, with nothing really to get stuck into in terms of prominent or excitable tastes or flavours, dont think I will be buying this one again.

Aroma of ultra funky yeasts with some ashtry, a dash of brine, a lot of caster sugar, icing sugar, fake fruits and a big hit of old ladies (think grandmother) perfume - very funky, fragrant and pungent in a bad way. Light-bodied; Sharp fake lime flavous dominate at first with a lot of lactose and creamy notes with a lot of perfume, hay, grass and funky yeast flavours that show through as the old lady perfume of yesteryear, but in the mouth, which makes it that much worse. Aftertaste shows some somewhat better and lighter lime and lemon citrus notes, but the yeast and briney, salt components show stronger and leaves the palate somewhat salty and ready for the next sip, despite the perfume and funky yeast qualities. Overall, a pretty funky, pungent and odd-tasting beer that never seems to align with the style and/or what they were trying to produce, given the fact that the caster sugar, perfume and funky yeasts all hit about the same level and the citrus, brine and malt don't really show at all. Not really worth trying to find, unless you love your grandmother, her old perfume or a really funky yeast and citrus combination of a 'beer'.

Ridiculously clear and golden coloured body with an ugly, fast-dying pure white head that stays afloat for a few seconds, at most. Aroma of yes, unflattering malt and water with some light corn sugar thrown in the mix, but this is pretty bad, especially in the nose. Ultra-light-bodied throughout; Strong grainy and malt-based flavours that show more corn and ricer and fillers than any actual malts with a very light sweetness from honey and corn syrup at the end, but only a dash of vegetal flavours come through that vary anything from the not-so-good malts and off-sugars. Aftertaste shows the pure corn syrup and funky malts throughout without much else aside from water. Overall, a pretty standard 'macro light' beer that you'd expect with funky malt compontents, a lot of bad and off-flavours that aren't so good.

The beer pours a dark amber caramel colour. Generating a small white, bubbly head. Carbonation in the glass starts aggressively, but rapidly peters out.. The head reclines to nothing within a minute. 

The aroma is malt, chestnut purée and generic nuts. Cheap chocolate, reminding me of bad quality stouts and porters. Sweet with a light underlying bitter. Usually, even a poor beer smells inviting. This one just doesn’t. 

The taste is simply nut. Some can be identified as chestnut, some almond but mostly just a generic but taste. Some malt. Just like the aroma, cheap chocolate. Sweet like the aroma. The lightest lightest hint of bitter hop.

Comes in a bottle that looks like a regular beer. Certainly fooled me, that’s why I bought the fucking thing, thinking it was normal beer. Damn!!!!

On the pour I have to say the beer looks fantastic, a great big frothy white head, with a lot of good lively carbonation resulting in a nice clear golden coloured beer on appearance.

Head maintains very well, and some good lacing left on the glass. A good looking beer, sparkling, surprisingly good for a non alcoholic brew.…………

Smells pretty good too, getting a nice malty aroma on the nose for sure, but also a rather strange aroma. Guess could put that down to the sweet grains and floral hops. Some stringent corn smells too. Overall not bad on the nose.

Get a lot in the bottle, which is always a big plus.

The taste is a bit urgh, all very sickly sweet and very bitter. First impressions not good at all. Kind of a spicy and creamy off taste to it. 

For a non alcoholic beer it is quite hoppy and bitter, which is very surprising to me. It certainly does taste like a beer, with the malts, barley and grains to the fore, which is impressive. Could definitely fool people into thinking it was a regular beer. 

But not pleasant really, or very enjoyable, a dry finish with an artificial bitter taste that isn’t going to do it for me, will pass, thank you very much………….",Drinking_77,Frankfurt

Fairly sweet and heavy bodied with a moderately chocolaty tasting malt forward with ghostly note of hazelnuts to it, front end feels a little cloying and over sweet but not all that bad. 

Finish is fairly bitter tasting with a green sapling leaf hop flavor to it that grows as it warms, as well as an odd, hard to define flavor that I associate with a macro brew, like the back end of something like a Molson Canadian, a lingering faintly sour vaguely  chemical tasting like a bad fake flavored cough syrup with a faint trace of ethanol that hangs out on the aftertaste and builds up to be unpleasant",WortStein17,Creekside RPO Airdrie

The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.

On the palate, the dominant flavor of orange peel and grapefruit pith is bitter and harsh; I might as well have taken a bite out of an unpeeled orange and chewed it up, peel and all.  There's plenty of orange juice flavor, maybe some mango, but the harsh orange peel character is all I can think about.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and obviously, pretty astringent.  Overall, another terrible beer from Abomination.  It's not so much that this is over-hopped, although an argument could be made that it is, but rather it's just very poorly executed, so all the harsh astringency remains in the finished beer.

La question pour celle-ci est de savoir précisément si c'est une double ..
Mon exemplaire était à 16 mois avant sa date.
Couleur roux sombre à l'opacité moyenne, et clarté nette.
Bulles fines, en fontaine centrale, à montée lente.
Mousse beige, à fins flocons, stable à 1 mm.
Arômes de compote de prune, cassonade, pointe de cannelle.
1ère bouche fluide, à l'entame très modérée, caramélisée.
Arrière-bouche à la définition très vague, courte.
2ème bouche avec un côté guimauve et pantouflard.
Arrière-bouche faible, indéterminée, beaucoup trop caramélisée.
Longueur qui n'améliore rien dans la définition.
Jambes huileuses, longues.
Levure basique.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau abv, il laisse faire les choses trannnnquille ...
Finale paresseuse.
CONCLUSION : cette brune n'était donc pas une double, c'est assez vexant !
Elle penche plutôt du côté des brown américaines, avec des saveurs qui 
dégoulinent quelque peu .. et lambinent en tous les cas  (3/2/2/2/5)",corkyrory66,Silly

Taste is similar to the nose, little funky, bone dry. I get a nice wave of crisp fresh apples before being inundated with off flavours along the line of plastic bandaids. Ugh. Sweeter apples try to break through but that really, really aggressive and unpleasant boarding on burnt plastic and rubber cuts through it all.

Has a dark blackish brown body and okay foam on top of it. Flavour is way too boozy, maybe there's some coconut in there but it's overpowered by this heavy nail polish remover hanging on to my tongue and burning it.

I suspect it will be some totally bitter thicker hopped beer, as usual. This can was only a buck and a half at vintage. On pop there is lots of hops permeating the area. Clear pale. Taste is mouth coating veggie hops with decent co2. The co2 is a positive considering how hopped this IPA is. Bitter linger on the sides of the tongue after each big swig. Pretty big impression on the hops, you'd swear its above 5% fer-sher. Why would anybody want to subject their palate to hop bitterness without much alky kick? Just asking.",cheap,Chicago

6186,Strubbe Turbeau Noir,1.5,"Ichtegem, Belgium","On n'est pas loin d'avoir touché le fond avec cette Turbeau Noir, dont le nom est trompeur car il s'agit ici d'une bière fruitée par adjonction de concentré de fruits des bois. On ne parle donc pas ici de fruits des bois ayant macéré dans le brassin mais bien d'un ajout de concentré, ce qui n'est tout de même pas la panacée. La base est de plus complètement ratée. Avec un ajout de fruits sucrés, une petite acidité est nécessaire afin de couper le sucre et donner du peps à l'ensemble. Ici la base est sucrée, ce qui rend le tout sur-sucré, et en lus sans finesse, sans complexité, et sans intérêt si ce n'est de conférer des arômes de caramel, et de cola quelque peu chimique. Je ne vois pas quelle est la cible de cette bière. Le visuel se porte sur un brun un peu rosâtre surmonté d'une mousse brune d'un cm. Même si le nez n'est pas exceptionnel, finalement celui-ci n'est pas si mal vu la dégustation avec un cocktail de fruits des bois, de caramel et une fraîche amertume. Malheureusement l'amertume ne permet pas d'équilibrer la sucrosité à la dégustation ce qui la rend lourde et écœurante, surtout que les arômes quelque peu chimiques ne sont pas agréables. L'alcool à 8 % ne se ressent pas du tout et ne donne aucun caractère. Corpulence et longueur sont plutôt bonnes, mais à quoi bon?

Rotten corn with a hint of hair oil seems to dominate the aroma of Natty Daddy. I guess these cheap strong beers are fermented in vats full of human hair and rotten corn and grains, and two week old dead dog rotted in a trash bag.

First off, it looks like IC light, no color to make you think its cherry flavored.  It also smells like a cheap red Popsicle. Its fizzy and tastes something like cheap red soda, but nothing like the quality flavors of Cherokee red. Typical wan-nah be accepted new fru- fru -fruity beer. Whew. Probably should be kept out of the ratings like other stupid straight up ass soda pop flavored malt beverages. The artificial sweetener in this yields a lingering unpleasant perfume like finish  on each swig right to the end. Disappointing, not really beer; JMHO.

The nose is malty and buttery, some sourdough, not especially enticing.  Things get worse.  Flavors of cardboard, stale bread, hay, butter are wince-inducing.  Some caramely malt is in the background but it can't save an otherwise unenjoyable beer.  Light-medium in weight, medium in carbonation, reasonably dry, finishing stale and flat.

Medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Starts off with a repulsive and overwhelming nose of Scope mouthwash...why this would entice anyone to actually drink it is beyond me. Virtually no other aroma can make it past the wall of mouthwash. Not much better in the mouth...watery and overly sweet with mostly sourness for balance, and a dreadful aftertaste of mouthwash that won't go away.

There's something really off putting about the extremely tart, sour, overly flavored taste of this beer. I feel like I'm drinking cold dish water that someone threw a bunch of fruit rinds and other herbs and spices into with every sip. I choked my way through the first can and honestly had to just toss the last few bits of the 2nd and 3rd can bc it's just too much of a chore to drink. I'm looking at the 4th can and thinking, ""well maybe one day all the stores around me will be closed and I won't be able to buy any beer."" Any port in a storm kind of beer.

The majority of them r flat. I am on Social Security so I dont have a lot money. Most of my extra money goes on Bud light.  I collect all things Bud light. I have thousands of Bud light bottle caps. There's just something about a nice fresh cold beer when u (Or supposed 2 hear) that sound when u open the bottle. Then comes the disappointment when there's no sound. I would say it's been the last 13 20 packs where the majority r flat and that doesn't include the 1's I complained about earlier in the year.

Smoke, peat, cherry, fig, oak, and scotch, with the scotch lingering through into the finish.  Light to medium in body and a little more thin in texture.  You are also left with a mild alcohol burn.

Light-bodied; Strong funky corn and fake-malt notes with a lot of bread, yeast, fake sugar and stale funk noticeable throughout, with nothing enjoyable to catch and hold onto - this is purely off-putting flavours with a dash of yeast and bready qualities with some earthy and nut finishes that give it at least something else than the fake flavours. Aftertaste is dry, herbal and very funky throughout with a lot of nutty and earthy flavours, but the fake sugars and especially fake malts dominate in a bad and unsettling way. Overall, a very poor 'beer', but I suppose if you pretend to have some issues with handling glutens, this would be some alcohol; however, if you are in that category and pretend that you can't handle them, then just settle for something non-beer, please.

A little uncivilized for a lager on the uptake; I hope they don't tell unsuspecting customers this is like the pale lagers of american yore.

Perhaps I wasn’t in the mood for what in my opinion, is the worst style of beer, or perhaps it is just a bad Kölsch, as I have had many that are far better.. but either way, this marks the second beer on Beer With Us that was not finished, and ultimately poured down the drain.

6612,Hubbard's Cave Hazelnut Pot de Crème,1.9,"Niles, Illinois","Initial pour was milky light brown like a yoohoo, but as the rest of it came it was more like a traditional black stout.  Looked almost like chunks or hazies of hazelnut and chocolate floating, uncleared and unfermented.  

Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  

I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).

Smell: Subtly smoky roasted malts, dry chocolate powder. Dank, earthy, weed-infused hop character with a hint of supporting citrus.

Taste: Roast, mild chocolate. A strong dank, earthy, weed-like flavor tossed with Lapsang souchong immediately takes hold. Geez Louise, this is not a flavor profile I can make it through. I don't wish to have a contretemps with my fellow drinkers, but, whew, what a stinker.

Nice idea, but just too much of everything.  The aroma is surprisingly light, with some fruity and mango notes.  The flavour is straight up ruined by the seasalt.  I think there’s some mango and I get a subtle chilli heat, which is nice.  But it’s like someone threw some brine in the mix.

6674,O'Shea's Traditional Irish Stout,1,"Atherstone, Warwickshire","Review: 50cl brown bottle of O’Shea’s Irish Stout: 4.5% vol.

Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!

Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” 

On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. 

Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.

The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.

On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.

In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. 

Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.

Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!

It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. 
Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….",Drinking_77,Atherstone

If you have been to SouthEast Asia and you know the smell immediately when you enter a room (shop) that there is a cut up, WARM, durian lobe somwhere...this is that smell, somehow multiplied. Raw onions, rotting meat, funk, odd fruits and a spoiled pineapple on top of that mix - absolutely disgusting, and if I could give a negative aroma score, I absolutely would. The colour is pink, slightly violet and showing a faint off-white head that fades fast. Light-bodied; Strong fruit flavours show first with the stronger, meatier funk right behind with some durian notes, onion flavours and a dash of apples under those way more pungent notes. Aftertaste shows the funk and pungent meaty/umami notes that aren't good - just pure bad and nasty. Overall, if you can make it past the smell, the flavour is slightly better, but still insanely pungent and strong, in all the wrong ways. I absolutely love Graft ciders, but this was easily the worst drink I've had in a very long time, perhaps many years. I found it a challenge to make it through, and I did so almost as a joke, but I did NOT pour this out, that said, it was horrible to  make it through.

Bit of an off taste found initially, not great at all……….

Overall, it is a bit tasteless, and any taste you do get is bittersweet and lacking in flavouring.

Second can, it improved a little, and was slightly easier to drink, a bit smoother and nicer on the old stomach, but still lacking any real depth to the beer.

The looks of the beer are fine. It doesn't look too exciting. The beer has a slight pale golden yellow colour. On top some rough white foam is formed, but it ain't much and after some seconds all is gone besides a minimal drape. The beer is crystal clear.
The aroma of the beer is meh. It is simple. The malts give a grainy note, but the cheap corn flakes give it a cheap grain dust note. A bit nutty, but not that nice. The hops aren't very aromatic. There might be a zesty touch there, but not the 'lime wedge' that is promised. It is simple. Not a very entertaining drink.
The taste of the beer also ain't world class. Some sweet malts, some bitterness from the hops. The bitterness is a bit sharp. It isn't very bitter, but it doesn't feel completely harmonious. Could be better.

The taste was similarly sweet upfront with a lot of sugars but quickly turned bitter with some corn and cheap, almost off-adjuncts. There wasn't much to the beer really, with some artificial sugars seeing things out and the body was a very light with a thin feel that lacked balance too; terrible stuff and definitely one to avoid. ",flying_pig,Central Java

Taste is candied watermelon, with a Woodchuck-like aftertaste that is sort of like added distillate & sugars. Malic acid tartness. Watermelon juice here, cider is dirty. Crispy, slightly thick feel. Sulfite headache.

Not good. Swore I've rated this brand before & knew better.",MicroGrog,Austin

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is murky light to medium yellow.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean.

Light to medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Absolutely horrific aroma that is virtually nothing but off notes, most notably vomit. It honestly made my eyes water, one of the worst beer aromas I've encountered in the past several years.

7171,High Water West Meets East,5,"Chico, California","Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.

The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.

Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.

West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7182,Perennial Abraxas,4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri","On tap in Madison, WI

A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate. The results speak for themselves as this world class imperial stout delivers a product worth traveling or trading for.",Brigadier,St. Louis
7183,Northern Monk / By The River Northern Powerhouse Brew Series 2019 007,4.5,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!",LagerGuide122,Leeds

7188,Upland Paw Paw,5,"Bloomington, Indiana","Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. 

The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.

Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.

7189,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew.

Hennepin is, dare I say, ever but as good, and perhaps better than Saison Du Pont, THE saison. Hennepin's deep golden body floats a thick even bubbled white head that leaves plenty of lacing behind with each swallow. Toasted malt, honey, orange, meadow flower, ginger and white peppercorn dance in a complex melange that shifts and changes with each sip. Mildly sweet as it fades, spicy hops dart in and out, piquing the palate with earthy, herbal goodness. The carbonation is fairly high, but not overdone or brittle.

7211,Beachwood Blendery Dia De Los Mangos,5,"Long Beach, California","Attained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Dia de Los Mangos is a Belgian-style sour ale fermented and aged in oak barrels with mango, tamarind, and chili crafted by Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.

The scent of chilis and mango are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 6.8%.

Ancho chili greets you with a sweet spice on the take. Aleppo chili follows with a cayenne touch. Guajillo chili adds a smoky, berry like hue to the chili feel. Serrano chili provides a sharp earthy spice that deepens as the finish prolongs. Mango fairly sweetens the complexion, smooths the take, and slightly weighs the drink. Yellow chili assists with the sweet mango. A barnyard funk is notable with the juicy mango. Tamarind is vibrant in the earthy spice and lactic finish. Oak is sensible with the aleppo and guajillo chili characters. The chilis are tasted and felt when you licked your chops.

Dia de Los Mangos is a stunning Belgian-style sour ale. The bouquet of ancho, aleppo, yellow, guajillo, and serrano chilis along with tart tamarind and lactic yeast makes this beer a one of a kind. The mango makes this brew drinkable. The aleppo, guajillo, and serrano chilis ravishes the drink yet colorful. Tamarind, mangos, and ancho and yellow chilis provides a wonderful sweet tone. This is a spicy beer, yet it is pleasing for me but I have mention that I like my salsa hot and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this craft beer and enamored by the chili profile.

7219,Cloudwater / Track Love In The Dark,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Slightly ruddy very dark brown pour, practically black in the glass, with a very large yet very swiftly disintegrating head. Very prominent coffee aroma, with lurking sweetness. Thick, slick, smooth and chocolatey-sweet, with next to no carbonation. The fenugreek does indeed lend a herbal-cum-maple syrup effect to the beer as claimed, to go alongside the (lightly supported by hazelnut and vanilla) chocolate syrup. Coffee notes, however, develop primarily in the aftertaste. Absolutely gorgeous Imperial Stout, albeit (and perhaps because of being) totally unchallenging. 10% beer should not be this damn easy to drink! However, although it's powerful and delicious, from a strict artistic standpoint I'd like to see more depth and complexity from a double-digit ABV beer - which might also have served to keep the fenugreek in check; if there's any complaint I have with this it's that it's just a little more 'herbal' than I'd have made it. Still, this rates very, very highly. By far the easiest-drinking Imperial Stout I've tasted - might not bring all the richness and complexity some fans of the style are looking for, however, it's certainly not generic!",LagerGuide122,Manchester

7255,Freigeist Geisterzug Gose Quitte,5,"Stolberg, North Rhine-Westphalia","Acquired at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $10.99, Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a German beer brewed with spice and natural flavors crafted by Freigeist Bierkultur from Eitting, Germany.

The aroma of quince, rhubarb, coriander, and ginger are noted as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 5.2%.

Quince is fairly sweet, gives off a pear like hue, and tarts the take. Rhubarb imbues an acidic sour tinge to the tart comprehension. Coriander is soft and compliments the quince. Ginger is distinguishable in the finish at the back of the throat. Honey adds tone to the drink and tasted when you lick your chops. Wheat grains the mouthfeel and accompanies the pear and honey notes.

Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a delightful gose. Quince, rhubarb, coriander, and honey combine into a beautiful bouquet. The tart quince, sour rhubarb, and ginger spice dazzles the journey. The quince and honey smoothens the drink and eases the sour, tart, and spice experience. The centerfolds of pear like quince and green apple like rhubarb harmonizes magnificently. I treasured each drink and impressed by its colorful array of flavors.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7269,Evil Twin Who Wants Apple Pie?,4.5,"Queens, New York","7%ABV.   IPA

Tapped out cloud gold.  7°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of tart Granny Smith apples, and raw plain yogurt.

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with moderate carbonation.

Palate has flavors of unfiltered apple juice with sweet, fruity, tart, light astringency. 

Hop flavors are light sappy, and grassy at most.

Finish is clean, fruity, fresh.  There is no tart, no bitter, no lingering flavors except that of fresh apple cider.

Overall, a really smart expression of the juicy IPA with sour thrown in to offset the low attenuation, and the whole sweet fruity expression that is so often found in the hazy IPAs on tap today.  I really liked this one.  Likely one of my favorites of the evening.  Kinda nice way to finish the evening after 3 big Imperial stouts and a “stout wine”.",drjoeng,Queens
7270,Evil Twin NYC ET Found Home: Edition Scwartzbier,4.5,"Queens, New York","5%ABV.  Schwarzbier.   

Tapped out black.  40°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of smoke and wood, and clean malt. It was interesting to nose this next to the Evil Twin Imperial stouts at this tasting because it just highlighted to me how clean a schwarzbier smells. 

Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation.   Sparkling mineral water.

Palate has flavors of light roastiness with a thin charcoal bitter. There is a clean minerality to the palate. Light wheat toast.   There may be some DMS in the palate that suggests corn. 

Hop flavors are woody, minty, hint of resin. 

Finish is medium with a sappy, maybe even piney bitter.

7271,Evil Twin Perfect Nose Cognac,4.5,"Queens, New York","10%ABV.  American Barleywine   

Tapped out dark brown.  32°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of grape must, overripe grapes, cooking sake, ripe chiku or what is more widely known as sapodilla.  There are some pleasant strong alcohol references to pear and apple brandy.

Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. 

Palate has flavors of caramel, honeyed dates, molasses, fresh barley loaves, especially the moist hearts, hint of black bread, rye bread, and pumpernickel.

Hop flavors are woody, sappy, with a light pine resin.  The hop expression is a little more obvious on the palate.

Finish is medium-long with a resinous, pine sappy bitter floating on a cloud of alcoholic warmth.

Overall, a big bold expression of an American Barleywine style ale.  Good.  I’m still not sure I’d age this one, just because I quite like it as it is, a satisfying fresh strong ale.  The rough edges work, and I’m not sure I want this any smoother.",drjoeng,Queens

7277,"Other Half Droppin' Millibars - Cacao Nibs, Coffee, Peanut Butter and Vanilla",4.5,"Brooklyn, New York","13.2%ABV.   Imperial stout. 

Tapped out black.  40°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of earth, wood, fire.  There are elements of raw flour, wheat dust, dry hay as well which for me is totally attractive for a stout, which is so rare these days. It’s probably the PB2 that’s giving it the depth of earthy aroma. This is the aroma that suggest wet rotting logs, a compost heap, and fresh turned earth.  The nose has a bit of umami funk that suggest raw soy sauce. 

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with watered honey.  Low-moderate carbonation.  There is a bit of a carbonic tingle on the palate. 

Palate has flavors peanut butter and jelly.  There are herbal flavors suggesting licorice and lineament. There is nice base flavor peanut like a nice peanut butter sandwich or a Thai satay peanut sauce.  There are ample roasty flavors that suggest black coffee, espresso, charcoal and burnt ends.

Hop flavors are woody with a hint of pine resin.

Finish is surprisingly brief and clean with a hint of umami that suggests dashi, bonito flakes or soy. 

Overall, a big complex imperial stout that’s not like any other peanut butter concoction. This iteration seems to have gone umami, funky, and earthy instead of creamy, sweet, and boring.",drjoeng,Brooklyn
7278,Perennial Maman (2019),4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri","750 ml bottle from the brewery. Weird to change the blend so dramatically in year 6 of this beer. Pours a deep, dark, inky and basically opaque brown with virtually no head. The liquid leaves thick legs in the glass as it goes down, too. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, dark dried fruits, and molasses. Medium-full bodied, with low to modest carbonation and a sweet, slick, rich, warming, coating mouthfeel in great balance. It's great.

7305,Concrete Jungle Ume,5,"Los Angeles, California","Obtained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $4.99, Ume Saladitos is a sour plum gose crafted by Concrete Jungle Brewing Project from Ventura, California.

The fragrance of Lactobacillus yeast and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy gold and pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5%.

Plums flavors the body, sours the comprehension, and felt upon the mouthfeel. Lactobacillus delbrueckii adds a soft lactic touch and tarts the take. Mexican candy is noticeable with the Lactobacillus. Saison brightens the dry finish. Munich malt compliments the plum profile. Flaked oats are sensible upon the yeasty and plum mouthfeel. Himalayan sea salt adds a touch to the saison and Lactobacillus blend.

Ume Saladitos is a glamorous sour plum gose. The plums, Lactobacillus, Mexican candy, saison, Munich malt, and Himalayan sea salt combine into a delectable craft beer. Inspired by Umeboshi soda and Saladitos, the Lactobacillus delbrueckii and sea salt blend into a soda like tinge. The Lactobacillus delbrueckii gives off a yogurt like tone to the plum and saison body. The sour plum and lactic tart are fair and easy to experience. I prized every drink and dazzled by its complexity. The artwork is by Andrea Mendoza.

7327,Mother Earth Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout,5,"Vista, California","Attained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $10.25, Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout brewed with liquid cocoa and cocoa nibs is crafted by Mother Earth Brew Company from Vista, California.

The scent of cocoa, roasted malt, lactose, and mint are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 10.8%.

Liquid cocoa is rich, creamy, prominent in tone, and tasted when you lick your chops. Roasted malt lightly textures the mouthfeel. Cocoa nibs is tangible and compliments the roasted malt feel. Milk assists with the creamy liquid cocoa hue. Mint is strong from beginning to end and imbued with the liquid cocoa and milk complexion. Rye malt is distinguished as the finish drags on. A caramel, barleywine touch is discerned upon the mouthfeel in the finish. Oak applies a woodsy tinge to the liquid cocoa, milk, and caramel finish.

Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout is a luminous stout. The liquid cocoa, roasted malt, cocoa nibs, milk, mint, rye malt, and barleywine combine into an impressive interpretation of a mint chocolate stout. The barleywine, rye malt, and cocoa nibs provide a hair-raising finish. The liquid cocoa and milk blend delightfully together. The barleywine barrel aging is the highlight of this beer. I cherished every single drink and found an impressive beer beyond a variant of a style.

7342,Boulevard / Ommegang Collaboration No. 4 Saison,5,"Kansas City, Missouri","#OldHopsforOldPops special

Gifted for Christmas from Jenna and James Sepulveda (purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $14.99), Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a malt beverage brewed with spices crafted between Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri and Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York.

The smell of saison, rye, honey, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber with a half a finger of white head. When held up to light, a cloudy golden amber shows. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Saison is fairly sweet and wholesome to the complexion. Caramel malt textures the mouthfeel and light to the body. Honey blends well with the saison and caramel. Coriander compliments the caramel and honey frame. Orange peel is tangible with the saison feel. Lemon peel is subtle to the honeyed touch. Safir hops applies a tangerine hue to the saison and orange peel combination.

Rye fairly spices the take and the caramel comprehension. Grains of paradise softly peppers the malt body. Oats adds texture to the mouthfeel and easily picked out in the finish. Pear is drawn out in the finish followed by the honey. Perle hops express mint and evergreen notes that are vibrant to the pear finish. Clove provides an underlying tone to the minty profile.

Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a sensational malt beverage. The saison, caramel malt, honey, rye, orange peel, lemon peel, and Safir hops makes this beer a one of a kind. The caramel, honey, and rye blend beautifully together. The pear, honey, and oats work in concert well in the effervescent finish. My favorite aspect is how the spicy hops, rye, and grains of paradise interplay collectively. After being bottled in the summer of 2014 and aged for 5 years, the Perle hops give off a strong minty hue in the finish. I treasure every single drink and enamored by this brew’s complexity and depth. It is beer like this that challenges the notion how long should you age your beer.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The aroma of pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Pineapple is juicy and felt upon the mouthfeel in the dry finish. Grapefruit blends with the pineapple and fairly bitters the take. Oranges are discerned as the finish prolongs. Mango fills the body and smoothens the drink. Cantaloupe is noticeable with the watery aspect. 

Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is an appetizing American pale ale. The pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and cantaloupe come together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple and grapefruit dazzles the take. The light orange note compliments the cantaloupe. The double dry hop is barely noticeable until the dry finish. I enjoyed drinking this brew and found the pineapple dry finish to persist long after you drink it.

7392,Unibroue Trois Pistoles,5,"Chambly, Quebec","Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.

The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.

Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.

Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink.

The scent of pineapple and floral hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pineapple is juicy and offers a fair tart to the take. Motueka hops compliments the pineapple with a lime touch. Citra hops give off a mango hue to the pine complexion. Mosaic hops imbues a bubblegum flavor to the body. Raw oats are distinguished upon the mouthfeel in the finish. 

Hitchhiking Ghosts is an ethereal IPA. The pineapple and Motueka hops combination is the vehicle that takes us on for the ride. The bubblegum aspect is the figurative hitchhiker while setting the beer apart. The mango and bubblegum notes harmonize well with the raw oats. I loved drinking this craft brew and impressed by its creative, interpretive concept.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7418,The Bruery Bakery - Coconut Macaroons,4.7,"Placentia, California","Can version.  This is not a beer for pub drinking. Its not a beer for the football game. Its not a summertime cookout beer. There is nothing ""everyday"" about this beer. This is a full on, ""sip by the rustic fireplace for an extended period of time beer"". Its huge, full of bourbon character, resplendent with dark rich chocolate and toasted coconut, and packs a punch like an angry yak in mating season.  Beautiful oak, vanilla, coconut and chocolate ooze from the glass. A long chocolaty finish is helped along by a rising alcohol heat that warms all the way down. At 12.2%, its strong, but not overly hot. Rather, its rich, moderately sweet, and has tons of umami.  Decadent, over the top, but well crafted, and ultimately ""worth it"". Dont cheat yourself.

7430,2 Row Feelin' Hazy IPA,4.5,"Midvale, Utah","Had this last night (one of a six I purchased directly from the brewery), 2 Row's Feelin’ Hazy NE DIPA.  Unfiltered, to the point of noticeable chunks of yeast in the pour, which dissolve as the beer warms from the 38 degrees of my fridge.  Effervescent in the mouth, big hops (pine nuts, resin) on the start, but with a rounded, juicy, citrus finish.  Great balance of bitter at the start and very slightly sweet at the end. Hides its 9% very well because of its inherent drinkability.  It’s an excellent version of the NE style from a promising new Utah brewery. It may be in the Straptank Hazy league (a limited ed. from the talented Springville brewmaster), but since that beer has evolved into a legend in my mind, it’s hard for me to say. Regardless, the 2 Row NE is very, very good.",johngiolas,Midvale

7434,Brooklyn East IPA / India Pale Ale,4.5,"Brooklyn, New York","Bottle from supermarket in Copenhagen

Nice, deep-golden color. Hazy. Substantial, off-white head lasting several sips.
Nose is like a flower bouquet with a strong, slightly soapy, royal hops scent (something I've really come to enjoy).

Taste has notes of herbs, a not-too-synthetic flower petal sweetness and a very balanced hops bitterness that effectively hides any trace of ethanol. 

Medium body, soft and pleasant mouthfeel, medium fizzyness. A layered beer... One of the better ones. Have it with pizza.

7438,Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5,"Reno, Nevada","As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7481,Gulpener / Oedipus Flitspopper,4.9,"Gulpen, Netherlands","Eisbock de 7,5 % abv, qui est en fait un blend entre le vrai eisbock
de la maison Gulpener et une sour ale de chez Oedipus …
Deux remarques de principe à propos du style de la bière :
1 une bière de 7,5 % abv peut difficilement être un eisbock .. (Trop faible)
2 cette bière étant un blend avec une bière usuelle, ne peut en aucun cas
relever de la méthode de glaçage en intégral que requiert l'eisbock.
En clair, cette bière, pour ces deux raisons, ne peut être un vrai eisbock.
Juste un ersatz …
Au programme malts d'orge, de blé et d'avoine. Très bien.
Houblonnage … et dry hopping (étrange pour le genre, s'il en est ..)
Mon exemplaire, en format 30 cl,  était à 6 mois avant sa date.
(ce qui est ridicule pour un véritable eisbock … preuve supplémentaire !!)
Couleur roux clair, aux reflets orangés, et clarté nette.
Bulles très rares.
Mousse beige, en nappage fin à 1 mm.
Arômes de mangue, ananas, clémentine corse … 
(Un nez sympathique, mais, faut-il le signaler pour les néophytes,
qui n'a rien à voir - ou plutôt à sentir - avec un eisbock ...)
1ère bouche souple, avec un fruité à la mandarine, clémentine, 
et une légère pointe de zeste … très bien intégrée.
Arrière-bouche avec un côté pulpeux agréable, digne d'une neipa ..
2ème bouche avec des saveurs toujours agrumiques, très fines.
Arrière-bouche avec une légère nuance de torréfié, loin, très loin ...
Longueur aux belles nuances de neipa, avec une pointe d'acidité jolie.
Jambes fines, serrées, longues.
Levure fine, précise, belle ligne.
Alcool très bien, en fait, vu la mutation des styles .. il s'est adapté
avec un  double flip arrière pour travailler une neipa ..
Finale très délicate, avec une belle harmonie.
CONCLUSION : Gulpener, en voulant inventer le "" sour eisbock "" ..
a en fait inventé par le plus grand des hasards le "" neipa bock "" …
grâce à l'apport de Oedipus .. et son sour machin (en fait non sour).
Les flitspopper en savent grâce aux brasseurs, métamorphosés
en flitspopper lunaire une nuit de pleine lune … ce qui n'est pas 
vraiment une mince affaire .. mais tout à fait à leur portée.
Comme ils le disent très bien … "" verrukkelekkukkelijk "" ..
ce qui est intraduisible, sauf pour les martiens flitspoppiens …
Je voterai pour cette bière lors d'une élection flitspoppale ... 
N.B. Ma cote se réfère à une neipa bien entendu, et non un eisbock ..",corkyrory66,Gulpen

A dank and juicy IPA using Golden Promise, wheat and Cara Munich malts in the mash for a sweetly smooth body. For the hops we judiciously bittered with Magnum in the kettle followed by Citra T90 in both the whirlpool and in dry-hopping. The aroma/flavour is fruit-filled, dank and resinous, with plenty of tropical mango giving a moreish drinkability. Fermented with our house American ale yeast (WLP001) for a refreshingly clean finish, this IPA is also our first gluten-free beer using Brewers Clarex®.

 

This beer is vegan (keg & can only).

7501,Hoof Hearted Belloq American Stout,4.9,"Marengo, Ohio","Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Bulloq is an American stout with coffee and vanilla added brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.

The aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a minimal khaki head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Chocolate is light and smooth the drink. Vanilla creams and tones the chocolate complexion. Espresso bitters the take and flavors the body. Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and espresso combination. Roasted malt textures the mouthfeel and compliments the espresso. Char deepens and enriches the chocolate and roasted malt frame.

Bulloq is a luscious American stout. The chocolate, vanilla, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and char blend together into a ravishing beer. The chocolate, espresso, and char leaves a lasting impression. The caramel and espresso dazzles the chocolate and vanilla body. The roasted malt and char applies a tantalizing touch to the mouthfeel.

7517,Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5,"Boortmeerbeek, Belgium","Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The scent of pineapple and mango are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.7%.

Pineapple is juicy and has a pleasing tart to the take. Simcoe hops are discerned upon the cusp of the drink. Mango flavors the complexion yet lacks body and weight followed by a hint of lime. Centennial hops compliments the pineapple and assists with the bitter take.

1-800-TROPICS is a delightful unfiltered IPA. The pineapple and Simcoe, Mosaic, and Centennial hops combine into a delicious IPA. Simcoe and Centennial hops dazzles the bitter and pineapple take. Mosaic hops gleams the body and is the star to this brew giving off the mango and lime notes. The hop bitterness is moderate and drinkable.

7556,Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,"Stockport, Greater Manchester","Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The version I am having has been aged in Burgundy white wine barrels for 4.5 years. Amazing fruity nose similar to to the original and the unique edition versions. This one has a significant influence from the white wine barrels, adding a superb dry, aromatic note on top of the base beer aroma. Hints of fresh leather too. Modestly sweet, but not overly so. Somewhat viscous - I prefer a bit more bulk but it’s definitely not ‘watery’ or anything. Quite drying - lots of the white wine again, freshly baked bread behind it. A hint of sourness, presumably from the yuzu fruit, but this takes a back seat after all the years of ageing. Hops have practically vanished, least any bitterness that they may have had before. Overall this one is superb.",clongeron,Shepton Mallet

7583,Anchorage Anadromous Belgian Black Bier ,5,"Anchorage, Alaska","Purchased at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Anadromous is a black sour ale brewed with Summit hops and triple fermented in French oak foeders, Pinot noir, and whiskey barrels crafted by Anchorage Brewing Company from Anchorage, Alaska.

The aroma of chocolate, Pinot noir, whiskey, and fair Brettanomyces yeast funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark purplish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Black currants tarts the take and flavors to the drink. Pinot noir wine fills the complexion and is prominent on the dry, lactic finish. Whiskey adds a boozy undertone to the wine. Chocolate malt infuses with the wine and whiskey body. Toffee is light and compliments the chocolate. Figs are noticeable with the malt and boosts the malt texture. 

Plums are tangible with the toffee and yeasty combination. Brettanomyces yeast brings a leathery funk to the mouthfeel. Saccharomyces yeast brings out the chocolate while Lactobacillus assists with the tart punctuation. Summit hops spices the comprehension and adds onto the tart and lactic take. Oak applies a woodsy touch to the chocolate malt and Pinot noir wine feel.

Anadromous is a voluptuous black sour ale. The chocolate malt, black currants, Summit hops, and Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts sets this sour ale apart from the sour market. The spicy Summit hops, tart black currants, and lactic yeasts dazzles the take. The Saccharomyces yeast slightly sweetens the chocolate and toffee frame. The Pinot Noir wine gleams the complexion and is the focal point of the craft beer. The boozy whiskey makes this sour ale easier to drink. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its colorful bouquet of flavors. For the consummate sour beer fan, the tart and sour comes across as a 2.7 out of 5; and 3.4 out of 5 for a newcomer.

A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az ""imperial"" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival. Ebben az esetben tehát az ízek befogadhatatlanul sokszínű jellegéhez egy intenzív, mégis a kompozícióba kívánkozó karakter csatlakozik a kávé személyében, így téve megismételhetetlenül egyedivé az eleve speciális, önmagában sem mindennapi főzetet.",adster,Chicago

Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban.

Der Schaum ist recht dunkel. Der Geruch ist angenehm, Honig, mit säuerlichen und beerigen Noten. Das Bier ist weich, etwas säuerlich, etwas malzig, würzig, leicht schmalzig und recht blumige Geschmacksnoten sind vorhanden. Ungewöhnlich, aber wirklich sehr schmackhaft. Hat nix ""bockiges"" und würde fast als normales, gehaltvolles dunkles Weizen durchgehen. Lecker und außergewöhnlich.

Coole Bügelflasche, in 0,5 l und 1 l Ausführung. Bei der Literflasche bleibt die Kohlensäure etwas auf der Strecke.

Zur Verfügbarkeit: Gibt es nur direkt beim Hersteller, einem edlen Gasthof mit eigener Brauerei in einem Weiler kurz vor Bad Füssing. Der Weizenbock gehört nicht zum Standardsortiment des Herstellers und ist (wenn überhaupt) nur saisonal erhältlich.

7670,Kent Falls Coffeemaker,5,"Kent, Connecticut","Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $11.99, Coffeemaker is a Brettanomyces pale ale crafted in collaboration between Kent Falls Brewing Company from Kent, Connecticut and Sacred Grounds in Sherman, Connecticut.

The fragrance of saison, lemon, tangerine, and low funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours two fingers of white head. The alcohol content is 5.6%.

Saison tones the body and smoothens the drink. Tangerines fairly bitters the take and flavors the dry finish. Roasted coffee adds onto the bitter take and leaves texture at the back of the throat. Lemon brings a zest and tinge to the tangerine and saison frame. Brettanomyces yeast provides a dry hay funk to the body and layers a lactic tinge to the saison and citrus take. Wheat is sensible with the citrus zing.

Coffeemaker is a ravishing Brettanomyces pale ale. The saison, tangerine, lemon, roasted coffee, and Brettanomyces yeast deliver a color bouquet to this craft beer. The roasted coffee and citrus bitterness is beautiful. The lemon, saison, and lactic acidity dazzles the take. The tangerine finish is a cherry on top to the libation. I cherished every single drink and enamored by its depth and complexity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7671,The Bruery Bakery: Banana Bread,4.6,"Placentia, California","The Bruery's Banana Bread Imperial Stout starts with an impressive pour consisting of dark brown cloudy body capped with a towering tan head. Lacing is strong throughout and very resilient. Light overripe banana notes peek out behind stronger walnut and roast malt aromas. The flavors are less nutty and more bready with a good amount of chocolate and toffee taking precedence. The beer is sweet and ever so slightly tart at the end of each sip helping to keep balance. Vanilla and oak starts to rise mid glass. Overall, the bourbon is understated. There is no whiskey on the nose, and there is no burn. Banana Bread fills the palate without weighing too heavily on it, and is very creamy with a carbonation that crescendos in the middle of the swallow then tails off. This works exceedingly well to deliver a mild sweet nutty fade. Excellent.",freekyp,Placentia

Une mousse moka rocailleuse et pétillante recouvre un liquide brun foncé très clair aux reflets rougeâtres. La mousse descend assez rapidement. En bouche, le Bourbon s’installe dès l’entrée de bouche, se mariant ensuite à d’intenses notes de fruits noirs (pruneaux, raisins secs) avec un fond bien soutenu de toffee. L’équilibre alcool et fruité est parfait. On y retrouve également des notes de cerises ainsi que du chocolat. Le corps est pleinement rond et sa texture très veloutée.

7708,Toolbox Biere Du Nord,4.5,"Vista, California","Obtained at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $7.99, Biere du Nord is a saison refermented with Brettanomyces brewed by Toolbox Brewing Company from Vista, California.

The scent of saison, funk, and grassy hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a slightly hazy yellow that pours a two finger white head. Carbonation has a strong presence. The alcohol content is 6.7%.

Saison is bright and earthy to the complexion. Bouclier hops bitters the take, spices the yeasty comprehension, and adds a lemon hue. Clove adds tone to the yeast and slightly textures the mouthfeel. Brettanomyces yeast yields a musty grape like funk to the body.

Biere du Nord is a resplendent saison. The saison, Bouclier hops, and clove sets this beer apart from its style. The saison and Bouclier hops compliments each other. The carbonation and clove dazzles upon the mouthfeel. The spicy Bouclier hop and clove combination is my favorite aspect of this saison. I loved drinking this beer and impressed by its simple creativity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7742,Founders Underground Mountain Brown,5,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","24-12-2019; bottle; at the Swedish house (bought at Saveur Bière, #24 of Beery Christmas 2019). 
The looks of the beer are perfect. It looks delicious. The beer has a lovely dark ruby red colour, with a nice brown tint. It is dark enough to make it look like it is black. On top of the beer there is some soft tanned foam. Foam retention is low and hardly a drape is left on top of the beer. It kinda looks like coffee, creating a nice link to the Sumatran coffee used in the brewing kettle. 
The aroma of the beer is truly divine. It is so rich and full of aroma and flavour, intense. The nose is filled with everything and all at once. Harmonious. Where to start. First, malts. They are toasted and roasted, giving aromas of coffee, chocolate, some toffee and burnt caramel. Very nice and very rich. Some dried plums and red fruit hints are there in the distance. The coffee and chocolate aromas are enhanced by the added Sumatran coffee. Or the other way around; the coffee aroma is very pure and strong and it is more prominent than the malts. It is the main character in the aroma. The hops give the beer some nice herbal and leafy notes. Not to strong, but that is not needed in this beer style. This already is delicious and harmonious, but then the oak barrels kick in. Oak wood, some vanilla, lovely sweet corn Bourbon, some peat and smoke. It is al there, creating a very smoothing layer of aromas. It is one of the best oak barrel aromas I've had. It goes so well with the roast of the coffee and the malts. Devine. 
The taste of the beer is of the same pristine quality. It is soo smooth and balanced. Sweet malts with some sweet vanilla notes from the oak, roasted bitters from the oak and malts but also nice bitter hop aromas. Then there also are some delicate sours form the cask flora. This, together with the slight savouriness form the roast and toast, results in a perfectly balanced beer. 
The palate is just as genius. It is silk as smooth with a robust strong and full body. It has a creamy lining. Carbonation is low, but the nice hight alcohol warmth gives a good tingle. The finish of the beer is rich, full and aromatic. Filled with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak wood, some of the red fruits. It is incredible. Truly a beer worthy of being nr. 24 in Beery Christmas 2019. The best beer to end Christmas eve with. Cheers and merry Christmas.",Gangstergafje,Grand Rapids

7804,Propolis Prunus (11/13) ,5,"Port Townsend, Washington","Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.

The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.

Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

7836,Paradox Beer Skully Barrel No. 60 (B'aril Blood),5,"Divide, Colorado","Bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $16.99, B’aril Blood 2018 is a wild sour ale brewed with pomegranate juice and tangerine peels aged in oak barrels brewed by Paradox Beer Company from Divide, Colorado.

The fragrance of pomegranates, funk, and lactic yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber that pours a fast dissipating white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow hue shows. The alcohol content is 8.2%.

Saccharomyces yeast is sensible upon the cusp of the drink. Pediococcus yeast has an accentuated lactic tinge and butters the yeasty body. Lactobacillus yeast tarts the comprehension. Pomegranate juices the complexion and is prominent in the finish. Tangerine peels flavors the pomegranate character and easily distinguished with the water quality of the finish. Brettanomyces yeast adds a moderate funk to the body that grows as the beer warms. Lemon smoothens the drink and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic mouthfeel.

B’aril Blood is a mesmerizing wild sour ale. The colorful array of Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts to the pomegranate, tangerine, and lemon complexion is extraordinary to experience. The Saccharomyces and pomegranate fairly sweetens the beer. Pediococcus yeast is the highlight while making this sour beer easier to drink. The sour and tart are pleasantly strong for a sour beer fan; 4.2 out of 5 for a newcomer. I cherished every single drink and found an immersive brew in its complexity and depth.

Hints of caramel and whiskey and char on the long finish.,onceblind,Paso Robles
7841,Great Divide Hibernation Ale,4.5,"Denver, Colorado",From a can to a glass. Pours a mahogany dark red color with a huge tan frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is mocha and roasted malts and a ash charred malt note and tootsie roll candy. Taste follows the aroma with a slight earthy hop note and a slight nuttiness and toast. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Beer leaves awesome malt rings all down the glass. Awesome malty beer!,badpuppy69,Denver

7843,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","C’est une bière très bien équilibrée. Clairement, c’est un opéra dans le verre et dans le gosier. Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.",FrothyStave49,Giey-sur-Aujon
7844,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Le goût est riche et très équilibré, ce qui fait monter la côte de cette bière dans mon coeur. Cet équilibre se trouve dans l’entremêlement du malt, du houblon et de l’alcool. Cette richesse de gout s’équilibre également par la mousse, dense, qui rend de la douceur a l’ensemble. En arrière de cette équilibre, on retrouve les notes fruitées que l’on sentait au départ. Ce goût et surtout cet équilibre se prolongent tout au long de la dégustation.",FlightLegion58,Giey-sur-Aujon
7845,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Donc, je dirige le verre à mes lèvres, fébrile, et mes peurs s’évanouissent, une belle entame. Celle d’une vraie bière. Une bière amère, une force équilibrée avec un arrière-goût léger, doux, très légèrement sucré. C’est ce qu’on aime, c’est ce qu’on cherche.",BarleyChief51,Giey-sur-Aujon
7846,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","La bière est bonne, très bien équilibrée, le dosage est parfait. Simple à boire, elle a le gout de la bière (meilleure analyse du monde). Enfin d’une bière qui se laisse boire facilement et qui ne se veut pas forte et riche en gout. Nous avons un malt et un houblon assez jeunes qui laissent ce côté fraîcheur (chill) qui me plaît de plus en plus dans la bière.",MashForever56,Giey-sur-Aujon
7847,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","En bouche, cette bière est assez douce. Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.

A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.",YeastLees62,Giey-sur-Aujon
7848,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Dès la première gorgée, elle se savoure. Elle est très bonne d’entrée de jeu et c’est bon signe ! Le houblon est bien présent et elle est très fruitée, puis, le malt arrive en fin de bouche. Un goût complet et équilibré. En plus, elle est belle (« Vous avez vu ma femme ? Elle est belle hein ? Oui chef »), avec sa mouche bien blanche et plutôt dense pour une blonde. Au long de sa dégustation, accompagnée de la socca de René, évidemment, elle se montre légère et idéale pour accompagner la recette qui l’a inspirée !",CaskTasty56,Giey-sur-Aujon
7849,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Ce qui frappe d’entrée de jeu avec cette jolie blonde est son amertume. Elle est très présente, ce qui lui confère beaucoup de caractère. Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.

En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans. Et, ce petit goût floral vaut le détour.

On doit aussi noter qu’elle fait pas mal de dépôt, c’est bon signe : on boit de la vraie bière, pas pasteurisée et compagnie !",FrothyStave48,Giey-sur-Aujon
7850,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Vous le sentez ? Moi oui ! C’est le goût de la bière qui coule dans la gorge et la volonté qui reviennent. Revoilà cette sensation de fraîcheur, ses fines bulles qui pétillent telle une Badoit un jour de grand soif. Une résurrection. Tel le phœnix renaissant de ses cendres. La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble. On distingue la présence de blé, qui enrobe le tout. Et sur la fin, on remarque l’amertume typique des levures ajoutées à la mise en bouteille.",BeerSampler53,Giey-sur-Aujon
7851,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Pas besoin de vous faire un dessin, je la recommande. En ce moment je suis plutôt lassé des bières belges trop lourdes et fortes; mais en même temps, la radler c’est un peu light. Là, c’est le juste milieu.",FlightMaster61,Giey-sur-Aujon
7852,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Et ben c’est une super bière! Pour une bière de garde elle est plutôt douce, dû à son manque de houblon, mais c’est bien compensé par le goût de l’alcool.",BineMeister63,Giey-sur-Aujon
7853,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","La première gorgée apporte également une légère odeur de mangue mais la sensation de douceur s’efface et est remplacée par l’alcool, que l’on sent bien en arrière-goût et qui perdure mais sans être agressif. On retrouve donc bien une bière de haute fermentation. Les gorgées suivantes apportent de nouvelles touches, de petits arômes qui se dévoilent au fur et à mesure. On trouve donc des goûts de caramel et de réglisse qui se cachent derrière la note principale de malt.",MeadExports55,Giey-sur-Aujon
7854,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France",La mousse bien épaisse donne une superbe entrée en matière et quand on arrive au breuvage là c’est le pompon !

7855,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","C’est un peu complexe pour distinguer l’ensemble de ses saveurs, mais même pour des novices dans le domaine, elle se laisse apprécier. Son petit plus :  le sucre est rajouté à la mise en bouteille, ce qui permet de réactiver les levures. Là, comme ça, ça ne vous parle certainement pas mais ça veut dire que c’est une bière qui peut se conserver très longtemps et qui aura même tendance à changer de goût pour devenir encore plus puissante (et aussi avec un plus gros taux d’alcool).",KegChamp52,Giey-sur-Aujon

7857,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","A première vue, on sent ces levures. Elle se révèle assez maltée d’une part mais rafraîchissante, bien liquide de l’autre. En cette canicule ce n’est pas désagréable !
Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.

Elle sera donc parfaite accompagnée de bons plats de terroir ou des plats d’hiver, le genre de plat mi-patate mi-gras, 100% bonheur ! Elle vous comblera aussi en venant contrebalancer un fromage qui envoie, comme un vieux camembert.

C’est une blonde tout ce qu’il y a de plus basique. De fines bulles, un parfum de céréales et un goût de malt frais très agréable en bouche. Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer.

La première gorgée attaque par les arômes de céréales, en particulier l’avoine qui surprend. Rien d’étonnant si on a lu l’étiquette et qu’on sait ainsi qu’elle est faite à partir de trois grains, le froment, l’orge et l’avoine donc. Cette première gorgée est forte et les qualités de la bière sont difficiles à  distinguer, mais passée cette étape, elle devient bien plus douce et on peut apprécier tous les subtilités de ses arômes, assez uniques.",CaskMaster53,Giey-sur-Aujon

7869,The Church Saltwater Joys,4.6,"Wolfville, Nova Scotia","A great take on gose from The Church Brewing Co. in Wolfville, NS. This is an incredibly aromatic beer which goes down easily. Distinct notes of rhubarb and sour berries are the main stars of this beer, which provide the sourness as well as a hint of sweetness. There is also a saltiness in this beer which, surprisingly, pairs with the sour fruit notes quite harmoniously. Overall, an approachable gose that may sound a bit wild and eccentric, but that is definitely worth the try.",couscoussalad,Wolfville
7870,Scratch Blackberry and Lavender,4.5,"Ava, Illinois","500 ml bottle. Aromas of blackberry, lavender, vinegar, a sense of pie crust and cinnamon, but I don't think they were included in the recipe.

Perfect mouthfeel with near foamy carbonation. Delicious stuff.",poisoneddwarf,Ava
7871,Out of Bounds Powdered Toast Man,5,"Rocklin, California","Obtained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $7.99, Powdered Toast Man is a French toast inspired brown ale crafted by Out of Bounds Brewing Company from Rocklin, California.

The scent of maple syrup, doughy malt, and vanilla are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark reddish brown with a low vanilla head. When held up to light, light reveals a clear ruby red body. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Maple syrup is rich, sweet, and syrupy to the mouthfeel. Doughy malt tones and fills the maple syrup body. Vanilla colors and brightens the doughy comprehension. Cinnamon fairly spices the take and tangible with the maple syrup.

Powdered Toast Man is a delightful brown ale. The maple syrup, dough malt, vanilla, and cinnamon combine into a craft beer impersonation of French toast. The moment I tasted this beer, it reminded me of eating French toast as a kid. The maple syrup and doughy malt frame feels as if eating French toast melted in your mouth. This brew does not hint at all that you are drinking a beer; it tastes like breakfast in a glass. I thoroughly enjoyed this brown ale and it would be a go-to beer if I have the chance to visit the brewery on a regular basis.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Au nez le Bourbon est très présent avec des notes vanillées bien comme il faut. Derrière tout ça on retrouve un peu de chocolat, de caramel et de café. En bouche c'est épais à souhait. Là encore le Bourbon et la vanille dominent alors que le trio chocolat/caramel/café se partagent les restes. Pour autant elle n'est pas alcooleuse pour un sou.

En vista propone una corona de espuma amplia matizada de un tono canela y compuesta de perlas pequeñas a medianas, poca retención, el color del líquido ronda la escala más alta del SRM, sin transparencias un obscuro profundo. 

En aroma presenta notas a chocolate, pan quemado, café amargo, carácter a jerez, vainilla, un poco de frutos como ciruela pasa, ligeramente resinosa, la potencia es considerablemente fuerte, muy marcado el carácter de la malta. 

Ya en paladar es espesa, tiene un cuerpo pleno, sabores a frutos secos como pasas, café amargo, chocolate del mismo carácter, un poco de dulzor símil al caramelo, un poco terrosa, jerez, también vainilla, amargor pronunciado y casi al final toque resinoso, el alcohol genera algo de calidez en garganta y esófago pero es tolerable y aceptable en el estilo, final seco, regusto de larga duración, sin duda sigue siendo un buen exponente, me encantó y es justo como a mi me gustan las Imperial Stout.",Yased,Denver

7942,Nightmare Colombian Necktie,4.6,"Farmingdale, New York","Acquired at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $7.99, Colombian Necktie is a gose ale soured on mangoes with lulo, soursop, and Colombian lime zest brewed by Nightmare Brewing Company from Farmingdale, New York.

The air reveals soursop, lulo, and lime upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 7.2%.

Mangoes sweetens and fills the body, and gives the beer some weight. Lulo pines the complexion. A lactic tart softly sparkles the mouthfeel. Soursop provides a creaminess to the drink, sours the take, and adds a strawberry flavor to the comprehension. Lime brightens the mango and soursop composition. 

Colombian Necktie is a dazzling gose. The mango, lulo, soursop, and lime blend together into a delectable craft beer. The sweet mango and creamy soursop combination is the highlight of this brew. The lulo and lime compliments the mango and strawberry aspect of the soursop. The lime and lactic notes lightly accents the mango and soursop body. I loved drinking this beer and found it to be incredibly delicious.

Some lovely nuance and developing complexity on these flavours, even into the aftertaste. Thick but silky-smooth mouthfeel, roughness coming from the bitterness not the texture. A very nice sweet biscuit malt, hints of chocolate-chip cookie, but rarely gets a chance to shine through all the hops. Its contributions are splendid, however.

7971,Boulevard Smokestack Series: Grainstorm Black Rye IPA,5,"Kansas City, Missouri","#OldHopsforOldPops special

Bought at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $10.99, 2014 Grainstorm is a black rye IPA crafted by Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri.

The scent of rye, cocoa, pine, and citrus are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, brown shows at the surface. The alcohol content is 7.7%.

Roasted malt enriches the complexion and brings out the grains that follow. Barley is prominent and compliments the roasted malt. Rye is flush to the malt body and spices the comprehension. Cocoa deepens and broadens the barley and roasted malt profile. Mocha coffee accents the body and bitters the take. Caramel smoothens and underlines the drink.

Piney hops brightens and emphasizes the rye tone. Wheat is sensible as the pine imbues the mouthfeel. Grapefruit is distinguished upon the barley character. Tangerine is noticed as the bitter finish prolongs. An orange zest provides a tinge to the cusp of the drink.

Grainstorm is an extraordinary black rye IPA. The roasted malt, barley, rye, cocoa, mocha, and caramel blends amazingly in the body and livened by the grapefruit, tangerine, and orange zest. The barley, rye, and pine ravishes the take. Cocoa, mocha, roasted malt, and caramel harmonize well together and add depth to the beer. After contacting the brewery to establish when the beer I bought is bottled, the bottle date is February 2014. After being aged for five years, the hop experience is gentle and easy to drink; but still notable with the coffee bitterness. I treasured each drink and mesmerized by its complexity and depth. I have two more bottles that have been aged longer than this that is making me curious how it is going to come across.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8013,Delirium Nocturnum,5,"Melle, Belgium","Obtained at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $13.99, Delirium Nocturnum is a Belgian dark ale brewed by Brouwerij Huyghe from Melle, Belgium.

The smell of chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark brown with a finger of beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a reddish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Caramel flavors the body and smoothens the complexion. Chocolate compliments the caramel tone. Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel. Mocha accents and colors the take. Licorice spices the take and brings a lingering bitterness in the finish. 

Roasted barley infuses with the caramel and mocha notes. Plums rounds out the feel. Raisins slightly sweetens the beer and distinguished upon the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the body followed by a coriander touch. Honey sweetens the caramel and yeasty complexion and noticeably sticky when you lick your chops.

Delirium Nocturnum is a splendid Belgian dark ale. The caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, mocha, plums, and roasted barley makes this Belgian ale pop out from the Belgian market. The caramel base and tone reminds you of a Trappist ale. The brown sugar, mocha, and roast barley excites the caramel and chocolate comprehension. The honey becomes brighter as the finish prolongs. I cherished every single drink while the complexity and depth captivates our taste buds.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Maturation plus de 6 mois en whisky du Tennessee.
L'imperial stout a le grand avantage de vous faire voir les étoiles de plus près,

Couleur noir intense.
Mousse brun moyen en nappage et couronne soutenue à la paroi.
Arômes de café, terre et Tennessee whisky .. (of course, pardon ovni course ...)
L'apport du whisky sur le stout impérial de base (pour autant que l'on puisse
dire qu'un impérial est basique, mais je m'égare ..) est relativement forte ..
Longueur qui me fait penser que le Minnesota est quand même un peu loin
du Tennesse, qui est un état du sud … (mais je m'égare, si l'on peut dire …).

8044,Modern Times Neverwhere,5,"San Diego, California","Attained at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $13.99, Neverwhere is a tropical Brett IPA crafted by Modern Times Beer from San Diego, California.

The aroma of pineapple and funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a slightly hazy golden amber that pours a two finger white head. The alcohol content is 7.4%.

Pineapple pierces the body and gleams the mouthfeel. Mango juices and smoothens the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast provides a fluorescent funky tone. Citra hops adds a lime hue to the pineapple body. Pale malt is tangible to the mango and yeast composition. Chinook hops spices the take and adds to the pine character. Centennial hops are sensible with the pineapple feel.

Neverwhere is an otherworldly Brett IPA. The Citra, Centennial, and Chinook hops combine with the pineapple, mango, and Brettanomyces yeast into a mystical craft beer. The pineapple and mango sparkle upon the comprehension. The Centennial hops and pineapple blend together as the murky funk sets in. The pale malt and Centennial hops infuses with the pineapple profile accentuating the drink. I treasured drinking this beer and amazed by its complexity. This brew is part of a rotation; so, thankfully, it is not a one-and-done.

On top of the beer there is a nice layer of soft white foam. Foam retention is low-average. A nice drape is left on the beer. Noice.
The aroma of the beer is ver nice. It is quite aromatic. Most gluten-free beers I've had tend to be a bit mild in aroma. But not this one. The malts are nice and smooth, with some nice bready notes. There is a hint of caramel. The hops are intense. It has some lovely fruity citrus hop notes. Citrus zest, stone fruit like peach and some passionfruit. It is a juicy fruity bouquet. Very nice. 
The taste of the beer is also very nice. It is quite a sweet IPA. There are sweet malt notes and also some sweet fruit notes. The hops are nice and bitter, together with a nice sour fruitiness. It is well balanced. It isn't too sweet. The sweetness contributes to the juicy fruit juice aspect.
The palate of the beer is also quite nice. Medium body, smooth texture and also nice and creamy. Carbonation is medium. The finish of the beer is very nice. It has loads and loads of tropical fruits and juicy notes. It is amazing. The finish lingers on for a long time, inviting you to drink more and more. So many fruits.

8063,Green Flash Imperial IPA,5,"San Diego, California","Purchased at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $6.99, Imperial IPA is a western style IIPA brewed by Green Flash Brewing Company from San Diego, California.

The air reveals pine and herbal hops as you drink. The appearance is an orange amber with a low white head. Light reveals a hazy body. The alcohol content is 9%.

A bitter hop take greets you along with an earthy pine resonance. Grapefruit flavors the body followed by a mango hue. Evergreen lightly colors the hop profile and an anise like spice gleams the drink. A woodsy touch accompanies the pine, mango, and malt comprehension.

Green Flash Brewing Company’s Imperial IPA is delectable. The bouquet of Summit and Nuggets give off the flavors you experience. The pine, grapefruit, mango, anise, and woodsy feel blend together into a beautiful, bitter IPA. The anise like spice accentuates the hop bitterness. The hop bitterness is not as powerful as a Stone IPA, but strong to please a fan of the western IPA style. At room temperature, the evergreen and woodsy tone highlights the complexion. I loved drinking this brew and delighted by its vibrant hop profile.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8094,Golden Road Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse,5,"Los Angeles, California","Acquired at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a wheat ale infused with raspberries crafted by Golden Road Brewing from Los Angeles, California.

The scent of raspberries, lemon, and tequila are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a reddish purple with a low white head. When held up to light, a ruby red hue glows. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Raspberries fairly sweetens the complexion and lightly tarts the take. Lemon sours the comprehension while citrusy to the touch. Tequila smoothens and tones the drink. Wheat textures the mouthfeel and brings out the raspberries. Oak is sensible upon the tequila and raspberry blend.

Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a thrilling Berliner Weisse. The raspberries, lemon, tequila, and oak come together into a delicious craft beer. Raspberries and lemon provide a splendid interplay of sour and tart notes. Reposado tequila is discerned which compliments the raspberry and oak notes. The sour and tart are drinkable and easy to experience. I cherished every single drink and enthused by its depth. I would put this down as a bucket list beer.

8124,Rogue Farms Marionberry Braggot,5,"Newport, Oregon","Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.

The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.

Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.

Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.

Taste is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, with lots of coconut and chocolate; some coffee in there, maybe a hint of salt and nuttiness from the almonds, but they're kind of hard to pick out.

8138,Mount St. Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,4.5,"Coalville, Leicestershire","330ml glass bottle priced at £3.75 from Drink of Fulham.  Dated as best before 12/03/2021. Served having been out of refrigeration for around 30 minutes into a goblet. 

A beer I’m building up a lot and very excited about trying. Love the monks.

The beer pours a deep deep dark mahogany colour with plenty of sediment visible in the glass. Also, despite the dark colour carbonation is visible. The head peaks at around two fingers, varying sizes of bubbles but lots of big ones giving the head a rocky slightly loose consistency. Once dissipated down to a thick wedge worth the body of the head settles to become more consistent with a more uniform rigid appearance. The colour is that of caramel, before it becomes sauce.

The aroma seems deceptive once you have tasted the beer. Traditionally Belgian with yeast, sugar, malts. Fairly simple. On the sweeter side of the spectrum.

The taste is beautiful. Dark dried fruits, figs, rasins, yeast, high quality dark chocolate, very light liquorice. Burnt dark brown sugar, lactose. Complex but easy drinking. Up there with the best of the Belgian and Dutch Trappists. 

The mouthfeel is unremarkable. I’m writing this review the day after and can’t recall a particular aftertaste just that there was a hint of creamy lactose in coating the palate. 

Overall, an outstanding beer. Good enough the rival the Trappist big boys in my opinion while maintaining a truly English quality.",PubTun33,Coalville

8148,Mammoth 2015 Bluesapalooza 20th Anniversary Brett Ale,5,"Mammoth Lakes, California","Obtained at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, (2015) 20th Anniversary Brett Ale is a wild ale fermented with three strains of Brettanomyces yeast crafted by Mammoth Brewing Company from Mammoth Lakes, California.

The aroma of apricots, lemons, elderflower, and a fair Brettanomyces funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a slightly hazy gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6%.

Apricots flavor the body and juicy to the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast delivers a dazzling lactic touch after the take and adds a yeasty, funky comprehension. Lemon sours the take and tones the drink. Elderflower colors the yeasty and lemon notes. French oak is noticeable upon the funky, dry finish and tangible to the yeasty profile.

20th Anniversary Brett Ale is a resplendent wild ale. The apricots, three Brettanomyces yeasts, French oak, and elderflowers make this craft beer stand out from the sour beer market. After being bottled since 2015, the lactic tinge is sharp and punctuated after the cusp of the drink. Lemons compliments the lactic with sour and tart notes. The French oak becomes prominent over time and the highlight to the complexion. I treasured every single drink and impressed by its complexity. I ended up having a salmon dinner with this brew and paired beautifully with it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8169,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Latte Imperial Coffee Milk Stout,4.5,"Decorah, Iowa","Tall, thick, creamy-looking khaki head above a deeply black body. The head grows dramatically once the pour stops. The body is so deeply black you barely get any of the typical ruby edges with a backlight. The head has good retention, and leaves disconnected lacing. Gorgeous look in the Imperial tulip pint glass.

Strong coffee aroma, roasted coffee and malts, chocolate behind.

Wow! The mouthfeel is smooth, thick, creamy, but not quite chewy. A little carbonation contribution, but not much.

Taste is coffee-forward, rich, decadent, with chocolate and lactose. There is a slight bitterness in the finish that lingers in the aftertaste for a short while, but dissipates leaving a thick coffee and chocolate, smoothed with lactose, flavors to savor (although the bitterness does become a bit more pronounced in the aftertaste as the beer warms). No hint of the 8.9% ABV.

Overall, it has a very rich feel and flavor, slightly sweet but never cloying. An excellent sipping beer, decadent enough for an after dinner desert, but not as sweet as describing it as such might imply.  I love this beer.",MNAle,Decorah

Juicy juicy FLAVOR of tangerine, mango, pineapple, apricot, dank, honeysuckle, smooth oat-y malts, and other good stuff.  Low bitterness with a soft and creamy mouthfeel that really accentuates the hoppy juiciness.  Finding new Toppling Goliath beers makes coming to Iowa (somewhat) worth it.  And this was one I had long hoped to find.  Really fantastic stuff, expertly showcasing Citra and indeed the whole NEIPA style.  (379, 1156).",daleharshman,Decorah

8176,Stone Buenaveza,4.7,"Escondido, California","Attained at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $4.99, Buenaveza is a salt and lime lager brewed by Stone Brewing from Escondido, California.

The air yields lime as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow that pours a low white head. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

Lime is fair and vibrant to the drink. Salt is light and felt upon the mouthfeel. Pilsner malt brightens the complexion followed by a Vienna malt finish. As the beer warms, corn is distinguished with the malt composition.

Buenaveza is a sumptuous Mexican lager. This craft beer comes across as a plain Mexican beer, but this is an upgrade over a Modelo Especial or Tecate. It reminds me of making salsa, which I drink as I sample each batch I make. I enjoyed this brew and would gladly buy 24 packs of it. What I really want to do next is to make a Michelada with Buenaveza to see how it comes out.

Leaves plenty of brown lacing on the glass as you sip this deliciously sweet beverage.  Aroma of rich chocolate and cinnamon.  Some light roast as well.  Drinks sweet, like a beautiful cinnamon hot chocolate with some marshmallows floating in it.  Just enough roast to keep it from being a full on sugar bomb, but still this is damn sweet.  The mouthfeel is silk.  Just completely smooth, creamy, and a little rich.  Finishes slightly sticky, which totally works here.  It should honestly be illegal to hide 13.5% this well.  How often is a 13.5% beer burn free and easy drinking?  Good lord, this is dessert beer at it's best.

This is listed as a 7th anniversary brew, barrel aged imperial chili stout.  Adding my rate here until I can really get down to the fine details.  Jet black pour, dark brown cafe foam head.  Dry chili heat over a creamy chocolate.  Flavor has a slight bite to it, which I want it to have.  Its smooth in the middle, but intense on the edges.  Lovely.  The chocolate and chili combine beautifully.  Some cherry notes mixed in.  The heat is perfect.  The ultimate dessert beer for the pepper fanatic.  Its wonderfully warming, the barrels are inpressionable, and dont over or underwhelm the chocolate or chilis.

8224,Coachella Valley / Rock's Brewing Coriolis Effect,5,"Thousand Palms, California","Purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, Coriolis Effect is an Imperial Wet Hop India Pale Ale crafted in collaboration between Rocks Brewing Company from Alexandria NSW, Australia and Coachella Valley Brewing Company from Thousand Palms, California.

The fragrance of citrusy, tropical, piney, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a clear reddish amber with a low white head. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

The wet hop Amarillo hops provide a watery grapefruit sensation to the complexion. Caramel malt textures and flavors the body. Cantaloupe is pungent to the caramel and grapefruit frame. Lemongrass gleams the grapefruit and pine notes. Mandarin oranges compliments the plum and grapefruit blend. A combination of plum and cherry adds a dimension to the comprehension. An earthy, sweet accent colors the caramel feel. Dill flavors the lemongrass and grapefruit characters. 

Coriolis Effect is a beautiful Imperial IPA. The symphony of flavors from the Australian and New Zealand hops, Rakau, Wakau, and Motueka, along with Sorachi Ace hops and Amarillo wet hops are voluptuous to the drink and provide a moderate bitter take. The caramel, grapefruit, lemongrass, and mandarin orange harmonize handsomely together. The plum, cherry, and mandarin orange excites the drink. The lemongrass, dill, and pine dazzles the citrus base. I treasured every drink as the hoppy composition delivers a complex and flavorful libation. The wet hop helps set this IPA apart from such a popular style.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Taste matched the nose with additional notes of bourbon, vanilla, and molasses.  Sweet tasting with nice finish that does not overpower.

8231,The Kernel Imperial Brown Stout London 1856,5,"Bermondsey, Greater London","Très belle maîtrise de la part de la brasserie The Kernel pour cet Imperial Brown Stout à l'équilibre sans faille et aux arômes de café, chocolat et caramel, intenses et pleins. Une véritable petite gourmandise qui se déguste lentement. Noir total en verre, sans mousse et avec une faible effervescence, nous sommes dans les codes du genre. Le nez présente d'agréables arômes avec une dominante chocolat/noisette agrémentée par du café et du caramel. L'attaque présente un équilibre sans faille, une belle amertume donnant ce qu'il faut de fraîcheur, un alcool à 9,1 % pour mon exemplaire structurant bien la bière, soutenant les arômes et donnant du caractère et un malt intense et dense. Du côté des arômes, le café prend l'ascendant avec du caramel, de la noisette, une pointe pimentée et un chocolat qui se fait plus discret. Excellente corpulence avec en seconde bouche des arômes qui enrobent parfaitement le palais. L’arrière-bouche, davantage sur le chocolat et sur une amertume racée et herbacée, tranche et donne un excellent contraste. Le final, long, nous laisse sur un beau café expresso, racé.

8236,Cloudwater A Wave In The Marlborough Sounds,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","Pours a hazy, orange coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and bright, juicy hop aromas of citrus and stone fruit, with notes of orange, grapefruit and peach, as well as just a hint of peppery spice. Taste is a perfect balance of light biscuity malt and vibrant, juicy, slightly acidic and quite dank hops, with citrus, stone and orchard fruit notes of orange, grapefruit, peach and a hint of gooseberry as well, with just a hint of pine and peppery spice coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness and some dank, citrus hops and lighter pine and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Soft, pillowy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

A fantastic New England Pale Ale with some incredibly vibrant hop notes and full body and mouthfeel for the ABV. Very complex, yet with a perfect balance of sweet, juicy, dank and bitter notes. The dank citrus and stone fruit notes are really complemented perfectly by that typical, dry and somewhat acidic, peppery NZ hop character of white grape and gooseberry here.

8244,Almanac Emperor Norton Tripel,5,"San Francisco, California","Acquired at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $9.99, Emperor Norton is a Belgian-style Tripel brewed by Almanac Beer Company from San Jose, California.

The scent of Belgian yeast, grapefruit, pine, and hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is an orange amber that pours a finger of white head. When held up to light, the color shifts to a cloudy gold. The alcohol content is 9%.

Apricots are juicy and pungent to the body. Belgian yeast is earthy, spicy, and creamy to the mouthfeel. Hallertau Blanc hops bring a gooseberry like accent to the bitter take. Citra hops flavors the complexion and ventured throughout the drink. Peaches follows and compliments the grapefruit. Lemon slightly sours the take and serves as an undertone.

Biscuit malt blends well with the Belgian yeast. Caramelized malt sweetens and glistens the creamy and malt base. Pine glistens the Hallertau Blanc hops and lemon aspects to the beer. Clove peppers the take and adds tone to the yeasty comprehension. Coriander is soft to the Belgian yeast hue. 

Emperor Norton is a succulent Belgian Tripel. The dry hopped Citra and Hallertau Blanc hops, apricots, Belgian yeast, biscuit and caramelized malts, and lemon blend wonderfully together. The biscuit malt, caramelized malt, and Belgian yeast are tasty and dazzling to the drink. Coriander, clove, lemon, and Hallertau Blanc hops deliver a complex comprehension. The pine, lemon, and peaches brighten the hop profile. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. This is a one of a kind Belgian Tripel at a reasonable price.

It has a unique skinny can, with the same 12 Fluid Ounce amount of beer tasting goodness as it’s opposing brews, while still having a one of a kind taste that can only be described as “Yeah that’s a Michelob alright, can I have another?”",bigdickivan,St. Louis
8273,Bud Light Lime,4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri","The Bud Light Lime has a quality lime taste and is one of my favorite beers. It has a taste resembling a Corona with its lime, and makes the other lime tasting beverages seem shitty, like the White Claw Natural Lime. For a man who enjoys his Beer, this will always be a go to for me.",bigdickivan,St. Louis
8274,Stone (Berlin) / Jägermeister Arrogant Bastard,4.7,"Berlin, Berlin","At my niece’s birthday party, Jimi Sepúlveda shared Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard, a strong ale brewed with herbs, fruits, and spices crafted by Stone Brewing from Berlin, Germany.

The smell of pine, grapefruit, caramel, and evergreen are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a brownish amber that pours a finger of beige head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Star anise provides a long lasting bitter spice to the comprehension. The hoppy bouquet compliments the bitter take. Caramel brings a smoothness to the body. Pine glistens the caramel and citrus composition. Jagermeister tones the mouthfeel and imbued with herbal notes. Evergreen is prominent from beginning to end. Thyme is sensible to the Jagermeister and caramel blend at room temperature. Grapefruit and oranges delivers a citrusy tinge to the drink. Oranges become pungent in the dry and bitter finish. 

Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard is an otherworldly strong ale. The star anise, caramel, pine, Jagermeister, evergreen, thyme, grapefruit, and oranges come together into a unique craft beer. The Jagermeister and evergreen gleams the caramel and spiced body. Grapefruit and oranges are vibrant on the nose as soon as you pop the cork. At room temperature, the  tart orange and Jagermeister interplay amazingly. I treasured each drink and impressed how well the Jagermeister blends with the Arrogant Bastard. As off base as Jagermeister and a beer together can seem, harnessing it with an Arrogant Bastard works. My father and Jimi contributed to this review.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8308,Goose Island Brasserie Noir,4.9,"Chicago, Illinois","Bought at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $19.39, Brasserie Noir is an imperial stout aged in Cabernet barrels for up to 12 months crafted by Goose Island Beer Company.

The aroma of chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of tan head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark brown shows. The alcohol content is 11.8%.

Chocolate is fair and harmonizes with the roasted malt frame. Molasses thickens the body, enriches the chocolate, and tasted when you lick your chops. Mocha bitters the take and textures the mouthfeel. Vanilla is creamy and brings out the plums used. Figs are noticeable as you go into the finish. The Cabernet flavors the mocha finish. Red currant adds a slight tartness to the brown sugar and coffee bitter take. Oak is distinguished upon the molasses and malty composition.

Brasserie Noire is a tantalizing imperial stout. The chocolate, molasses, mocha, vanilla, plums, figs, red currant, and Cabernet combine into an extraordinary craft beer. The molasses and mocha ravishes the take. The vanilla provides a domineering creaminess that makes this libation drinkable. At room temperature, the Cabernet becomes the highlight to the complexion. I treasured each drink and dazzled by its depth from cold to warm. I think the best serving temperature is at room temperature. At 11.8% and a 765mL bottle, I shared this beer with my father who corroborated in this review.

Well worth getting 4 for £6 at supermarkets of this ale. It's a huge favourite anyway, but the ultimate experience would be on a cold winters afternoon with perhaps a bit of fog and ground frost, taking a bottle into rural country fields and savouring it.

8338,Libertine Wild Coffee Stout,5,"Morro Bay, California","Obtained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $21.99, Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a coffee stout fermented and barrel aged in French oak barrels brewed by the Libertine Brewing Company from San Luis Obispo, California.

The air yields acidity, lemon, Brettanomyces funk, and chocolate upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a finger of beige head. When held up to light, the surface shifts into a dark brown hue. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

A lemony, citrus body greets you with a sourness on the take followed by a lactic mouthfeel. Cherries sweeten the complexion and adds a tart to the take. As the lemon mellows, chocolate malt provides a discernible texture to the comprehension. Roasted malt accompanies the chocolate. Lactose brings a light, silky tone to the malty base. Espresso accents the chocolate and lactose while slightly bitters the comprehension. Brettanomyces yeast dries and funks the lemon and cherry finish. French oak delivers a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic bouquet.

Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a ravishing coffee stout. The lemon, cherries, chocolate malt, lactose, espresso, and funky Brettanomyces yeast blend amazingly into a one of a kind beer. The combination of sour, tart, and acidity is easy to experience and beautiful to the malty frame. The lactose eases the drink. The espresso and French oak are dazzling to the malty feel. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity. In the end, this brew is more sour than stout, so be informed before buying this bottle.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8351,FiftyFifty Imperial Eclipse Stout - Knob Creek Rye Barrel,5,"Truckee, California","It's black, with a very firm, persistent and lacey tan head. Gorgeous. Strong vanilla, whiskey and chocolate on the nose. Lot of toastiness, roast-bitter but also sweetness and molasses. Vanilla and whiskey take over, they go through chocolate, dark fruits, figs and spices, lingering in the after taste. It's a beauty to sip, thick and viscous, with a whisky throat & esophagus burn that dies in a warm explosion of flavours. For sofa sessions. Outstanding!",colui72,Truckee
8352,Russian River Shadow of a Doubt,4.5,"Santa Rosa, California","Pours opaque brown with a chocolate chip cookie sized ring of head. Cocoa,roasted malts ,toast dominate the aroma.

A nice head about two-three fingers if poured quick. Head retention is moderate, eventually fizzles out after 5 mins or so. A lovely aromatic citrus full of hops aroma. The taste is very citrus hop dominated, am guessing they have used on their own or in combination,citra, cascade,  chinook and amarillo hops in large quantities, this hoppy beer is perfectly balanced though with a sweet fudge malt background. Make no mistake, this is a heavy full and sweet beer, the sweetness is unavoidable at these abvs, due to the unfermentable maltodextrin sugars typical of a heavy abv beer.  But its all finely balanced and very drinkable, this is like taking brewdogs triple ipa and putting it on steroids! Overall a very pleasing and warming beer.",coltsr2,Manchester

8376,Dust Bowl Twisted Monk,4.7,"Turlock, California","Attained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.50, Twisted Monk is a Belgian-style abbey ale with cherries crafted by Dust Bowl Brewing Company from Turlock, California.

The scent of caramel, cherries, and Belgian yeast are noted as you drink. The appearance is purplish and clear that pours a minimal white head. When held up to light, a reddish purple glows and reveals tiny particles of sediment. The alcohol content is 7.7%.

Cherries bring a domineering flavor to the body and lightly tarts the take. Caramel is smooth and soft in tone. Belgian yeast creams the cherry and caramel complexion along with an earthy and spice touch to the comprehension. Toffee is drawn out from the Belgian yeast profile. Plums are distinguished from the yeasty and caramel finish. Dates add another sweet touch to the cherries.

Twisted Monk is an enticing Belgian-style abbey ale. The cherries, caramel, toffee, Belgian yeast, plums, and dates come together into an illustrious drink. The cherries and dates do not come across too sweet and gives the complexion a nice touch. The Belgian yeast and toffee combination brings a lovely tone to the malt and cherry frame. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast integrates handsomely with the tart. I loved drinking this beer and mesmerized by its complexity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Faint smokiness and leather add depth, warming alcohol finish.  Red wine notes emerge as it warms and touch of sherry / vinious.

8389,Prairie Bomb!,4.6,"Tulsa, Oklahoma","Avec son piment pour le relever, et ses fèves de cacao et ses grains de cafés pour lui donner de l'intensité cet Bomb est assez détonante. Force et caractère caractérisent donc cet Imperial Stout qui se déguste lentement. Elle possède juste un peu trop de sucre à mon goût. En verre, la bière est d'un noir total, quasiment sans effervescence. Le nez est plein, sur le chocolat, le café, le piment, la vanille, le caramel et des accents de noix de coco. L'attaque présente de suite une intensité remarquable. L'amertume, avec 65 d'IBU, permet de conférer une bonne fraîcheur pendant que l'alcool à 13 % donne de la chaleur tout en soutenant convenablement les arômes. Les 13 % ne se ressentent pas réellement, l'alcool étant bien intégré. On retrouve les cocktails présents au nez avec un piment que j'aurais préféré un peu plus atténué. On continue ainsi en deuxième bouche. Le piment donne quant à lui chaud aux papilles en arrière-bouche. Pas de réelles évolutions aromatiques toutefois. La corpulence est par contre assez exceptionnelle. Bel étirement sur le final avec des arômes qui restent longtemps n bouche. Merci à Vincent pour cette découverte.",jybi,Tulsa

The sweet, high gravity (boozy) aroma jumped out of the bottle after I opened it and became much and became more fragrant after I poured it into an English Pub glass. It’s a very dark, opaque stout with a thin tan head.

8404,Tahoe Mountain Primrose,5,"Tahoe City, California","Purchased at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $13.99, Primrose is a hybrid ale aged in oak barrels and blended with Northern California Malbec grapes brewed by Tahoe Mountain Brewing Company.

The smell of Malbec grapes, Brettanomyces funk, and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a purplish red with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.8%.

Malbec grapes have a ravishing, flavorful hue to the body. Brettanomyces yeast follows the fruity grapes with a soft funky touch along with a lactic tart tinge to the mouthfeel. Plums rounds out the body before the beer starts waning into the dry finish. Lemon provides a light citrus feel that compliments the lactic yeast and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the yeast, grape, and lemon frame.

Primrose is an exquisite hybrid ale. The Malbec grapes, funky Brettanomyces yeast, plums, and lemon blend together into a spectacular craft beer. The Malbec grapes and funk harmonize tastefully. Plums brings a fullness to the wine-like Malbec body. The sour and tart are easy to experience and pleasant to the complexion. I absolutely loved drinking this beer. The blend of wine and beer is exemplary. This is an outstanding craft beer; do not pass this up if you manage to find it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8423,Mount St. Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,4.6,"Coalville, Leicestershire","Toute bière Trappiste est toujours un événement. Et d'autant plus lorsque les moines nous offrent un tel breuvage. Une chose est certaine, il y a du belge dans celle-ci. Les moines anglais ont dû prendre quelques conseils auprès de leurs frères belges. Bonne complexité, beaux arômes de fruits et de malts grillés, bonne présence en bouche. Cette trappiste possède de nombreux points forts. Je ne vois qu'un seul bémol pour qu'elle soit splendide, un alcool, à 7,4%, quelque peu limite pour soutenir parfaitement les arômes. Visuellement, c'est une robe brune qui se présente à nous. Une fine couche de mousse nappe la surface. Le nez est sur la prune, la poire, la mélasse, le chocolat, de légères épices et l'alcool donnant un trait de caractère. L'attaque est sur un excellent équilibre avec un alcool faisant un peu plus que son titrage. On y retrouve des arômes fruités (poire, pruneau, banane), alliés à des arômes de chocolat, de caramel et un poivre relevant le tout (ce dernier étant peut-être un brin trop présent). L'alliance est remarquable. La deuxième bouche gagne en intensité tout en devenant un peu plus douce (c'est à ce moment qu'un alcool un peu plus élevé aurait pu être appréciable). L’arrière-bouche est en deux temps, un fraîche amertume en premier laissant place à plus de douceur. Joli final long sur une dominante chocolat, pruneau et caramel. Cette bière est digne des trappistes. J'attends un potentiel grand frère à 10 % avec grande impatience.",jybi,Coalville

8425,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","The beer was purchased in a four pack of 12 oz bottles. Dark brown body had ruby highlights when held up against light. The head was brown, and one finger thick. The beer was lightly carbonated, and the head disappeared shortly after pouring. The aroma was rich, with coffee beans, toffee, and chocolate being the predominant smells. The taste had an incredible depth to it, as the flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and caramel were in perfect harmony. The alcohol content was generously warm. This was definitely a slow sipper, as the sweet aftertaste lingered on and on after swallowing. The body was thick, rich, and coated every corner of the mouth. So glad to have finally found it on the shelves locally. The cost is pretty high at around $24 a four pack, but when you want the best, you have to pay.",rajendra82,Grand Rapids

8483,Clown Shoes Coffee Pecan Pie Porter,5,"Boston, Massachusetts","Obtained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.00, Pecan Pie Porter is an American Imperial Porter crafted by Clown Shoes Beer.

The air yields chocolate, espresso, and lactose upon the nose. The appearance is black that pours a low beige head. When light reflects off of the beer, a dark mahogany hue shows. The alcohol content is 8%.

Chocolate is soft and rich to the complexion. Lactose smoothens the take and creams the comprehension. Caramel fairly thickens the composition and glistens the lactose mouthfeel. Espresso flavors the chocolate and lactose body and slightly bitters the take. Pecan laces and accents the chocolate and espresso frame. Cinnamon is sensible with the espresso and pecan notes. Honey malt sweetens the beer and tangible with the caramel.

Pecan Pie Porter is a delectable American Imperial Porter. The chocolate, lactose, caramel, espresso, and pecan combine into an incredibly delicious beer. The lactose makes the beer incredibly light and tones the chocolate profile. The caramel and honey malt combination comes across syrupy. Pecan is prominent from the start into the malty finish. I loved drinking Pecan Pie Porter and discovered an alluring craft beer. This is really good and offers an immersive complexity to the drink.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Seasonal Wildflower Wit is back! A follow-up to the Elderflower Wit in the springtime, the brewer will continue to release this style each season, combining local & wildcrafted ingredients to subtly enhance a classic style.  Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village of Hoegaarden, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. Inspired by their creation, our brewer freshly foraged sumac to put into the kettle, alongside lemondrop hops, and dried lemon peels.

Très joli nez sur les fruits jaunes, les céréales, la levure, la coriandre et un alcool donnant un bon pep's.  Superbe attaque parfaitement équilibrée, avec un alcool soutenant bien les aromes, sans dénoter toutefois, ni être agressif, et avec une pointe d'acidité citronnée conférant un peu de fraîcheur. On y retrouve le cocktail découvert au nez. C'est à la fois ample et pêchu. La deuxième bouche est plus intense avec un alcool qui y est un peu plus chaleureux tout en restant bien intégré. Deux légers petits bémols lui font perdre le coup de cœur. Un petit poivre légèrement trop présent allié à une petite aigreur en arrière-bouche. Joli final, long, stable et ne perdant pas en arômes.

The aroma is of dark roasted coffee and chilies along with dark roasted malts cinnamon vanilla all capped off with a enticing aroma of chocolate and cocoa nibs. The flavor is very cinnamon forward along with the chocolate and coffee with accents of chili peppers vanilla cloves and nutmeg there’s a slight toasted earthy almost smoky flavor from the peppers.

This beer was purchased at the brewery on 8/28/19. Jen Kimmich told me it was packaged on 8/26/19. Staying the night in Stowe, the Best Western Hotel stored the 4.5 cases (Don't ask what I spent. I have an understanding wife who does not drink any alcoholic beverage.) in their food refrigerator. Mary, the manager, understood that The Alchemist beers need to be stored cold. Reminds me of what Coors did before going national. Many thanks to Mary and a desk clerk whose name escapes me.

The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a dense white head that remains thick and laces.The nose is tropical fruit with a little grapefruit and with slight piney resin. Body is light medium. Mouthfeel is well rounded with no crisp notes. Taste is tropical fruit, smooth malt structure with a hint of sweetness with light bitterness in the aftertaste. It has a great balance in common with Heady Topper. Using a word from another of their beers, it is Luscious as the little brother to Heady Topper.  Drinking fresh makes a difference. 16 oz can

Palate has flavors of toast, bread crusts, toasted grain.  Overall, the malt backbone is clean grain without much else, soft, and pronounced without being full.

Hop flavors are herbal, minty, hint of wood and forest-y.

Finish is clean with a light herb-like minty bitter.

Overall, a really good style example.  Always pleasant, glad to have put this down in writing finally.  Enjoying a good Bavarian lager is like enjoying roots cuisine, it’s sometimes nice to appreciate what a well-made basic beer tastes like again.",drjoeng,Munich

Body is massive, medium carbonation, with a very smooth, slick mouthfeel as its goes down. Taste is a battle between sweet and herbacious/savoury. Lemon, orange, mango, coriander versus pine and liquorice, some coconut cream from the Sabro with a tingling faint bitterness. Reminds me of a Thai green papaya salad, or maybe I'm just hungry?!

Poured into wide snifter. Like any Speedway variant - this beer is best served around cellar temp at 53-55F. Frothy 2cm burgundy colored head capping off the typical Speedway darkness. The aroma is unreal...soft coffee bean, blueberry muffin, dark chocolate, raisin bread and pancake batter. Damn fine, damn fine. Coffee on the flavor seems restrained compared to stock Speedway, but I’d need a side by side comparison to verify. Great depth with loads of chocolate and roasted malt. Medium to elevated acidity on the finish which does (slightly) negatively impact the palate. Strong bitterness with a lasting cacao musk in the soft palate after each sip. Above all else the aroma here was outstanding. Another little taste of nirvana from the Smithy. Amidst all of the expansion, saturation and loss of rarity in the San Diego craft beer scene in the last 10 years, the Smithy still continues to deliver the greats.",hapjydeuce,San Diego

8648,Cellador Ales Apricot Berlinerish,5,"North Hills, California","Attained at Handy Market from Burbank, California for $16.99, Berlinerish is a Berliner Weisse style ale bottle conditioned with honey brewed by Cellador Ales from Los Angeles, California.

The fragrance of apricot, lemon, red wine, and funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 4.6%.

Apricot is juicy and fairly thickens the body. Lemon tones the drink and sours the take. Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts smoothens the complexion and delivers a soft lactic feel. Red wine glistens the dry, funky finish and grows as the finish drags on. 

Orange blossom honey flavors the apricot and lemon frame and tasted when you lick your chops. Oats compliments the yeasty and apricot composition. Floor malted wheat textures the lemon, Pilsner malt, and lactic mouthfeel. Oak offers a woodsy tinge to the wine and yeasty characters.

Berlinerish is a delectable Berliner Weisse. The apricot, lemon, orange blossom honey, Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts, and oats combine into a one of a kind craft beer. The lactic yeasts sparkle with the lemon and apricot body. Spelt is sensible with the malted wheat, Pilsner malt, and oats. The highlight is the orange blossom honey and red wine blending together in the finish. The sour aspect is easy to experience yet sour enough to please a sour fan. I cherished Berlinerish as each drink brings complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

8649,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier,4.9,"Bamberg, Bavaria","Schlenkerla's entire lineup is exceptional, but Lentbier is the pinnacle of old world German craft. A unfiltered malty masterpiece, the aroma swirls between deep breadiness, caramel malts, fireplace smoke and yeast. The smoke is right there at the front of every quaff, but despite its strength, leaves room for the malty character to take center stage. The clean long smoky semi sweet fade ebbs away allowing just a nip of spicy hops to arrive just in time to lend balance. I find myself wanting to take huge gulps, to fill every corner of my mouth with this mahogany magnificence. Scenes of black forest lumberjacks carving through ancient beech trees in a darkening twilight during the high medieval period are entirely appropriate for this session. This beer takes you on a journey. Amazing.",freekyp,Bamberg

8668,Naked River Squatch Watchin' Wheat,3,"Chattanooga, Tennessee","Very malt-forward for an American wheat ale, with an outsized toasted bread and caramel backbone overshadowing the more gentle grassy, fruit-tinged notes of the style. Hints of lemon and orange backed up by mild floral hops offset the malt, but it's hard to find much balance or nuance. Not bad, but not what you'd expect.",oobawa,Chattanooga

8672,Phase Three Pixel Density,3.4,", Illinois","On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.",tmoreau,

8798,Vintage Snazzy Pants,3.3,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic. As a result it is hard to recommend this unless you really need to rate everything on the menu.",Brigadier,Madison
8799,Vintage Grain Train,3.8,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy oak, vanilla, and earthy almonds transition to a profile of dry sherry. The soothing warm finish glows on the back of the throat. The hops accent a well balanced experience that might be the best draft at Vintage right now.",Brigadier,Madison
8800,Vintage Vapour Trail,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A typical New England style IPA, this polished example of the style stands out as a drinkable and accessible version that can help further understand the thought behind it. I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness. From start to finish it provides a hook that shines the stage light on a polished release. Drafts like this show that Vintage is not resting on their laurels.",Brigadier,Madison

8802,Vintage Crandaddy,3.5,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tart cranberry lined with salty Sour Patch Kid sugar scour the tongue clean. The texture becomes more abrasive over time as it lingers in the throat. Compared to others it might be somewhat pedestrian but it does enough to be a worthwhile experience.",Brigadier,Madison

04-02-2020; bottle; at home (bought at de Bodega, Capelle Aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. 
The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.",Gangstergafje,Ertvelde

Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.

9030,August Schell Stag Series Nordic IPA,4.2,"New Ulm, Minnesota","Fruity aroma: pineapple, citrus - perhaps orange? - tropical fruits.

Color is cloudy burnt orange (brighter with a backlight) and a good level of fine carb bubbles rising to a tall, slightly off-white bubbly-thick head. The head recedes fairly quickly, leaving great-looking strings of lacing around the glass. After just a few minutes, the head is a cap with mounds of thick bubbles.

Taste is different; taking me a bit to characterize it. The pineapple and tropical fruits from the aroma are there, and strongly so, but the taste at the forefront is interesting, very nice and enjoyable, but hard for me to describe (I checked some other reviews - they were no help... maybe it's just me...) 

It is a good tasting beer, despite my lack of words to describe it.  There is some cracker malt presence behind the fruit flavors. A moderate bitterness begins a few seconds after each taste, that grows stronger and lingers into the aftertaste. This is not WC IPA level of bitterness, or even a Midwest IPA level, but more than sufficient to meet expectations for an IPA. The bitterness grows as you drink the beer.

The mouth feel has a solid body with decent carbonation.

The finish is semi-dry.

Overall, a very good IPA.",MNAle,New Ulm
9031,Boelens berrevoesj,2.3,"Belsele, Belgium","Gekregen van mijn nicht op 30-09-2019. En thuis geproefd op 25-01-2020. 
Berrevoesj wordt gebrouwen voor biercafé Berrevoesj in Liedekerke, het is ook een bijnaam die Liedekerke heel lang geleden kreeg omdat de inwoners in die tijd te arm waren om schoenen te kopen, ze moesten dan ook ‘berrevoesj’ (blootvoets) door het leven.
Het is een wazig-blond biertje dat veel wit schuim produceert in een romige vorm wat sterk aan het glas blijft kleven. Je ziet maar weinig fijne CO2 belletjes omhoog parelen. Het schuim zakt naderhand in elkaar tot een fijn laagje van iets meer dan 1 mm dikte met wat grove bellen tussen.
HET AROMA:
Fruitig met op de eerste plaats citrus en dan wat pompelmoes en mout.
DE SMAAK:
Wat hopbitter, citrus en mout
HET MONDGEVOEL:
Volle body met een licht-stoffige textuur en een normale koolzuurprikkeling.
DE NASMAAK:
Vloeit uit en de hopbitterheid blijft toch lang hangen.
HET TOTAALGEVOEL:
Op zijn manier een harmonieus biertje.
HET VERDICT:
Geen geweldig biertje, het is vooral het lichtbittere dat hier de show wil stelen maar na een tijdje wordt die smaak wat wranger. Het lijkt me dat het bittere (IBU 52) hier door iets anders wat getemperd wordt.

9214,Incendiary Under The Trestles Belgian Tripel,3.5,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","UTT is anything but subtle.  This heavy-handed Americanized version of the style ups the ante in every sense of the word. Tons of banana and yeast esters are where it starts. Sweety bready pale malt character starts to take over mid sip. It winds up with a vegetal smack of spicy hops and aggressive wash of carbonation, then a pretty hot alcohol finish. It's good, but is completely lacking in the subtlety of the original style.

9219,Incendiary Lemon Wit,4.3,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Incendiary hits it out of the park on this one. I love this beer. While it's not the prettiest (dull maize with zero head), this ugly duckling has a lot of great qualities. Classic coriander and wheat cracker nose dosed with an aggressive fresh lemon zest on top. The flavors really pop with a long wash at the end of each swallow intensely adding its character to the mix and lifting the bright lemon zest to the forefront. The absolute perfect summertime beer.
",freekyp,Winston-Salem
9220,Incendiary Night Shift,3,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Night Shift is a seriously weird beer. Points for uniqueness, though it doesn't completely work. The nose is old bong water filtered through charred chicory wood and evergreen needles. Intense oily Mosaic hops lend a bit of motor oil aroma, which is pushed down by the intense woodiness of the Midnight Wheat malt bill. It's a fun beer to power through, if not completely enjoyable.

The almond flavor is a little too subtle in comparison to the other components to truly give a rainbow cookie experience, but it's on the right track. Still, a pretty good sweet stout, and one that hides the ABV fairly expertly.

However there is life underneath the sourness... a nutty fudgy nougat coffee slab is in there. The miasma cannot hide it entirely as tendrils reach for the surface. Light bodied. Thin but slick. Flat. Uber face smashingly (clearly I exaggerate) astringent finish. I like.

9578,Gypsy Road Lawnmower Light ,3.3,"Kernersville, North Carolina","Adam lays down a skillful light American lager that can bridge the gap for non-craft beer drinkers. For those that are used to craft, its still a fine choice on the lighter side. Lawnmower is a pretty golden pour, crystal clear, with a resilient small ring of pure white head. Its really nice to look at.  Mild honey and delicate hop florals play well together. Its clean, light bodied, and crisp. It's also better than 90% of the beers in this style. Well done.",freekyp,Kernersville

Smells of lemon acidity, strong grassy hops, some garlic hops, and brett.  Tastes of lime tartness up front, some doughy pale malt, sour citrus, and earthy brett notes.  Oak is light for Odd Breed, but the finish has a lingering woody flavor.  Surprisingly soft carbonation, considering the foamy bottle.  Chewy body.  I was hoping for something less sour when I read about this.  It's good, but the tartness seems to be the dominant flavor.  It doesn't let the malt profile or hops come through quite as much.",ctipping,Pompano Beach

9587,Source Ultra Samba,4.2," Colts Neck, New Jersey","16 oz can from the brewery, 1/30/20.  Canned 1/27/20, so pretty damn fresh!    The pour is unclear, golden-orange, with a white head that leaves some moderate, drippy streaks of lacing on the glass.  Bright, slightly tart pineapple, some mango and apricot as well.  Quite tropical.  Juicy, but not overly sweet.  Has a tang and a spice to the finish.  Quite good, and shines even more as I get toward the end of the can.  Seems as though I am pretty much the only person left on this site enjoying beers from this brewery, but judging by the crowds the rest of the NJ beer crowd likes them as much as I do.  Looking forward to enjoying and /or sharing with others the rest of my cans from this release.

Yellow pour, nice white head. Something very odd happens when I first taste this beer. It's warm. Or rather, it feels warm. It's straight out of the fridge, and I double-check the bottle temperature. Cold. But it tastes warm. It's so soft and full on the palate without any thickness, stickiness, or richness that it feels like a cask ale. I have no clue how TF they do that. But ok...First sip is a bit sweet, a bit herbal. Chardonnay. Saison loveliness.The palate acclimates. How do you slow down on this beer? It's amazing. A guilty pleasure for the fancy saison set, but so much pleasure and so little guilt. Not a beer I'd bring to tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the subtly of my palate—but totally a beer that I'd bring to a tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the fact that I've got my f'n ear to the f'n rails.

Pours oranged tinged gold with a fine, foamy white head. Aroma is sort of pineapple strawberry. Med body or close. Flavor is very different from my familiar flavors.

Decently bitter. Worth drinking.",bhensonb,Paso Robles

9673,Idle Hands Craft Ales Splitter,3.9,"Malden, Massachusetts","Interesting stuff. Pours a murky dark golden with big white cap that fades to a skim and leaves some lacing. Aromas are foremost Belgian esters along with some melon and dark fruits. Flavors differ from nose with more emphasis on ripe fruit but still some banana and melon.

9674,Three Taverns Hop Leaf Project Transcendo,4.2,"Decatur, Georgia","Pours hazy apricot with a thick and fairly persistent porcelain head. Aroma yields resiny hops and sweet citrus that reach out and touch you from half a meter away; as you close in, hops get more piney, citrus gains a little tartness, and fresh malt makes an appearance. Flavor lays out piney and slightly bitter hops, tangy and sweet citrus with tropical character on the side, and crisp fresh malt. Texture provides good, smooth body and lively fizz, plus a hoppy and fruity finish. Transcendo ordinary beer!",Cybercat,Decatur
9675,Desert Valley Big Stout,3.3,"Albuquerque, New Mexico","Taster at the Craftroom. Near black pour, persistent creamy head. Aroma is almost non-existent.  Taste is both sweet and roasty, which converts to bitternes at the finish. Malty, cola.",stevoj,Albuquerque

9697,Union Corners Eau de Currant,3.4,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

The final pour of the night was something unusual - a fruited brut kolsch. I generally enjoy the dry nature of brut beers. The additional flavors manage to transform it into a release that stands out from the typical kolsch.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A bubbly colored body radiates with fruity currants and dry textures that   sets itself apart from the usual brut kolsch or IPA. Rather than a bone dry texture of champagne it layers on top a creamy fruit.

FLAVOR / PALATE
The blend of black currant and champagne transform this from the typical brut beer to a dark slightly chewy experience. While still very drinkable it definitely is transformed by the addition of dark fruits. While not my usual choice it does try something new without being a total disaster.",Brigadier,Madison
9698,Union Corners Joie de Vivre,3.4,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A playful Belgian influenced IPA takes things in a different direction than the usual release. While it still contains that trademark candi sugar it also adds a more malty tone than most. With releases like this I'll be sure to pay more attention to Union Corners in the future.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A cool base the color of melted chocolate rests under a creamy vanilla head. The laid back core emits waves of malty yeast and candi sugar - almost like an Elephant Ear chased by iced tea. It then melts almost immediately into the background.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Driven mostly by a malty core the blend of iced tea and yeast warm the tongue. A cool texture grounded in mellow sun tea then melts on the throat. There's less bitterness than originally expected though it does enough to be memorable. I'd happily drink a full pint if there were not other options.",Brigadier,Madison
9699,Union Corners Seneca's Reserve,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A creamy regional stout shines with promise from first impression to the last sip. I was not sure what to expect at first but it grew on me until I seriously considered ordering a full pour. If this sits around until my next visit I may do so.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Creamy oatmeal cookies soaked in soft fruity coffee warm the air with a gentle nose that soon fades away. The fluid black base dances freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky coffee chased by a spoonful of oatmeal transition gently to a finish of dry cereal. The balanced finish lightens the mood before melting into a cool maltiness. A great benchmark for the brewery as a whole, this well executed stout should give you an idea of whether Union Corners is in your wheelhouse or not.",Brigadier,Madison

9769,Beau's Night Märzen,3.5,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","Super crisp bright copper and light amber coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall off-white and tan head. Aroma of bright toffee, earth, grain, caramel, biscuits, deep yeast and a heavy hand of toast and pure malted barley. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grainy and earthy flavours throughout with a small but noticeable dose of alcohol, toffee, caramelised sugars, some peat and a bit of nuts and softer grassy notes at the finale. Aftertaste shows a more defined biscuity, grainy and earthier side of things with a bit of an off-balance between the malt (heavy) and hops (not very noticeable), however the body itself is good for the style and showing things about right, but seems to miss a good deal of complexity from the lager yeast instead of an ale yeast (which is naturally to be expected for the style), but it seems noticeable that this is good but lacking a touch. Overall, a decent beer with a good profile and biting malt and peat flavour that really shows through, especially at the end. I sampled this twenty ounce (one pint, four ounces) Ontario-styled bottle (slim and narrow) purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 02-December-2017 for US$3,99 sampled at home in Washington on 06-July-2018.

Really pleasing toastiness.",asheft,Vankleek Hill
9828,Beau's Night Märzen,3.8,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","My Bottom Line :  
This malt lover’s Märzen serves up bread crusts, lightly burnt sugar and chewy barley on a most elegant palate.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the translucent pale amber.
-Soft carbonation and lean residual sugars combine for a easygoing, cuddly mouthfeel.
-Hops are timid throughout. A touch of wooden bitterness in the finish, but that’s it.
-Again, beautifully developed soft malt character in this Beau’s lager.
