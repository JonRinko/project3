It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA.

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA.

      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Aroma of dark chocolate, chocolate orange, light roasted malt, caramel, coffee, dried fruit and a touch of liquorice. Medium sweetness and light to moderate bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Very nice.\n",
      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n"

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish.

      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",
      "Bottle from the no-longer-open Brewklopedia, Leicester. Hazy and slightly pinkish yellow with the tiniest ring of white head. Nasal passages are slightly burned by the intense tartness to the aroma. Lemon juice, raspberry, intense mothball funk. Amazing mouth-puckering taste. The sourness fills the whole mouth and longer a long after the sip. More lemon and tart berry in the aftertaste. Medium to heavy carbonation. Special.\n",

      "Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.\n",

      "Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end.

      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA.

Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Very nice.\n",
      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n"

Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA.

Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge.

      "Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation.

Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Very nice.\n",
      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",
      "Bottle from the no-longer-open Brewklopedia, Leicester. Hazy and slightly pinkish yellow with the tiniest ring of white head. Nasal passages are slightly burned by the intense tartness to the aroma. Lemon juice, raspberry, intense mothball funk. Amazing mouth-puckering taste. The sourness fills the whole mouth and longer a long after the sip. More lemon and tart berry in the aftertaste. Medium to heavy carbonation. Special.\n",
