0,The Bruery Sucré (Portuguese Brandy),4.5,"Placentia, California","75CL, acquired in 2014 and forgot I had it. Finally opening February of 2020. ""will age for decades"" so let's see :) Dark reddish color, had a 7-up kind of carbonation when I poured it. can smell sweet syrupy brandy from a few feet away. maple syrup, baked apples and cinnamon aroma. wow, this has blended and aged so well. soggy oak, burnt sugar, vanilla, bible paper, ice cream, candied sugar and more apple. little bits of cherry and lovely smokey flavor with an oily grain alcohol finish. Easily the best of the anniversary beers.",AdamChandler
1,De Dolle Stille Nacht,4.7,"Diksmuide, Belgium","Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.",sakimori
2,High Water West Meets East,5.0,"Chico, California","Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.

The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.

Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.

West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

3,Les Trois Mousquetaires Stout Impériale,4.7,"Brossard, Quebec","750-ml caged and corked bottle purchased at the brewery in Brossard, Quebec, Canada. Pours pitch black yet with the tiniest bit of mahogany hightlights, along with a trace of brown head and lots of clingy lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate, dark dried fruits, smoke. Flavor: espresso, milk chocolate, campfire marshmallows, prunes, raisin bread, date bars, figs, molasses cookies, burnt toast; perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel: full-bodied with a velvety smooth, creamy yet oily finish.",shawnmurphy
4,Hill Farmstead Genealogy of Morals - Coffee (Akmel Nuri) - Rum,4.5,"Greensboro, Vermont","Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours black-brown with a foamy, beige head. Luxurious and delicious, with lots of layered chocolate character, a bit of chocolate sauce, ripening dark fruits, subtle roast, creamy-sugary coffee. Full bodied, oily and lightly chewy, with fine carbonation. Softly warming finish, almost a little sticky, more more decadent chocolate character, raisins, mellow earthy bitterness, more dense fresh coffee. Has an obscene amount of depth. Makes for a great sipper. Delicious.",Leighton
5,Beamish Irish Stout,5.0,"Cork, Ireland","""il solito"" al pub che frequento di più era la Beamish. Una birra che non ti stanca mai, leggera di gradazione, dissetante, ne berresti litri!
Ottima stout Irlandese ""caffelattosa"", con schiuma spumosa (spillatura ad azoto).
Per il mio gusto, superiore alla ""sorella"" ben più famosa e diffusa.",flogisto
6,Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.5,"Chico, California","Absolutely delicious. The hoppiness of Torpedo is toned down, but the results are oh so fascinating once this subdued IPA bitterness is coupled with generous barrel aging. The bourbon notes provide a lovely baseline, while subtle grapefruit, orange, and pine notes play off the vanilla and wood from the barrel. Texture's dreamy in its supple smooth feel; ABV's a nonfactor. Just a frickin' amazing beer.",oobawa
7,Deschutes The Abyss - Brandy,4.6,"Bend, Oregon","3.5 yrs aged. Black pour with a foamy thin tan head. Rich darkly sweet aroma with notes of brandy and plum and raisin and dates.

Lingering roasty and gently earthy finish.",onceblind
8,Stone Viking Space Probe Double IPA ,4.5,"Escondido, California","Had on tap at Tenaya Creek, this was delicious. Quite hazy, a ton of grapefruit flavors with a little orange.

9,Primal Lawn Boy,4.5,"Huntersville, North Carolina",An American Lager with no bitter aftertaste. Clean but not overpowering Lemon and Ginger flavor. A Light & Crisp finish. Doesn't weigh you down.

11,Cascade Sang Royal,4.5,"Portland, Oregon","2016 Edition: Dark fruit, woody oaky, lactic sour aroma and flavors. Deep plum date and raisin aroma and flavor with tannic oaky and a Cabernet like red wine finish.  Sour maybe 5 or 6 of 10. All lactic/acetic.  Complex dark red wine flavors with the dark fruits are great.  Really delicious and complex.",Mep3222
12,Spencer Trappist Ale,4.7,"Spencer, Massachusetts","This one was surprising to me.  It's essentially the perfect sessionable Belgian styled amber ale. Awesome spicy Belgian yeast backed by strong caramel malt is the main flavor and aroma component. A nip of raisin and cotton candy. Lightly sweet, very malty, but well in balance. This would pair with any pub grub. Nice substantial chewy mouthfeel that lightens as it fades. A modern masterpiece from the only Trappist brewery in North America. Impressive.",freekyp
13,Perennial Abraxas,4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri","On tap in Madison, WI

A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate. The results speak for themselves as this world class imperial stout delivers a product worth traveling or trading for.",Brigadier
14,Northern Monk / By The River Northern Powerhouse Brew Series 2019 007,4.5,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!",LagerGuide122

16,Lakefront Black Friday (2017),4.8,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin","First of all, boozy af. You can really taste the bourbon. Along with that is vanilla and an earthiness I associate with fresh tobacco. A dark, complex beer that you practically need to chew, the mouthfeel is so thick and smooth, like a Dove bar. One of my absolute favs, though I cant handle more that about 8oz at a time - that ABV is no joke",stilladyj

19,Upland Paw Paw,5.0,"Bloomington, Indiana","Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. 

The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.

Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

20,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!",saltyseadog

22,Sierra Nevada 40 Hoppy Anniversary Ale,4.5,"Chico, California",Sierra Nebmvada really knows how to celebrate an anniversary. Their 40th IPA is truly a victory of brewing. It's a balanced affair that channels their west coast pedigree while still delivering interest and quality. A solid light malt backbone lifts an impressive resiny piney hop bill that is both familiar and engaging at the same time.  Nice long hoppy finish that still manages to avoid rindiness. Quite clean. Awesome lacing too. This is why they are the west coast kings.,freekyp

30,Bell's Hop Grandslam,4.6,"Comstock, Michigan",This is a heavy hitter. %10 IPA VERY hoppy but the aroma is the most inviting thing. Taste isn exceptional and almost deceiving for such a high percentage. Notes of eccentric citrus and bitter but not to the point of undrinkable. You really have to take your time with it and allow your pallet to have a break in between sips to really appreciate what it has to offer.,CrowHardly
31,North Brewing Co Big House Waltz,4.6,"Leeds, West Yorkshire","Wow this is damn good.

32,Ommegang Hennepin,4.6,"Cooperstown, New York","One of the old guard of American craft brewers, Ommegang's artful delivery of Belgian styles is truly on par with many of the European MVPs that served as their influence. Hennepin is, dare I say, ever but as good, and perhaps better than Saison Du Pont, THE saison. Hennepin's deep golden body floats a thick even bubbled white head that leaves plenty of lacing behind with each swallow. Toasted malt, honey, orange, meadow flower, ginger and white peppercorn dance in a complex melange that shifts and changes with each sip. Mildly sweet as it fades, spicy hops dart in and out, piquing the palate with earthy, herbal goodness. The carbonation is fairly high, but not overdone or brittle. A modern classic.",freekyp

42,Beachwood Blendery Dia De Los Mangos,5.0,"Long Beach, California","Attained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Dia de Los Mangos is a Belgian-style sour ale fermented and aged in oak barrels with mango, tamarind, and chili crafted by Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.

The scent of chilis and mango are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 6.8%.

Ancho chili greets you with a sweet spice on the take. Aleppo chili follows with a cayenne touch. Guajillo chili adds a smoky, berry like hue to the chili feel. Serrano chili provides a sharp earthy spice that deepens as the finish prolongs. Mango fairly sweetens the complexion, smooths the take, and slightly weighs the drink. Yellow chili assists with the sweet mango. A barnyard funk is notable with the juicy mango. Tamarind is vibrant in the earthy spice and lactic finish. Oak is sensible with the aleppo and guajillo chili characters. The chilis are tasted and felt when you licked your chops.

Dia de Los Mangos is a stunning Belgian-style sour ale. The bouquet of ancho, aleppo, yellow, guajillo, and serrano chilis along with tart tamarind and lactic yeast makes this beer a one of a kind. The mango makes this brew drinkable. The aleppo, guajillo, and serrano chilis ravishes the drink yet colorful. Tamarind, mangos, and ancho and yellow chilis provides a wonderful sweet tone. This is a spicy beer, yet it is pleasing for me but I have mention that I like my salsa hot and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this craft beer and enamored by the chili profile.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

50,Cloudwater / Track Love In The Dark,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Slightly ruddy very dark brown pour, practically black in the glass, with a very large yet very swiftly disintegrating head. Very prominent coffee aroma, with lurking sweetness. Thick, slick, smooth and chocolatey-sweet, with next to no carbonation. The fenugreek does indeed lend a herbal-cum-maple syrup effect to the beer as claimed, to go alongside the (lightly supported by hazelnut and vanilla) chocolate syrup. Coffee notes, however, develop primarily in the aftertaste. Absolutely gorgeous Imperial Stout, albeit (and perhaps because of being) totally unchallenging. 10% beer should not be this damn easy to drink! However, although it's powerful and delicious, from a strict artistic standpoint I'd like to see more depth and complexity from a double-digit ABV beer - which might also have served to keep the fenugreek in check; if there's any complaint I have with this it's that it's just a little more 'herbal' than I'd have made it. Still, this rates very, very highly. By far the easiest-drinking Imperial Stout I've tasted - might not bring all the richness and complexity some fans of the style are looking for, however, it's certainly not generic!",LagerGuide122

86,Freigeist Geisterzug Gose Quitte,5.0,"Stolberg, North Rhine-Westphalia","Acquired at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $10.99, Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a German beer brewed with spice and natural flavors crafted by Freigeist Bierkultur from Eitting, Germany.

The aroma of quince, rhubarb, coriander, and ginger are noted as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 5.2%.

Quince is fairly sweet, gives off a pear like hue, and tarts the take. Rhubarb imbues an acidic sour tinge to the tart comprehension. Coriander is soft and compliments the quince. Ginger is distinguishable in the finish at the back of the throat. Honey adds tone to the drink and tasted when you lick your chops. Wheat grains the mouthfeel and accompanies the pear and honey notes.

Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a delightful gose. Quince, rhubarb, coriander, and honey combine into a beautiful bouquet. The tart quince, sour rhubarb, and ginger spice dazzles the journey. The quince and honey smoothens the drink and eases the sour, tart, and spice experience. The centerfolds of pear like quince and green apple like rhubarb harmonizes magnificently. I treasured each drink and impressed by its colorful array of flavors.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Smoky notes atop the caramel start to appear as I sip. Dark fruits. Some currants. A nip of fennel.

100,Evil Twin Who Wants Apple Pie?,4.5,"Queens, New York","7%ABV.   IPA

Tapped out cloud gold.  7°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of tart Granny Smith apples, and raw plain yogurt.

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with moderate carbonation.

Palate has flavors of unfiltered apple juice with sweet, fruity, tart, light astringency. 

Hop flavors are light sappy, and grassy at most.

Finish is clean, fruity, fresh.  There is no tart, no bitter, no lingering flavors except that of fresh apple cider.

Overall, a really smart expression of the juicy IPA with sour thrown in to offset the low attenuation, and the whole sweet fruity expression that is so often found in the hazy IPAs on tap today.  I really liked this one.  Likely one of my favorites of the evening.  Kinda nice way to finish the evening after 3 big Imperial stouts and a “stout wine”.",drjoeng
101,Evil Twin NYC ET Found Home: Edition Scwartzbier,4.5,"Queens, New York","5%ABV.  Schwarzbier.   

Tapped out black.  40°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of smoke and wood, and clean malt. It was interesting to nose this next to the Evil Twin Imperial stouts at this tasting because it just highlighted to me how clean a schwarzbier smells. 

Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation.   Sparkling mineral water.

Palate has flavors of light roastiness with a thin charcoal bitter. There is a clean minerality to the palate. Light wheat toast.   There may be some DMS in the palate that suggests corn. 

Hop flavors are woody, minty, hint of resin. 

Finish is medium with a sappy, maybe even piney bitter. 

Overall, a really really nicely executed expression of this lager with clean roast character layered over an expertly executed lager. Good, and I liked this one quite a bit.",drjoeng
102,Evil Twin Perfect Nose Cognac,4.5,"Queens, New York","10%ABV.  American Barleywine   

Tapped out dark brown.  32°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of grape must, overripe grapes, cooking sake, ripe chiku or what is more widely known as sapodilla.  There are some pleasant strong alcohol references to pear and apple brandy.

Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. 

Palate has flavors of caramel, honeyed dates, molasses, fresh barley loaves, especially the moist hearts, hint of black bread, rye bread, and pumpernickel.

Hop flavors are woody, sappy, with a light pine resin.  The hop expression is a little more obvious on the palate.

Finish is medium-long with a resinous, pine sappy bitter floating on a cloud of alcoholic warmth.

Overall, a big bold expression of an American Barleywine style ale.  Good.  I’m still not sure I’d age this one, just because I quite like it as it is, a satisfying fresh strong ale.  The rough edges work, and I’m not sure I want this any smoother.",drjoeng

108,"Other Half Droppin' Millibars - Cacao Nibs, Coffee, Peanut Butter and Vanilla",4.5,"Brooklyn, New York","13.2%ABV.   Imperial stout. 

Tapped out black.  40°SRM. 

Nose has aromas of earth, wood, fire.  There are elements of raw flour, wheat dust, dry hay as well which for me is totally attractive for a stout, which is so rare these days. It’s probably the PB2 that’s giving it the depth of earthy aroma. This is the aroma that suggest wet rotting logs, a compost heap, and fresh turned earth.  The nose has a bit of umami funk that suggest raw soy sauce. 

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with watered honey.  Low-moderate carbonation.  There is a bit of a carbonic tingle on the palate. 

Palate has flavors peanut butter and jelly.  There are herbal flavors suggesting licorice and lineament. There is nice base flavor peanut like a nice peanut butter sandwich or a Thai satay peanut sauce.  There are ample roasty flavors that suggest black coffee, espresso, charcoal and burnt ends.

Hop flavors are woody with a hint of pine resin.

Finish is surprisingly brief and clean with a hint of umami that suggests dashi, bonito flakes or soy. 

Overall, a big complex imperial stout that’s not like any other peanut butter concoction. This iteration seems to have gone umami, funky, and earthy instead of creamy, sweet, and boring.",drjoeng

136,Concrete Jungle Ume,5.0,"Los Angeles, California","Obtained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $4.99, Ume Saladitos is a sour plum gose crafted by Concrete Jungle Brewing Project from Ventura, California.

The fragrance of Lactobacillus yeast and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy gold and pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5%.

Plums flavors the body, sours the comprehension, and felt upon the mouthfeel. Lactobacillus delbrueckii adds a soft lactic touch and tarts the take. Mexican candy is noticeable with the Lactobacillus. Saison brightens the dry finish. Munich malt compliments the plum profile. Flaked oats are sensible upon the yeasty and plum mouthfeel. Himalayan sea salt adds a touch to the saison and Lactobacillus blend.

Ume Saladitos is a glamorous sour plum gose. The plums, Lactobacillus, Mexican candy, saison, Munich malt, and Himalayan sea salt combine into a delectable craft beer. Inspired by Umeboshi soda and Saladitos, the Lactobacillus delbrueckii and sea salt blend into a soda like tinge. The Lactobacillus delbrueckii gives off a yogurt like tone to the plum and saison body. The sour plum and lactic tart are fair and easy to experience. I prized every drink and dazzled by its complexity. The artwork is by Andrea Mendoza.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

158,Mother Earth Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout,5.0,"Vista, California","Attained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $10.25, Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout brewed with liquid cocoa and cocoa nibs is crafted by Mother Earth Brew Company from Vista, California.

The scent of cocoa, roasted malt, lactose, and mint are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 10.8%.

Liquid cocoa is rich, creamy, prominent in tone, and tasted when you lick your chops. Roasted malt lightly textures the mouthfeel. Cocoa nibs is tangible and compliments the roasted malt feel. Milk assists with the creamy liquid cocoa hue. Mint is strong from beginning to end and imbued with the liquid cocoa and milk complexion. Rye malt is distinguished as the finish drags on. A caramel, barleywine touch is discerned upon the mouthfeel in the finish. Oak applies a woodsy tinge to the liquid cocoa, milk, and caramel finish.

Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout is a luminous stout. The liquid cocoa, roasted malt, cocoa nibs, milk, mint, rye malt, and barleywine combine into an impressive interpretation of a mint chocolate stout. The barleywine, rye malt, and cocoa nibs provide a hair-raising finish. The liquid cocoa and milk blend delightfully together. The barleywine barrel aging is the highlight of this beer. I cherished every single drink and found an impressive beer beyond a variant of a style.

173,Boulevard / Ommegang Collaboration No. 4 Saison,5.0,"Kansas City, Missouri","#OldHopsforOldPops special

Gifted for Christmas from Jenna and James Sepulveda (purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $14.99), Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a malt beverage brewed with spices crafted between Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri and Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York.

The smell of saison, rye, honey, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber with a half a finger of white head. When held up to light, a cloudy golden amber shows. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Saison is fairly sweet and wholesome to the complexion. Caramel malt textures the mouthfeel and light to the body. Honey blends well with the saison and caramel. Coriander compliments the caramel and honey frame. Orange peel is tangible with the saison feel. Lemon peel is subtle to the honeyed touch. Safir hops applies a tangerine hue to the saison and orange peel combination.

Rye fairly spices the take and the caramel comprehension. Grains of paradise softly peppers the malt body. Oats adds texture to the mouthfeel and easily picked out in the finish. Pear is drawn out in the finish followed by the honey. Perle hops express mint and evergreen notes that are vibrant to the pear finish. Clove provides an underlying tone to the minty profile.

Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a sensational malt beverage. The saison, caramel malt, honey, rye, orange peel, lemon peel, and Safir hops makes this beer a one of a kind. The caramel, honey, and rye blend beautifully together. The pear, honey, and oats work in concert well in the effervescent finish. My favorite aspect is how the spicy hops, rye, and grains of paradise interplay collectively. After being bottled in the summer of 2014 and aged for 5 years, the Perle hops give off a strong minty hue in the finish. I treasure every single drink and enamored by this brew’s complexity and depth. It is beer like this that challenges the notion how long should you age your beer.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The aroma of pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Pineapple is juicy and felt upon the mouthfeel in the dry finish. Grapefruit blends with the pineapple and fairly bitters the take. Oranges are discerned as the finish prolongs. Mango fills the body and smoothens the drink. Cantaloupe is noticeable with the watery aspect. 

Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is an appetizing American pale ale. The pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and cantaloupe come together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple and grapefruit dazzles the take. The light orange note compliments the cantaloupe. The double dry hop is barely noticeable until the dry finish.

223,Unibroue Trois Pistoles,5.0,"Chambly, Quebec","Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.

The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.

Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.

Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Again, there's caramel, toffee, and Christmas cake, but also butterscotch, as well as dates, prunes and raisins. There are some firm piney slightly spicy hops at the back, which finish of proceedings beautifully. The mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, the carbonation moderate. Goddamn this is a magnificent, complex, rich and sumptuous treat. Seems more like a hoppy barley wine than IIPA, but who cares when it's this good?

248,Brouwerij West Hitchhiking Ghosts,5.0,"San Pedro, California","Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $5.99), Hitchhiking Ghosts is a hazy IPA crafted by Brouwerij West from San Pedro, California.

The scent of pineapple and floral hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pineapple is juicy and offers a fair tart to the take. Motueka hops compliments the pineapple with a lime touch. Citra hops give off a mango hue to the pine complexion. Mosaic hops imbues a bubblegum flavor to the body. Raw oats are distinguished upon the mouthfeel in the finish. 

Hitchhiking Ghosts is an ethereal IPA. The pineapple and Motueka hops combination is the vehicle that takes us on for the ride. The bubblegum aspect is the figurative hitchhiker while setting the beer apart. The mango and bubblegum notes harmonize well with the raw oats. I loved drinking this craft brew and impressed by its creative, interpretive concept.

Effervescent in the mouth, big hops (pine nuts, resin) on the start, but with a rounded, juicy, citrus finish.  Great balance of bitter at the start and very slightly sweet at the end. Hides its 9% very well because of its inherent drinkability.  It’s an excellent version of the NE style from a promising new Utah brewery.

269,Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5.0,"Reno, Nevada","As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

The aroma is very malty with no hop aroma which is proper for this style.  The flavor is also full malt, but balanced by a decent amount of hop bitterness.

312,Gulpener / Oedipus Flitspopper,4.9,"Gulpen, Netherlands","Eisbock de 7,5 % abv, qui est en fait un blend entre le vrai eisbock
de la maison Gulpener et une sour ale de chez Oedipus …
Deux remarques de principe à propos du style de la bière :
1 une bière de 7,5 % abv peut difficilement être un eisbock .. (Trop faible)
2 cette bière étant un blend avec une bière usuelle, ne peut en aucun cas
relever de la méthode de glaçage en intégral que requiert l'eisbock.
En clair, cette bière, pour ces deux raisons, ne peut être un vrai eisbock.
Juste un ersatz …
Au programme malts d'orge, de blé et d'avoine. Très bien.
Houblonnage … et dry hopping (étrange pour le genre, s'il en est ..)
Mon exemplaire, en format 30 cl,  était à 6 mois avant sa date.
(ce qui est ridicule pour un véritable eisbock … preuve supplémentaire !!)
Couleur roux clair, aux reflets orangés, et clarté nette.
Bulles très rares.
Mousse beige, en nappage fin à 1 mm.
Arômes de mangue, ananas, clémentine corse … 
(Un nez sympathique, mais, faut-il le signaler pour les néophytes,
qui n'a rien à voir - ou plutôt à sentir - avec un eisbock ...)
1ère bouche souple, avec un fruité à la mandarine, clémentine, 
et une légère pointe de zeste … très bien intégrée.
Arrière-bouche avec un côté pulpeux agréable, digne d'une neipa ..
2ème bouche avec des saveurs toujours agrumiques, très fines.
Arrière-bouche avec une légère nuance de torréfié, loin, très loin ...
Longueur aux belles nuances de neipa, avec une pointe d'acidité jolie.
Jambes fines, serrées, longues.
Levure fine, précise, belle ligne.
Alcool très bien, en fait, vu la mutation des styles .. il s'est adapté
avec un  double flip arrière pour travailler une neipa ..
Finale très délicate, avec une belle harmonie.
CONCLUSION : Gulpener, en voulant inventer le "" sour eisbock "" ..
a en fait inventé par le plus grand des hasards le "" neipa bock "" …
grâce à l'apport de Oedipus .. et son sour machin (en fait non sour).
Les flitspopper en savent grâce aux brasseurs, métamorphosés
en flitspopper lunaire une nuit de pleine lune … ce qui n'est pas 
vraiment une mince affaire .. mais tout à fait à leur portée.
Comme ils le disent très bien … "" verrukkelekkukkelijk "" ..
ce qui est intraduisible, sauf pour les martiens flitspoppiens …
Je voterai pour cette bière lors d'une élection flitspoppale ... 
N.B. Ma cote se réfère à une neipa bien entendu, et non un eisbock ..",corkyrory66

A dank and juicy IPA using Golden Promise, wheat and Cara Munich malts in the mash for a sweetly smooth body. For the hops we judiciously bittered with Magnum in the kettle followed by Citra T90 in both the whirlpool and in dry-hopping. The aroma/flavour is fruit-filled, dank and resinous, with plenty of tropical mango giving a moreish drinkability. Fermented with our house American ale yeast (WLP001) for a refreshingly clean finish, this IPA is also our first gluten-free beer using Brewers Clarex®.

332,Hoof Hearted Belloq American Stout,4.9,"Marengo, Ohio","Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Bulloq is an American stout with coffee and vanilla added brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.

The aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a minimal khaki head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Chocolate is light and smooth the drink. Vanilla creams and tones the chocolate complexion. Espresso bitters the take and flavors the body. Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and espresso combination. Roasted malt textures the mouthfeel and compliments the espresso. Char deepens and enriches the chocolate and roasted malt frame.

Bulloq is a luscious American stout. The chocolate, vanilla, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and char blend together into a ravishing beer. The chocolate, espresso, and char leaves a lasting impression. The caramel and espresso dazzles the chocolate and vanilla body. The roasted malt and char applies a tantalizing touch to the mouthfeel.

348,Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5.0,"Boortmeerbeek, Belgium","Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

362,Booze Brothers 1-800-Tropics,4.7,"Vista, California","Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (purchased from Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $4.99), 1-800-TROPICS is an unfiltered IPA brewed by Booze Brothers Brewing Company from Vista, California.

The scent of pineapple and mango are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.7%.

Pineapple is juicy and has a pleasing tart to the take. Simcoe hops are discerned upon the cusp of the drink. Mango flavors the complexion yet lacks body and weight followed by a hint of lime. Centennial hops compliments the pineapple and assists with the bitter take.

1-800-TROPICS is a delightful unfiltered IPA. The pineapple and Simcoe, Mosaic, and Centennial hops combine into a delicious IPA. Simcoe and Centennial hops dazzles the bitter and pineapple take. Mosaic hops gleams the body and is the star to this brew giving off the mango and lime notes. The hop bitterness is moderate and drinkable. I loved drinking this IPA and reminds me of being on a beach in Maui, Hawaii.

387,Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,"Stockport, Greater Manchester","Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back.

The version I am having has been aged in Burgundy white wine barrels for 4.5 years. Amazing fruity nose similar to to the original and the unique edition versions. This one has a significant influence from the white wine barrels, adding a superb dry, aromatic note on top of the base beer aroma. Hints of fresh leather too. Modestly sweet, but not overly so. Somewhat viscous - I prefer a bit more bulk but it’s definitely not ‘watery’ or anything. Quite drying - lots of the white wine again, freshly baked bread behind it. A hint of sourness, presumably from the yuzu fruit, but this takes a back seat after all the years of ageing. Hops have practically vanished, least any bitterness that they may have had before.

414,Anchorage Anadromous Belgian Black Bier ,5.0,"Anchorage, Alaska","Purchased at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Anadromous is a black sour ale brewed with Summit hops and triple fermented in French oak foeders, Pinot noir, and whiskey barrels crafted by Anchorage Brewing Company from Anchorage, Alaska.

The aroma of chocolate, Pinot noir, whiskey, and fair Brettanomyces yeast funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark purplish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Black currants tarts the take and flavors to the drink. Pinot noir wine fills the complexion and is prominent on the dry, lactic finish. Whiskey adds a boozy undertone to the wine. Chocolate malt infuses with the wine and whiskey body. Toffee is light and compliments the chocolate. Figs are noticeable with the malt and boosts the malt texture. 

Plums are tangible with the toffee and yeasty combination. Brettanomyces yeast brings a leathery funk to the mouthfeel. Saccharomyces yeast brings out the chocolate while Lactobacillus assists with the tart punctuation. Summit hops spices the comprehension and adds onto the tart and lactic take. Oak applies a woodsy touch to the chocolate malt and Pinot noir wine feel.

Anadromous is a voluptuous black sour ale. The chocolate malt, black currants, Summit hops, and Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts sets this sour ale apart from the sour market. The spicy Summit hops, tart black currants, and lactic yeasts dazzles the take. The Saccharomyces yeast slightly sweetens the chocolate and toffee frame. The Pinot Noir wine gleams the complexion and is the focal point of the craft beer. The boozy whiskey makes this sour ale easier to drink. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its colorful bouquet of flavors. For the consummate sour beer fan, the tart and sour comes across as a 2.7 out of 5; and 3.4 out of 5 for a newcomer.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.",dflb

A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az ""imperial"" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival.

Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban.

Az aromák folyékony halmazállapotba kerülve konyakmeggy, vanília, bourbon, csipkebogyólekvár és füstös eperdzsem varázslatos keverékét adják, melyet angolszász stílusban közvetítenek, teret engedve azonban minden elem vibrálásának, így téve lehetővé végtelennek tetsző részletességű komponenseinek érvényesülését, melyek egyenként is művészi értékkel bírnak.

500,Magic Rock Dark Arts,5.0,"Huddersfield, West Yorkshire","Smokey, roasted malts, caramel, charcoal. This drink pours jet black with a thin brown head.

Beautiful stout and at 6% packs a nice punch the body is medium with good carbonation, a perfect all rounder for me. 4 cans of this for £5 in tesco you can't go wrong.

501,Kent Falls Coffeemaker,5.0,"Kent, Connecticut","Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $11.99, Coffeemaker is a Brettanomyces pale ale crafted in collaboration between Kent Falls Brewing Company from Kent, Connecticut and Sacred Grounds in Sherman, Connecticut.

The fragrance of saison, lemon, tangerine, and low funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours two fingers of white head. The alcohol content is 5.6%.

Saison tones the body and smoothens the drink. Tangerines fairly bitters the take and flavors the dry finish. Roasted coffee adds onto the bitter take and leaves texture at the back of the throat. Lemon brings a zest and tinge to the tangerine and saison frame. Brettanomyces yeast provides a dry hay funk to the body and layers a lactic tinge to the saison and citrus take. Wheat is sensible with the citrus zing.

Coffeemaker is a ravishing Brettanomyces pale ale. The saison, tangerine, lemon, roasted coffee, and Brettanomyces yeast deliver a color bouquet to this craft beer. The roasted coffee and citrus bitterness is beautiful. The lemon, saison, and lactic acidity dazzles the take. The tangerine finish is a cherry on top to the libation. I cherished every single drink and enamored by its depth and complexity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

502,The Bruery Bakery: Banana Bread,4.6,"Placentia, California","The Bruery's Banana Bread Imperial Stout starts with an impressive pour consisting of dark brown cloudy body capped with a towering tan head. Lacing is strong throughout and very resilient. Light overripe banana notes peek out behind stronger walnut and roast malt aromas. The flavors are less nutty and more bready with a good amount of chocolate and toffee taking precedence. The beer is sweet and ever so slightly tart at the end of each sip helping to keep balance. Vanilla and oak starts to rise mid glass. Overall, the bourbon is understated. There is no whiskey on the nose, and there is no burn. Banana Bread fills the palate without weighing too heavily on it, and is very creamy with a carbonation that crescendos in the middle of the swallow then tails off. This works exceedingly well to deliver a mild sweet nutty fade. Excellent.",freekyp

Une mousse moka rocailleuse et pétillante recouvre un liquide brun foncé très clair aux reflets rougeâtres. La mousse descend assez rapidement. En bouche, le Bourbon s’installe dès l’entrée de bouche, se mariant ensuite à d’intenses notes de fruits noirs (pruneaux, raisins secs) avec un fond bien soutenu de toffee. L’équilibre alcool et fruité est parfait. On y retrouve également des notes de cerises ainsi que du chocolat. Le corps est pleinement rond et sa texture très veloutée.

Saison is bright and earthy to the complexion. Bouclier hops bitters the take, spices the yeasty comprehension, and adds a lemon hue. Clove adds tone to the yeast and slightly textures the mouthfeel. Brettanomyces yeast yields a musty grape like funk to the body.

Biere du Nord is a resplendent saison. The saison, Bouclier hops, and clove sets this beer apart from its style. The saison and Bouclier hops compliments each other. The carbonation and clove dazzles upon the mouthfeel. The spicy Bouclier hop and clove combination is my favorite aspect of this saison. I loved drinking this beer and impressed by its simple creativity.

Attained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $14.99, Cinnamon Babka is a Babka-style imperial milk stout with cinnamon, cacao, vanilla, and salt crafted in collaboration between Grimm Artisan Ales and Mekelburg’s Fine Foods and Craft Beer from Brooklyn, New York.

The smell of chocolate, cocoa, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black that pours a minimal beige head. When held up to light, no light shines through. The alcohol content is 12%.

Chocolate is fairly rich, thick to the body, and tasted when you lick your chops. Milk creams and silkens the complexion accentuated by a vanilla tone. Cacao assists the chocolate, bitters the take, and textures the mouthfeel. Cinnamon spices the take and colors the chocolate comprehension. Biscuit malt is distinguished with the chocolate, milk, and cinnamon blend followed by a salty touch.

Cinnamon Babka is a luscious Babka-style imperial milk stout. The chocolate, cacao, milk, vanilla, biscuit malt, cinnamon, and salt come together into an extremely smooth and delicious craft beer. The cacao and cinnamon dazzles with the spice and bitter upon the take. The chocolate, biscuit malt, and milk merge into a savory sensation. At 12%, the alcohol content warms the drink and enriches the chocolate and biscuit malt feel. I cherished every single drink and found an indelible craft beer. This brew will motivate you to have a second serving.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

573,Founders Underground Mountain Brown,5.0,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","24-12-2019; bottle; at the Swedish house (bought at Saveur Bière, #24 of Beery Christmas 2019). 
The looks of the beer are perfect. It looks delicious. The beer has a lovely dark ruby red colour, with a nice brown tint. It is dark enough to make it look like it is black. On top of the beer there is some soft tanned foam. Foam retention is low and hardly a drape is left on top of the beer. It kinda looks like coffee, creating a nice link to the Sumatran coffee used in the brewing kettle. 
The aroma of the beer is truly divine. It is so rich and full of aroma and flavour, intense. The nose is filled with everything and all at once. Harmonious. Where to start. First, malts. They are toasted and roasted, giving aromas of coffee, chocolate, some toffee and burnt caramel. Very nice and very rich. Some dried plums and red fruit hints are there in the distance. The coffee and chocolate aromas are enhanced by the added Sumatran coffee. Or the other way around; the coffee aroma is very pure and strong and it is more prominent than the malts. It is the main character in the aroma. The hops give the beer some nice herbal and leafy notes. Not to strong, but that is not needed in this beer style. This already is delicious and harmonious, but then the oak barrels kick in. Oak wood, some vanilla, lovely sweet corn Bourbon, some peat and smoke. It is al there, creating a very smoothing layer of aromas. It is one of the best oak barrel aromas I've had. It goes so well with the roast of the coffee and the malts. Devine. 
The taste of the beer is of the same pristine quality. It is soo smooth and balanced. Sweet malts with some sweet vanilla notes from the oak, roasted bitters from the oak and malts but also nice bitter hop aromas. Then there also are some delicate sours form the cask flora. This, together with the slight savouriness form the roast and toast, results in a perfectly balanced beer. 
The palate is just as genius. It is silk as smooth with a robust strong and full body. It has a creamy lining. Carbonation is low, but the nice hight alcohol warmth gives a good tingle. The finish of the beer is rich, full and aromatic. Filled with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak wood, some of the red fruits. It is incredible. Truly a beer worthy of being nr. 24 in Beery Christmas 2019. The best beer to end Christmas eve with. Cheers and merry Christmas.",Gangstergafje

635,Propolis Prunus (11/13) ,5.0,"Port Townsend, Washington","Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.

The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.

Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.

Under normal circumstances (like a child’s birthday) this would be a good thing, However, it was a weird sensation and eventually a lesson in being careful for what you wish for. On the surface it was a blend of about 5 of the best hops that you would want in any beer, including my favourite the Nelson Sauvin. However its combined taste was almost like a dinner party where everyone wants to talk and no one listen. Summary with so many bold flavours aggressively punching through this beer was just too sweet.",IPAMonger135
641,Vibrant Forest Metamorph,5.0,"Hardley, Hampshire","Metamorphism is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching. For this lovely Amarillo hopped  beer from Hampshire, that is exactly what you get. A transition. The excellent addition of oats make for a beautiful transformative taste across the entire tongue. Quite literally from the West Coast to the East in hops performance. Or was that the other way round? Who cares, I was so waisted. There is a delicacy of taste that clips the cusp of your tongue here and it makes this worth a re visit many times over. What a great APA",IPAMonger135

Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that settles into a thick ring that curves into a film that nearly covers the liquid, with a hole on just one side. Notes of lemon, white grapes, acidity, oak, vanilla, bright funk, and herbs. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, bright, acidic mouthfeel in great balance. Really does capture both house styles well. Great collaboration.",phaleslu

646,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout,4.9,"Chicago, Illinois",Goose Island Beer Company’s Bourbon County Brand Stout 15.2% ABV 60 IBU. This imperial stout pours a opaque brownish black color with a khaki mocha colored head that dissipates rather quickly leaving some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of bourbon roasted grains vanilla and anise with hints of burnt sugar molasses toffee and oak. The flavor is of dark chocolate bourbon vanilla and oak with hints of burnt sugar dark fruits like raisins prunes figs dates dried cherries with nutty tones along with hints of char molasses tobacco coffee anise brown sugar coffee with a slight hop bitterness on the finish offsetting the sweetness nicely. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a syrupy consistency with not much carbonation and with a slight burn from the high abv.

667,Paradox Beer Skully Barrel No. 60 (B'aril Blood),5.0,"Divide, Colorado","Bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $16.99, B’aril Blood 2018 is a wild sour ale brewed with pomegranate juice and tangerine peels aged in oak barrels brewed by Paradox Beer Company from Divide, Colorado.

The fragrance of pomegranates, funk, and lactic yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber that pours a fast dissipating white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow hue shows. The alcohol content is 8.2%.

Saccharomyces yeast is sensible upon the cusp of the drink. Pediococcus yeast has an accentuated lactic tinge and butters the yeasty body. Lactobacillus yeast tarts the comprehension. Pomegranate juices the complexion and is prominent in the finish. Tangerine peels flavors the pomegranate character and easily distinguished with the water quality of the finish. Brettanomyces yeast adds a moderate funk to the body that grows as the beer warms. Lemon smoothens the drink and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic mouthfeel.

B’aril Blood is a mesmerizing wild sour ale. The colorful array of Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts to the pomegranate, tangerine, and lemon complexion is extraordinary to experience. The Saccharomyces and pomegranate fairly sweetens the beer. Pediococcus yeast is the highlight while making this sour beer easier to drink. The sour and tart are pleasantly strong for a sour beer fan; 4.2 out of 5 for a newcomer. I cherished every single drink and found an immersive brew in its complexity and depth.

Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.",FrothyStave49

678,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","En bouche, cette bière est assez douce. Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.

A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.",YeastLees62

680,Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","Ce qui frappe d’entrée de jeu avec cette jolie blonde est son amertume. Elle est très présente, ce qui lui confère beaucoup de caractère. Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.

En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans. Et, ce petit goût floral vaut le détour.

La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble.

688,Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,"Giey-sur-Aujon, France","A première vue, on sent ces levures. Elle se révèle assez maltée d’une part mais rafraîchissante, bien liquide de l’autre. En cette canicule ce n’est pas désagréable !
Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.

Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer.

Distinct notes of rhubarb and sour berries are the main stars of this beer, which provide the sourness as well as a hint of sweetness. There is also a saltiness in this beer which, surprisingly, pairs with the sour fruit notes quite harmoniously.

Perfect mouthfeel with near foamy carbonation. Delicious stuff.",poisoneddwarf
702,Out of Bounds Powdered Toast Man,5.0,"Rocklin, California","Obtained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $7.99, Powdered Toast Man is a French toast inspired brown ale crafted by Out of Bounds Brewing Company from Rocklin, California.

The scent of maple syrup, doughy malt, and vanilla are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark reddish brown with a low vanilla head. When held up to light, light reveals a clear ruby red body. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Maple syrup is rich, sweet, and syrupy to the mouthfeel. Doughy malt tones and fills the maple syrup body. Vanilla colors and brightens the doughy comprehension. Cinnamon fairly spices the take and tangible with the maple syrup.

Powdered Toast Man is a delightful brown ale. The maple syrup, dough malt, vanilla, and cinnamon combine into a craft beer impersonation of French toast. The moment I tasted this beer, it reminded me of eating French toast as a kid. The maple syrup and doughy malt frame feels as if eating French toast melted in your mouth. This brew does not hint at all that you are drinking a beer; it tastes like breakfast in a glass. I thoroughly enjoyed this brown ale and it would be a go-to beer if I have the chance to visit the brewery on a regular basis.

Au nez le Bourbon est très présent avec des notes vanillées bien comme il faut. Derrière tout ça on retrouve un peu de chocolat, de caramel et de café. En bouche c'est épais à souhait. Là encore le Bourbon et la vanille dominent alors que le trio chocolat/caramel/café se partagent les restes. Pour autant elle n'est pas alcooleuse pour un sou.

En vista propone una corona de espuma amplia matizada de un tono canela y compuesta de perlas pequeñas a medianas, poca retención, el color del líquido ronda la escala más alta del SRM, sin transparencias un obscuro profundo. 

En aroma presenta notas a chocolate, pan quemado, café amargo, carácter a jerez, vainilla, un poco de frutos como ciruela pasa, ligeramente resinosa, la potencia es considerablemente fuerte, muy marcado el carácter de la malta. 

Ya en paladar es espesa, tiene un cuerpo pleno, sabores a frutos secos como pasas, café amargo, chocolate del mismo carácter, un poco de dulzor símil al caramelo, un poco terrosa, jerez, también vainilla, amargor pronunciado y casi al final toque resinoso, el alcohol genera algo de calidez en garganta y esófago pero es tolerable y aceptable en el estilo, final seco, regusto de larga duración, sin duda sigue siendo un buen exponente, me encantó y es justo como a mi me gustan las Imperial Stout.",Yased

Taste is much smoother than the nose, tons of vanilla at the forefront and finish sandwiching bourbon that isn't liquor hot, mild spice and bitter from the chocolate, smooth milky caramel.

773,Nightmare Colombian Necktie,4.6,"Farmingdale, New York","Acquired at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $7.99, Colombian Necktie is a gose ale soured on mangoes with lulo, soursop, and Colombian lime zest brewed by Nightmare Brewing Company from Farmingdale, New York.

The air reveals soursop, lulo, and lime upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 7.2%.

Mangoes sweetens and fills the body, and gives the beer some weight. Lulo pines the complexion. A lactic tart softly sparkles the mouthfeel. Soursop provides a creaminess to the drink, sours the take, and adds a strawberry flavor to the comprehension. Lime brightens the mango and soursop composition. 

Colombian Necktie is a dazzling gose. The mango, lulo, soursop, and lime blend together into a delectable craft beer. The sweet mango and creamy soursop combination is the highlight of this brew. The lulo and lime compliments the mango and strawberry aspect of the soursop. The lime and lactic notes lightly accents the mango and soursop body. I loved drinking this beer and found it to be incredibly delicious.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Some lovely nuance and developing complexity on these flavours, even into the aftertaste. Thick but silky-smooth mouthfeel, roughness coming from the bitterness not the texture. A very nice sweet biscuit malt, hints of chocolate-chip cookie, but rarely gets a chance to shine through all the hops. Its contributions are splendid, however.

802,Boulevard Smokestack Series: Grainstorm Black Rye IPA,5.0,"Kansas City, Missouri","#OldHopsforOldPops special

Bought at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $10.99, 2014 Grainstorm is a black rye IPA crafted by Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri.

The scent of rye, cocoa, pine, and citrus are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, brown shows at the surface. The alcohol content is 7.7%.

Roasted malt enriches the complexion and brings out the grains that follow. Barley is prominent and compliments the roasted malt. Rye is flush to the malt body and spices the comprehension. Cocoa deepens and broadens the barley and roasted malt profile. Mocha coffee accents the body and bitters the take. Caramel smoothens and underlines the drink.

Piney hops brightens and emphasizes the rye tone. Wheat is sensible as the pine imbues the mouthfeel. Grapefruit is distinguished upon the barley character. Tangerine is noticed as the bitter finish prolongs. An orange zest provides a tinge to the cusp of the drink.

Grainstorm is an extraordinary black rye IPA. The roasted malt, barley, rye, cocoa, mocha, and caramel blends amazingly in the body and livened by the grapefruit, tangerine, and orange zest. The barley, rye, and pine ravishes the take. Cocoa, mocha, roasted malt, and caramel harmonize well together and add depth to the beer. After contacting the brewery to establish when the beer I bought is bottled, the bottle date is February 2014. After being aged for five years, the hop experience is gentle and easy to drink; but still notable with the coffee bitterness. I treasured each drink and mesmerized by its complexity and depth. I have two more bottles that have been aged longer than this that is making me curious how it is going to come across.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

844,Delirium Nocturnum,5.0,"Melle, Belgium","Obtained at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $13.99, Delirium Nocturnum is a Belgian dark ale brewed by Brouwerij Huyghe from Melle, Belgium.

The smell of chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark brown with a finger of beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a reddish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Caramel flavors the body and smoothens the complexion. Chocolate compliments the caramel tone. Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel. Mocha accents and colors the take. Licorice spices the take and brings a lingering bitterness in the finish. 

Roasted barley infuses with the caramel and mocha notes. Plums rounds out the feel. Raisins slightly sweetens the beer and distinguished upon the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the body followed by a coriander touch. Honey sweetens the caramel and yeasty complexion and noticeably sticky when you lick your chops.

Delirium Nocturnum is a splendid Belgian dark ale. The caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, mocha, plums, and roasted barley makes this Belgian ale pop out from the Belgian market. The caramel base and tone reminds you of a Trappist ale. The brown sugar, mocha, and roast barley excites the caramel and chocolate comprehension. The honey becomes brighter as the finish prolongs. I cherished every single drink while the complexity and depth captivates our taste buds.

875,Modern Times Neverwhere,5.0,"San Diego, California","Attained at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $13.99, Neverwhere is a tropical Brett IPA crafted by Modern Times Beer from San Diego, California.

The aroma of pineapple and funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a slightly hazy golden amber that pours a two finger white head. The alcohol content is 7.4%.

Pineapple pierces the body and gleams the mouthfeel. Mango juices and smoothens the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast provides a fluorescent funky tone. Citra hops adds a lime hue to the pineapple body. Pale malt is tangible to the mango and yeast composition. Chinook hops spices the take and adds to the pine character. Centennial hops are sensible with the pineapple feel.

Neverwhere is an otherworldly Brett IPA. The Citra, Centennial, and Chinook hops combine with the pineapple, mango, and Brettanomyces yeast into a mystical craft beer. The pineapple and mango sparkle upon the comprehension. The Centennial hops and pineapple blend together as the murky funk sets in. The pale malt and Centennial hops infuses with the pineapple profile accentuating the drink. I treasured drinking this beer and amazed by its complexity. This brew is part of a rotation; so, thankfully, it is not a one-and-done.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The looks of the beer are nice. It is a typical IPA look. This is what an IPA should look like. The colour is a pale straw yellow. It is a super cloudy beer. Like, super cloudy. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of soft white foam. Foam retention is low-average. A nice drape is left on the beer. Noice.
The aroma of the beer is ver nice. It is quite aromatic. Most gluten-free beers I've had tend to be a bit mild in aroma. But not this one. The malts are nice and smooth, with some nice bready notes. There is a hint of caramel. The hops are intense. It has some lovely fruity citrus hop notes. Citrus zest, stone fruit like peach and some passionfruit. It is a juicy fruity bouquet. Very nice. 
The taste of the beer is also very nice. It is quite a sweet IPA. There are sweet malt notes and also some sweet fruit notes. The hops are nice and bitter, together with a nice sour fruitiness. It is well balanced. It isn't too sweet. The sweetness contributes to the juicy fruit juice aspect.
The palate of the beer is also quite nice. Medium body, smooth texture and also nice and creamy. Carbonation is medium. The finish of the beer is very nice. It has loads and loads of tropical fruits and juicy notes. It is amazing. The finish lingers on for a long time, inviting you to drink more and more. So many fruits. I love it.",Gangstergafje

894,Green Flash Imperial IPA,5.0,"San Diego, California","Purchased at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $6.99, Imperial IPA is a western style IIPA brewed by Green Flash Brewing Company from San Diego, California.

The air reveals pine and herbal hops as you drink. The appearance is an orange amber with a low white head. Light reveals a hazy body. The alcohol content is 9%.

A bitter hop take greets you along with an earthy pine resonance. Grapefruit flavors the body followed by a mango hue. Evergreen lightly colors the hop profile and an anise like spice gleams the drink. A woodsy touch accompanies the pine, mango, and malt comprehension.

Green Flash Brewing Company’s Imperial IPA is delectable. The bouquet of Summit and Nuggets give off the flavors you experience. The pine, grapefruit, mango, anise, and woodsy feel blend together into a beautiful, bitter IPA. The anise like spice accentuates the hop bitterness. The hop bitterness is not as powerful as a Stone IPA, but strong to please a fan of the western IPA style. At room temperature, the evergreen and woodsy tone highlights the complexion. I loved drinking this brew and delighted by its vibrant hop profile.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

925,Golden Road Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse,5.0,"Los Angeles, California","Acquired at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a wheat ale infused with raspberries crafted by Golden Road Brewing from Los Angeles, California.

The scent of raspberries, lemon, and tequila are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a reddish purple with a low white head. When held up to light, a ruby red hue glows. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Raspberries fairly sweetens the complexion and lightly tarts the take. Lemon sours the comprehension while citrusy to the touch. Tequila smoothens and tones the drink. Wheat textures the mouthfeel and brings out the raspberries. Oak is sensible upon the tequila and raspberry blend.

Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a thrilling Berliner Weisse. The raspberries, lemon, tequila, and oak come together into a delicious craft beer. Raspberries and lemon provide a splendid interplay of sour and tart notes. Reposado tequila is discerned which compliments the raspberry and oak notes. The sour and tart are drinkable and easy to experience. I cherished every single drink and enthused by its depth. I would put this down as a bucket list beer.

Palate: medium-full body, low carbonation, bittersweet finish, low dryness, medium alcohol sensation
Overall: The maltiness is very strong and complex. Hoppiness is complementary and attenuated due to the aging. The flavor profile is somewhat similar to Golden Pride which balances toward malty sweetness, but this one has more depth. Perfect.",WortMeister11

955,Rogue Farms Marionberry Braggot,5.0,"Newport, Oregon","Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.

The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.

Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.

Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

969,Mount St. Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,4.5,"Coalville, Leicestershire","330ml glass bottle priced at £3.75 from Drink of Fulham.  Dated as best before 12/03/2021. Served having been out of refrigeration for around 30 minutes into a goblet. 

A beer I’m building up a lot and very excited about trying. Love the monks.

The beer pours a deep deep dark mahogany colour with plenty of sediment visible in the glass. Also, despite the dark colour carbonation is visible. The head peaks at around two fingers, varying sizes of bubbles but lots of big ones giving the head a rocky slightly loose consistency. Once dissipated down to a thick wedge worth the body of the head settles to become more consistent with a more uniform rigid appearance. The colour is that of caramel, before it becomes sauce.

The aroma seems deceptive once you have tasted the beer. Traditionally Belgian with yeast, sugar, malts. Fairly simple. On the sweeter side of the spectrum.

The taste is beautiful. Dark dried fruits, figs, rasins, yeast, high quality dark chocolate, very light liquorice. Burnt dark brown sugar, lactose. Complex but easy drinking. Up there with the best of the Belgian and Dutch Trappists. 

The mouthfeel is unremarkable. I’m writing this review the day after and can’t recall a particular aftertaste just that there was a hint of creamy lactose in coating the palate. 

Overall, an outstanding beer. Good enough the rival the Trappist big boys in my opinion while maintaining a truly English quality.",PubTun33

979,Mammoth 2015 Bluesapalooza 20th Anniversary Brett Ale,5.0,"Mammoth Lakes, California","Obtained at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, (2015) 20th Anniversary Brett Ale is a wild ale fermented with three strains of Brettanomyces yeast crafted by Mammoth Brewing Company from Mammoth Lakes, California.

The aroma of apricots, lemons, elderflower, and a fair Brettanomyces funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a slightly hazy gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6%.

Apricots flavor the body and juicy to the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast delivers a dazzling lactic touch after the take and adds a yeasty, funky comprehension. Lemon sours the take and tones the drink. Elderflower colors the yeasty and lemon notes. French oak is noticeable upon the funky, dry finish and tangible to the yeasty profile.

20th Anniversary Brett Ale is a resplendent wild ale. The apricots, three Brettanomyces yeasts, French oak, and elderflowers make this craft beer stand out from the sour beer market. After being bottled since 2015, the lactic tinge is sharp and punctuated after the cusp of the drink. Lemons compliments the lactic with sour and tart notes. The French oak becomes prominent over time and the highlight to the complexion. I treasured every single drink and impressed by its complexity. I ended up having a salmon dinner with this brew and paired beautifully with it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1000,Toppling Goliath Mornin' Latte Imperial Coffee Milk Stout,4.5,"Decorah, Iowa","Tall, thick, creamy-looking khaki head above a deeply black body. The head grows dramatically once the pour stops. The body is so deeply black you barely get any of the typical ruby edges with a backlight. The head has good retention, and leaves disconnected lacing. Gorgeous look in the Imperial tulip pint glass.

Strong coffee aroma, roasted coffee and malts, chocolate behind.

Wow! The mouthfeel is smooth, thick, creamy, but not quite chewy. A little carbonation contribution, but not much.

Taste is coffee-forward, rich, decadent, with chocolate and lactose. There is a slight bitterness in the finish that lingers in the aftertaste for a short while, but dissipates leaving a thick coffee and chocolate, smoothed with lactose, flavors to savor (although the bitterness does become a bit more pronounced in the aftertaste as the beer warms). No hint of the 8.9% ABV.

Overall, it has a very rich feel and flavor, slightly sweet but never cloying. An excellent sipping beer, decadent enough for an after dinner desert, but not as sweet as describing it as such might imply.  I love this beer.",MNAle

Low bitterness with a soft and creamy mouthfeel that really accentuates the hoppy juiciness.  Finding new Toppling Goliath beers makes coming to Iowa (somewhat) worth it.

1007,Stone Buenaveza,4.7,"Escondido, California","Attained at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $4.99, Buenaveza is a salt and lime lager brewed by Stone Brewing from Escondido, California.

The air yields lime as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow that pours a low white head. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

Lime is fair and vibrant to the drink. Salt is light and felt upon the mouthfeel. Pilsner malt brightens the complexion followed by a Vienna malt finish. As the beer warms, corn is distinguished with the malt composition.

Buenaveza is a sumptuous Mexican lager. This craft beer comes across as a plain Mexican beer, but this is an upgrade over a Modelo Especial or Tecate. It reminds me of making salsa, which I drink as I sample each batch I make. I enjoyed this brew and would gladly buy 24 packs of it.

",4.7,"Purcellville, Virginia","750 ml bottle from Tavour, 11/24/19.  Pours a thick, dark brown-black color with a nice sheeting froth of dark brown head atop it.  Leaves plenty of brown lacing on the glass as you sip this deliciously sweet beverage.  Aroma of rich chocolate and cinnamon.  Some light roast as well.  Drinks sweet, like a beautiful cinnamon hot chocolate with some marshmallows floating in it.  Just enough roast to keep it from being a full on sugar bomb, but still this is damn sweet.  The mouthfeel is silk.  Just completely smooth, creamy, and a little rich.  Finishes slightly sticky, which totally works here.  It should honestly be illegal to hide 13.5% this well.  How often is a 13.5% beer burn free and easy drinking?  Good lord, this is dessert beer at it's best.  Skip the hot chocolate, and instead pour this into a snifter, pull up by the fireplace, and enjoy!  This is the best things I've had in the sweet stout game in quite some time.  Doesn't happen to me often these days, but I am just blown away.

1055,Coachella Valley / Rock's Brewing Coriolis Effect,5.0,"Thousand Palms, California","Purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, Coriolis Effect is an Imperial Wet Hop India Pale Ale crafted in collaboration between Rocks Brewing Company from Alexandria NSW, Australia and Coachella Valley Brewing Company from Thousand Palms, California.

The fragrance of citrusy, tropical, piney, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a clear reddish amber with a low white head. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

The wet hop Amarillo hops provide a watery grapefruit sensation to the complexion. Caramel malt textures and flavors the body. Cantaloupe is pungent to the caramel and grapefruit frame. Lemongrass gleams the grapefruit and pine notes. Mandarin oranges compliments the plum and grapefruit blend. A combination of plum and cherry adds a dimension to the comprehension. An earthy, sweet accent colors the caramel feel. Dill flavors the lemongrass and grapefruit characters. 

Coriolis Effect is a beautiful Imperial IPA. The symphony of flavors from the Australian and New Zealand hops, Rakau, Wakau, and Motueka, along with Sorachi Ace hops and Amarillo wet hops are voluptuous to the drink and provide a moderate bitter take. The caramel, grapefruit, lemongrass, and mandarin orange harmonize handsomely together. The plum, cherry, and mandarin orange excites the drink. The lemongrass, dill, and pine dazzles the citrus base. I treasured every drink as the hoppy composition delivers a complex and flavorful libation. The wet hop helps set this IPA apart from such a popular style.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Une véritable petite gourmandise qui se déguste lentement. Noir total en verre, sans mousse et avec une faible effervescence, nous sommes dans les codes du genre. Le nez présente d'agréables arômes avec une dominante chocolat/noisette agrémentée par du café et du caramel. L'attaque présente un équilibre sans faille, une belle amertume donnant ce qu'il faut de fraîcheur, un alcool à 9,1 % pour mon exemplaire structurant bien la bière, soutenant les arômes et donnant du caractère et un malt intense et dense. Du côté des arômes, le café prend l'ascendant avec du caramel, de la noisette, une pointe pimentée et un chocolat qui se fait plus discret. Excellente corpulence avec en seconde bouche des arômes qui enrobent parfaitement le palais. L’arrière-bouche, davantage sur le chocolat et sur une amertume racée et herbacée, tranche et donne un excellent contraste. Le final, long, nous laisse sur un beau café expresso, racé.

1067,Cloudwater A Wave In The Marlborough Sounds,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","Pours a hazy, orange coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and bright, juicy hop aromas of citrus and stone fruit, with notes of orange, grapefruit and peach, as well as just a hint of peppery spice. Taste is a perfect balance of light biscuity malt and vibrant, juicy, slightly acidic and quite dank hops, with citrus, stone and orchard fruit notes of orange, grapefruit, peach and a hint of gooseberry as well, with just a hint of pine and peppery spice coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness and some dank, citrus hops and lighter pine and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Soft, pillowy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

A fantastic New England Pale Ale with some incredibly vibrant hop notes and full body and mouthfeel for the ABV. Very complex, yet with a perfect balance of sweet, juicy, dank and bitter notes. The dank citrus and stone fruit notes are really complemented perfectly by that typical, dry and somewhat acidic, peppery NZ hop character of white grape and gooseberry here.

1075,Almanac Emperor Norton Tripel,5.0,"San Francisco, California","Acquired at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $9.99, Emperor Norton is a Belgian-style Tripel brewed by Almanac Beer Company from San Jose, California.

The scent of Belgian yeast, grapefruit, pine, and hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is an orange amber that pours a finger of white head. When held up to light, the color shifts to a cloudy gold. The alcohol content is 9%.

Apricots are juicy and pungent to the body. Belgian yeast is earthy, spicy, and creamy to the mouthfeel. Hallertau Blanc hops bring a gooseberry like accent to the bitter take. Citra hops flavors the complexion and ventured throughout the drink. Peaches follows and compliments the grapefruit. Lemon slightly sours the take and serves as an undertone.

Biscuit malt blends well with the Belgian yeast. Caramelized malt sweetens and glistens the creamy and malt base. Pine glistens the Hallertau Blanc hops and lemon aspects to the beer. Clove peppers the take and adds tone to the yeasty comprehension. Coriander is soft to the Belgian yeast hue. 

Emperor Norton is a succulent Belgian Tripel. The dry hopped Citra and Hallertau Blanc hops, apricots, Belgian yeast, biscuit and caramelized malts, and lemon blend wonderfully together. The biscuit malt, caramelized malt, and Belgian yeast are tasty and dazzling to the drink. Coriander, clove, lemon, and Hallertau Blanc hops deliver a complex comprehension. The pine, lemon, and peaches brighten the hop profile. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. This is a one of a kind Belgian Tripel at a reasonable price.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1105,Stone (Berlin) / Jägermeister Arrogant Bastard,4.7,"Berlin, Berlin","At my niece’s birthday party, Jimi Sepúlveda shared Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard, a strong ale brewed with herbs, fruits, and spices crafted by Stone Brewing from Berlin, Germany.

The smell of pine, grapefruit, caramel, and evergreen are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a brownish amber that pours a finger of beige head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Star anise provides a long lasting bitter spice to the comprehension. The hoppy bouquet compliments the bitter take. Caramel brings a smoothness to the body. Pine glistens the caramel and citrus composition. Jagermeister tones the mouthfeel and imbued with herbal notes. Evergreen is prominent from beginning to end. Thyme is sensible to the Jagermeister and caramel blend at room temperature. Grapefruit and oranges delivers a citrusy tinge to the drink. Oranges become pungent in the dry and bitter finish. 

Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard is an otherworldly strong ale. The star anise, caramel, pine, Jagermeister, evergreen, thyme, grapefruit, and oranges come together into a unique craft beer. The Jagermeister and evergreen gleams the caramel and spiced body. Grapefruit and oranges are vibrant on the nose as soon as you pop the cork. At room temperature, the  tart orange and Jagermeister interplay amazingly. I treasured each drink and impressed how well the Jagermeister blends with the Arrogant Bastard. As off base as Jagermeister and a beer together can seem, harnessing it with an Arrogant Bastard works. My father and Jimi contributed to this review.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1139,Goose Island Brasserie Noir,4.9,"Chicago, Illinois","Bought at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $19.39, Brasserie Noir is an imperial stout aged in Cabernet barrels for up to 12 months crafted by Goose Island Beer Company.

The aroma of chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of tan head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark brown shows. The alcohol content is 11.8%.

Chocolate is fair and harmonizes with the roasted malt frame. Molasses thickens the body, enriches the chocolate, and tasted when you lick your chops. Mocha bitters the take and textures the mouthfeel. Vanilla is creamy and brings out the plums used. Figs are noticeable as you go into the finish. The Cabernet flavors the mocha finish. Red currant adds a slight tartness to the brown sugar and coffee bitter take. Oak is distinguished upon the molasses and malty composition.

Brasserie Noire is a tantalizing imperial stout. The chocolate, molasses, mocha, vanilla, plums, figs, red currant, and Cabernet combine into an extraordinary craft beer. The molasses and mocha ravishes the take. The vanilla provides a domineering creaminess that makes this libation drinkable. At room temperature, the Cabernet becomes the highlight to the complexion. I treasured each drink and dazzled by its depth from cold to warm. I think the best serving temperature is at room temperature. At 11.8% and a 765mL bottle, I shared this beer with my father who corroborated in this review.

It smells a bit like candy canes. Very similar to other strong ales such as King goblin. Leaves a bit of an aftertaste for a while (in a good way). A bit of a tang on the end of my tongue. 

Well worth getting 4 for £6 at supermarkets of this ale. It's a huge favourite anyway, but the ultimate experience would be on a cold winters afternoon with perhaps a bit of fog and ground frost, taking a bottle into rural country fields and savouring it.

A lemony, citrus body greets you with a sourness on the take followed by a lactic mouthfeel. Cherries sweeten the complexion and adds a tart to the take. As the lemon mellows, chocolate malt provides a discernible texture to the comprehension. Roasted malt accompanies the chocolate. Lactose brings a light, silky tone to the malty base. Espresso accents the chocolate and lactose while slightly bitters the comprehension. Brettanomyces yeast dries and funks the lemon and cherry finish. French oak delivers a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic bouquet.

Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a ravishing coffee stout. The lemon, cherries, chocolate malt, lactose, espresso, and funky Brettanomyces yeast blend amazingly into a one of a kind beer. The combination of sour, tart, and acidity is easy to experience and beautiful to the malty frame. The lactose eases the drink. The espresso and French oak are dazzling to the malty feel. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity. In the end, this brew is more sour than stout, so be informed before buying this bottle.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Make no mistake, this is a heavy full and sweet beer, the sweetness is unavoidable at these abvs, due to the unfermentable maltodextrin sugars typical of a heavy abv beer.

1207,Dust Bowl Twisted Monk,4.7,"Turlock, California","Attained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.50, Twisted Monk is a Belgian-style abbey ale with cherries crafted by Dust Bowl Brewing Company from Turlock, California.

The scent of caramel, cherries, and Belgian yeast are noted as you drink. The appearance is purplish and clear that pours a minimal white head. When held up to light, a reddish purple glows and reveals tiny particles of sediment. The alcohol content is 7.7%.

Cherries bring a domineering flavor to the body and lightly tarts the take. Caramel is smooth and soft in tone. Belgian yeast creams the cherry and caramel complexion along with an earthy and spice touch to the comprehension. Toffee is drawn out from the Belgian yeast profile. Plums are distinguished from the yeasty and caramel finish. Dates add another sweet touch to the cherries.

Twisted Monk is an enticing Belgian-style abbey ale. The cherries, caramel, toffee, Belgian yeast, plums, and dates come together into an illustrious drink. The cherries and dates do not come across too sweet and gives the complexion a nice touch. The Belgian yeast and toffee combination brings a lovely tone to the malt and cherry frame. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast integrates handsomely with the tart. I loved drinking this beer and mesmerized by its complexity.

Force et caractère caractérisent donc cet Imperial Stout qui se déguste lentement. Elle possède juste un peu trop de sucre à mon goût. En verre, la bière est d'un noir total, quasiment sans effervescence. Le nez est plein, sur le chocolat, le café, le piment, la vanille, le caramel et des accents de noix de coco. L'attaque présente de suite une intensité remarquable. L'amertume, avec 65 d'IBU, permet de conférer une bonne fraîcheur pendant que l'alcool à 13 % donne de la chaleur tout en soutenant convenablement les arômes. Les 13 % ne se ressentent pas réellement, l'alcool étant bien intégré. On retrouve les cocktails présents au nez avec un piment que j'aurais préféré un peu plus atténué. On continue ainsi en deuxième bouche. Le piment donne quant à lui chaud aux papilles en arrière-bouche. Pas de réelles évolutions aromatiques toutefois. La corpulence est par contre assez exceptionnelle. Bel étirement sur le final avec des arômes qui restent longtemps n bouche. Merci à Vincent pour cette découverte.",jybi

1235,Tahoe Mountain Primrose,5.0,"Tahoe City, California","Purchased at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $13.99, Primrose is a hybrid ale aged in oak barrels and blended with Northern California Malbec grapes brewed by Tahoe Mountain Brewing Company.

The smell of Malbec grapes, Brettanomyces funk, and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a purplish red with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.8%.

Malbec grapes have a ravishing, flavorful hue to the body. Brettanomyces yeast follows the fruity grapes with a soft funky touch along with a lactic tart tinge to the mouthfeel. Plums rounds out the body before the beer starts waning into the dry finish. Lemon provides a light citrus feel that compliments the lactic yeast and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the yeast, grape, and lemon frame.

Primrose is an exquisite hybrid ale. The Malbec grapes, funky Brettanomyces yeast, plums, and lemon blend together into a spectacular craft beer. The Malbec grapes and funk harmonize tastefully. Plums brings a fullness to the wine-like Malbec body. The sour and tart are easy to experience and pleasant to the complexion. I absolutely loved drinking this beer. The blend of wine and beer is exemplary. This is an outstanding craft beer; do not pass this up if you manage to find it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1254,Mount St. Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,4.6,"Coalville, Leicestershire","Toute bière Trappiste est toujours un événement. Et d'autant plus lorsque les moines nous offrent un tel breuvage. Une chose est certaine, il y a du belge dans celle-ci. Les moines anglais ont dû prendre quelques conseils auprès de leurs frères belges. Bonne complexité, beaux arômes de fruits et de malts grillés, bonne présence en bouche. Cette trappiste possède de nombreux points forts. Je ne vois qu'un seul bémol pour qu'elle soit splendide, un alcool, à 7,4%, quelque peu limite pour soutenir parfaitement les arômes. Visuellement, c'est une robe brune qui se présente à nous. Une fine couche de mousse nappe la surface. Le nez est sur la prune, la poire, la mélasse, le chocolat, de légères épices et l'alcool donnant un trait de caractère. L'attaque est sur un excellent équilibre avec un alcool faisant un peu plus que son titrage. On y retrouve des arômes fruités (poire, pruneau, banane), alliés à des arômes de chocolat, de caramel et un poivre relevant le tout (ce dernier étant peut-être un brin trop présent). L'alliance est remarquable. La deuxième bouche gagne en intensité tout en devenant un peu plus douce (c'est à ce moment qu'un alcool un peu plus élevé aurait pu être appréciable). L’arrière-bouche est en deux temps, un fraîche amertume en premier laissant place à plus de douceur. Joli final long sur une dominante chocolat, pruneau et caramel. Cette bière est digne des trappistes. J'attends un potentiel grand frère à 10 % avec grande impatience.",jybi

1256,Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan","The beer was purchased in a four pack of 12 oz bottles. Dark brown body had ruby highlights when held up against light. The head was brown, and one finger thick. The beer was lightly carbonated, and the head disappeared shortly after pouring. The aroma was rich, with coffee beans, toffee, and chocolate being the predominant smells. The taste had an incredible depth to it, as the flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and caramel were in perfect harmony. The alcohol content was generously warm. This was definitely a slow sipper, as the sweet aftertaste lingered on and on after swallowing. The body was thick, rich, and coated every corner of the mouth. So glad to have finally found it on the shelves locally. The cost is pretty high at around $24 a four pack, but when you want the best, you have to pay.",rajendra82

1314,Clown Shoes Coffee Pecan Pie Porter,5.0,"Boston, Massachusetts","Obtained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.00, Pecan Pie Porter is an American Imperial Porter crafted by Clown Shoes Beer.

The air yields chocolate, espresso, and lactose upon the nose. The appearance is black that pours a low beige head. When light reflects off of the beer, a dark mahogany hue shows. The alcohol content is 8%.

Chocolate is soft and rich to the complexion. Lactose smoothens the take and creams the comprehension. Caramel fairly thickens the composition and glistens the lactose mouthfeel. Espresso flavors the chocolate and lactose body and slightly bitters the take. Pecan laces and accents the chocolate and espresso frame. Cinnamon is sensible with the espresso and pecan notes. Honey malt sweetens the beer and tangible with the caramel.

Pecan Pie Porter is a delectable American Imperial Porter. The chocolate, lactose, caramel, espresso, and pecan combine into an incredibly delicious beer. The lactose makes the beer incredibly light and tones the chocolate profile. The caramel and honey malt combination comes across syrupy. Pecan is prominent from the start into the malty finish. I loved drinking Pecan Pie Porter and discovered an alluring craft beer. This is really good and offers an immersive complexity to the drink.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Seasonal Wildflower Wit is back! A follow-up to the Elderflower Wit in the springtime, the brewer will continue to release this style each season, combining local & wildcrafted ingredients to subtly enhance a classic style.  Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village of Hoegaarden, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. Inspired by their creation, our brewer freshly foraged sumac to put into the kettle, alongside lemondrop hops, and dried lemon peels.

The flavor is very cinnamon forward along with the chocolate and coffee with accents of chili peppers vanilla cloves and nutmeg there’s a slight toasted earthy almost smoky flavor from the peppers.

This beer was purchased at the brewery on 8/28/19. Jen Kimmich told me it was packaged on 8/26/19. Staying the night in Stowe, the Best Western Hotel stored the 4.5 cases (Don't ask what I spent. I have an understanding wife who does not drink any alcoholic beverage.) in their food refrigerator. Mary, the manager, understood that The Alchemist beers need to be stored cold. Reminds me of what Coors did before going national. Many thanks to Mary and a desk clerk whose name escapes me.

The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a dense white head that remains thick and laces.The nose is tropical fruit with a little grapefruit and with slight piney resin. Body is light medium. Mouthfeel is well rounded with no crisp notes. Taste is tropical fruit, smooth malt structure with a hint of sweetness with light bitterness in the aftertaste. It has a great balance in common with Heady Topper. Using a word from another of their beers, it is Luscious as the little brother to Heady Topper.  Drinking fresh makes a difference. 16 oz can

Tapped out clear gold.  6°SRM.

Palate has flavors of toast, bread crusts, toasted grain.  Overall, the malt backbone is clean grain without much else, soft, and pronounced without being full.

Hop flavors are herbal, minty, hint of wood and forest-y.

Finish is clean with a light herb-like minty bitter.

Overall, a really good style example.  Always pleasant, glad to have put this down in writing finally.  Enjoying a good Bavarian lager is like enjoying roots cuisine, it’s sometimes nice to appreciate what a well-made basic beer tastes like again.",drjoeng

Body is massive, medium carbonation, with a very smooth, slick mouthfeel as its goes down. Taste is a battle between sweet and herbacious/savoury. Lemon, orange, mango, coriander versus pine and liquorice, some coconut cream from the Sabro with a tingling faint bitterness. Reminds me of a Thai green papaya salad, or maybe I'm just hungry?!

The aroma is unreal...soft coffee bean, blueberry muffin, dark chocolate, raisin bread and pancake batter. Damn fine, damn fine. Coffee on the flavor seems restrained compared to stock Speedway, but I’d need a side by side comparison to verify. Great depth with loads of chocolate and roasted malt. Medium to elevated acidity on the finish which does (slightly) negatively impact the palate. Strong bitterness with a lasting cacao musk in the soft palate after each sip.

1479,Cellador Ales Apricot Berlinerish,5.0,"North Hills, California","Attained at Handy Market from Burbank, California for $16.99, Berlinerish is a Berliner Weisse style ale bottle conditioned with honey brewed by Cellador Ales from Los Angeles, California.

The fragrance of apricot, lemon, red wine, and funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 4.6%.

Apricot is juicy and fairly thickens the body. Lemon tones the drink and sours the take. Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts smoothens the complexion and delivers a soft lactic feel. Red wine glistens the dry, funky finish and grows as the finish drags on. 

Orange blossom honey flavors the apricot and lemon frame and tasted when you lick your chops. Oats compliments the yeasty and apricot composition. Floor malted wheat textures the lemon, Pilsner malt, and lactic mouthfeel. Oak offers a woodsy tinge to the wine and yeasty characters.

Berlinerish is a delectable Berliner Weisse. The apricot, lemon, orange blossom honey, Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts, and oats combine into a one of a kind craft beer. The lactic yeasts sparkle with the lemon and apricot body. Spelt is sensible with the malted wheat, Pilsner malt, and oats. The highlight is the orange blossom honey and red wine blending together in the finish. The sour aspect is easy to experience yet sour enough to please a sour fan. I cherished Berlinerish as each drink brings complexity and depth. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

1480,Aecht Schlenkerla Fastenbier,4.9,"Bamberg, Bavaria","Schlenkerla's entire lineup is exceptional, but Lentbier is the pinnacle of old world German craft. A unfiltered malty masterpiece, the aroma swirls between deep breadiness, caramel malts, fireplace smoke and yeast. The smoke is right there at the front of every quaff, but despite its strength, leaves room for the malty character to take center stage. The clean long smoky semi sweet fade ebbs away allowing just a nip of spicy hops to arrive just in time to lend balance. I find myself wanting to take huge gulps, to fill every corner of my mouth with this mahogany magnificence. Scenes of black forest lumberjacks carving through ancient beech trees in a darkening twilight during the high medieval period are entirely appropriate for this session. This beer takes you on a journey. Amazing.",freekyp
