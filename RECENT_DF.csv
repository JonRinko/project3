14,Naked River Squatch Watchin' Wheat,3.0,"Chattanooga, Tennessee","Very malt-forward for an American wheat ale, with an outsized toasted bread and caramel backbone overshadowing the more gentle grassy, fruit-tinged notes of the style. Hints of lemon and orange backed up by mild floral hops offset the malt, but it's hard to find much balance or nuance. Not bad, but not what you'd expect.",oobawa

18,Phase Three Pixel Density,3.4,", Illinois","On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.",tmoreau
19,Blackjack Helles Inspired Lager,2.4,"Manchester, Greater Manchester","Keg @ Jack In the Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy-frothy head.  Has a light Helles styling, but is evident enough with perhaps its crispness its best feature.",ManVsBeer

31,Strangeways Imperial Lucky Leprechaun,3.5,"Richmond, Virginia","16 oz can from Total Wine and More in Short Pump, VA  No brewer name on the label  This was a difficult beer to classify.

36,Lovelady Pomology Saison,4.1,"Henderson , Nevada","On tap at Big Dog's, I assume the pom in the name refers to pomegranate as this had a nice light fruit flavor. Definitely didn't see the 9%.  I liked this quite a bit, but I have a bias towards pomegranate beer.",dwyerpg

49,Blue Spruce Belgian Holiday Spiced Ale,3.2,"Centennial, Colorado","December 14th, 2015 - The smell of Christmas hangs heavy over this hazy, cinnamon colored beer. Vanilla and custard tease rich desserts, while cinnamon and clove give the scent it's holiday cheer.

144,Vintage Snazzy Pants,3.3,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic. As a result it is hard to recommend this unless you really need to rate everything on the menu.",Brigadier
145,Vintage Grain Train,3.8,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy oak, vanilla, and earthy almonds transition to a profile of dry sherry. The soothing warm finish glows on the back of the throat. The hops accent a well balanced experience that might be the best draft at Vintage right now.",Brigadier
146,Vintage Vapour Trail,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A typical New England style IPA, this polished example of the style stands out as a drinkable and accessible version that can help further understand the thought behind it. I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness. From start to finish it provides a hook that shines the stage light on a polished release. Drafts like this show that Vintage is not resting on their laurels.",Brigadier

148,Vintage Crandaddy,3.5,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tart cranberry lined with salty Sour Patch Kid sugar scour the tongue clean. The texture becomes more abrasive over time as it lingers in the throat. Compared to others it might be somewhat pedestrian but it does enough to be a worthwhile experience.",Brigadier

04-02-2020; bottle; at home (bought at de Bodega, Capelle Aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. 
The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.",Gangstergafje

Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.

376,August Schell Stag Series Nordic IPA,4.2,"New Ulm, Minnesota","Fruity aroma: pineapple, citrus - perhaps orange? - tropical fruits.

Color is cloudy burnt orange (brighter with a backlight) and a good level of fine carb bubbles rising to a tall, slightly off-white bubbly-thick head. The head recedes fairly quickly, leaving great-looking strings of lacing around the glass. After just a few minutes, the head is a cap with mounds of thick bubbles.

Taste is different; taking me a bit to characterize it. The pineapple and tropical fruits from the aroma are there, and strongly so, but the taste at the forefront is interesting, very nice and enjoyable, but hard for me to describe (I checked some other reviews - they were no help... maybe it's just me...) 

It is a good tasting beer, despite my lack of words to describe it.  There is some cracker malt presence behind the fruit flavors. A moderate bitterness begins a few seconds after each taste, that grows stronger and lingers into the aftertaste. This is not WC IPA level of bitterness, or even a Midwest IPA level, but more than sufficient to meet expectations for an IPA. The bitterness grows as you drink the beer.

The mouth feel has a solid body with decent carbonation.

The finish is semi-dry.

Overall, a very good IPA.",MNAle
377,Boelens berrevoesj,2.3,"Belsele, Belgium","Gekregen van mijn nicht op 30-09-2019. En thuis geproefd op 25-01-2020. 
Berrevoesj wordt gebrouwen voor biercafé Berrevoesj in Liedekerke, het is ook een bijnaam die Liedekerke heel lang geleden kreeg omdat de inwoners in die tijd te arm waren om schoenen te kopen, ze moesten dan ook ‘berrevoesj’ (blootvoets) door het leven.
Het is een wazig-blond biertje dat veel wit schuim produceert in een romige vorm wat sterk aan het glas blijft kleven. Je ziet maar weinig fijne CO2 belletjes omhoog parelen. Het schuim zakt naderhand in elkaar tot een fijn laagje van iets meer dan 1 mm dikte met wat grove bellen tussen.
HET AROMA:
Fruitig met op de eerste plaats citrus en dan wat pompelmoes en mout.
DE SMAAK:
Wat hopbitter, citrus en mout
HET MONDGEVOEL:
Volle body met een licht-stoffige textuur en een normale koolzuurprikkeling.
DE NASMAAK:
Vloeit uit en de hopbitterheid blijft toch lang hangen.
HET TOTAALGEVOEL:
Op zijn manier een harmonieus biertje.
HET VERDICT:
Geen geweldig biertje, het is vooral het lichtbittere dat hier de show wil stelen maar na een tijdje wordt die smaak wat wranger. Het lijkt me dat het bittere (IBU 52) hier door iets anders wat getemperd wordt.

Light to medium bodied, with okay carbonation, the taste was similar, finishing a bit dry, coupled with moderate fruity & grainy bitterness.

It's good, but is completely lacking in the subtlety of the original style.

565,Incendiary Lemon Wit,4.3,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Incendiary hits it out of the park on this one. I love this beer. While it's not the prettiest (dull maize with zero head), this ugly duckling has a lot of great qualities. Classic coriander and wheat cracker nose dosed with an aggressive fresh lemon zest on top. The flavors really pop with a long wash at the end of each swallow intensely adding its character to the mix and lifting the bright lemon zest to the forefront. The absolute perfect summertime beer.

566,Incendiary Night Shift,3.0,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina","Night Shift is a seriously weird beer. Points for uniqueness, though it doesn't completely work. The nose is old bong water filtered through charred chicory wood and evergreen needles. Intense oily Mosaic hops lend a bit of motor oil aroma, which is pushed down by the intense woodiness of the Midnight Wheat malt bill. It's a fun beer to power through, if not completely enjoyable.

Yellow pour, nice white head. Something very odd happens when I first taste this beer. It's warm. Or rather, it feels warm. It's straight out of the fridge, and I double-check the bottle temperature. Cold. But it tastes warm. It's so soft and full on the palate without any thickness, stickiness, or richness that it feels like a cask ale. I have no clue how TF they do that. But ok...First sip is a bit sweet, a bit herbal. Chardonnay. Saison loveliness.The palate acclimates. How do you slow down on this beer? It's amazing. A guilty pleasure for the fancy saison set, but so much pleasure and so little guilt. Not a beer I'd bring to tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the subtly of my palate—but totally a beer that I'd bring to a tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the fact that I've got my f'n ear to the f'n rails.

A bubbly colored body radiates with fruity currants and dry textures that   sets itself apart from the usual brut kolsch or IPA. Rather than a bone dry texture of champagne it layers on top a creamy fruit.

FLAVOR / PALATE
The blend of black currant and champagne transform this from the typical brut beer to a dark slightly chewy experience. While still very drinkable it definitely is transformed by the addition of dark fruits. While not my usual choice it does try something new without being a total disaster.",Brigadier
1044,Union Corners Joie de Vivre,3.4,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A playful Belgian influenced IPA takes things in a different direction than the usual release. While it still contains that trademark candi sugar it also adds a more malty tone than most. With releases like this I'll be sure to pay more attention to Union Corners in the future.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A cool base the color of melted chocolate rests under a creamy vanilla head. The laid back core emits waves of malty yeast and candi sugar - almost like an Elephant Ear chased by iced tea. It then melts almost immediately into the background.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Driven mostly by a malty core the blend of iced tea and yeast warm the tongue. A cool texture grounded in mellow sun tea then melts on the throat. There's less bitterness than originally expected though it does enough to be memorable. I'd happily drink a full pint if there were not other options.",Brigadier
1045,Union Corners Seneca's Reserve,3.7,"Madison, Wisconsin","On tap at brewpub

A creamy regional stout shines with promise from first impression to the last sip. I was not sure what to expect at first but it grew on me until I seriously considered ordering a full pour. If this sits around until my next visit I may do so.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Creamy oatmeal cookies soaked in soft fruity coffee warm the air with a gentle nose that soon fades away. The fluid black base dances freely around the glass.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Smoky coffee chased by a spoonful of oatmeal transition gently to a finish of dry cereal. The balanced finish lightens the mood before melting into a cool maltiness. A great benchmark for the brewery as a whole, this well executed stout should give you an idea of whether Union Corners is in your wheelhouse or not.",Brigadier

1115,Beau's Night Märzen,3.5,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","Super crisp bright copper and light amber coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall off-white and tan head. Aroma of bright toffee, earth, grain, caramel, biscuits, deep yeast and a heavy hand of toast and pure malted barley. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grainy and earthy flavours throughout with a small but noticeable dose of alcohol, toffee, caramelised sugars, some peat and a bit of nuts and softer grassy notes at the finale. Aftertaste shows a more defined biscuity, grainy and earthier side of things with a bit of an off-balance between the malt (heavy) and hops (not very noticeable), however the body itself is good for the style and showing things about right, but seems to miss a good deal of complexity from the lager yeast instead of an ale yeast (which is naturally to be expected for the style), but it seems noticeable that this is good but lacking a touch. Overall, a decent beer with a good profile and biting malt and peat flavour that really shows through, especially at the end. I sampled this twenty ounce (one pint, four ounces) Ontario-styled bottle (slim and narrow) purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 02-December-2017 for US$3,99 sampled at home in Washington on 06-July-2018.

1174,Beau's Night Märzen,3.8,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","My Bottom Line :  
This malt lover’s Märzen serves up bread crusts, lightly burnt sugar and chewy barley on a most elegant palate.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the translucent pale amber.
-Soft carbonation and lean residual sugars combine for a easygoing, cuddly mouthfeel.
-Hops are timid throughout. A touch of wooden bitterness in the finish, but that’s it.
-Again, beautifully developed soft malt character in this Beau’s lager.

The flavour is balanced between slight sweetness and slight bitterness. Toasted malts balance with delicate herbal and resinous hops. The flavour becomes slightly more bitter towards the end, leading up towards a clean, malty finish with herbal hops. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a balanced but bland example of a märzen. It could be a lot more complex, both on the malt side and the hop. 2011-12-17",neuromatt

Take a sip and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. This is a full bodied and equally full flavoured example of a Marzen with an excellent lingering bitterness that’ll last until your next mouthful.",Phatman
1210,Beau's Night Märzen,3.8,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","600mL bottle from the LCBO.  Pours a gorgeous clear amber with a good white head.  Aroma is standard decent lager smell.  But the taste - wow!  Big surprise, this is a very full-flavoured lager.  Perfectly balanced notes of caramel, slightly-roasted barley, and delicious hops.  Big body for a lager.  This is  a terrific lager!  Well done, Beau’s.  Oktoberfest is long since over, but I enjoyed with a dinner of sausage with sauerkraut.",kevinsenn
1211,Beau's Night Märzen,3.5,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","I liked this one.  Taste comes strong on the tongue and melts into bitter orange peel.  The problem is I had this after a truly spectacular beer.  The good thing for it is that it wasn’t that disappointing, considering.",solidfunk

App.:  Clear deep amber with a white rim.

Palate:  Medium body, moderate effervescence with some prickly bubbles.
  
Flav.:  Grain/cereal, a little mashy, some wet hay/grass, a little more fruitiness (still quite restrained), some slightly peppery hops, earthy notes, not bad; dry with restrained bitterness and a peppery, biscuit malt finish with hints of fruitiness.

1220,Beau's Night Märzen,3.3,"Vankleek Hill, Ontario","The Festive’Ale the Altbier variation (darker malts, mainly) off the LugTread. Then, consider the NightMarzen like the Marzen’s take off the LugTread. Albeit a really bitter take on the Marzen style. Pours amber. Hops are grassy/earthy. Typical Beau’s Malt (grainy, and somewhat caramelized for the darker ones). All in all -- it’s probably overly bitter for its style, but still a well-made beer if you like that brewer, because they don’t get that much diffrent from the LugTread and the FestiveAle.",MXD

Aroma of toasted grains, amber malt, a hint of earthy hops.  Flavour similar - malt-driven, soft, luxuriously malty, toasty, great mouthfeel from the cask.  Endlessly drinkable.  Has the Beau’s ""house taste"", and at times seems like a fuller-bodied, more complex version of little brother Lug Tread.  Solid brew, glad I finally got to try it.",VeloVampire
