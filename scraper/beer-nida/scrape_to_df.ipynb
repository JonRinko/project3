Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.\n",

Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt.

      "Can from friend. Pours clear golden lots of head and some lacing. Notes are very floral and very fruity, lemon, grain, citrus. Taste light bitter light sweet. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "The Aromas are crackers, Hops, straw and pale malt. Flavors are a little more sweet than light bitter. Very mild, hops and whole home. Okay body. Carbonation and finish. Boulevard could have done better with this.\n",
      "Can from Liberty store. Pours black lots of head and lacing. Notes are milk chocolate, roasted marshmallows, coffee. Big sweet, medium bitter. Creamy body medium carbonation.\n",
      "16 oz draft pours an light orange color with a small white head.  Aromas of citrus, pine, resin, a good old fashioned west coast IPA.  Medium bodied, nicely balanced, a very good beer.\n",
      "12.7 oz corked and caged. About a year and a half old. Aroma is raspberry, Band-Aid, medicinal. Pours slightly hazy ruby red with a crackling, quickly dissipating head. Taste is highly sour (9/10) with flavors of raspberry, lemon; the medicinal and Band-Aid flavors are there in flavor, but not as in your face as in the nose. Flawed but drinkable.\n",
      "Can shared by beerboxer. Pours hazy gold with a nice white head and a citrus aroma. There is a hearty pale malt flavor with a dry finish.\n",
      "It's fine, I was expecting better. Paid a pretty penny for a limited imported run into Australia but isn't really that great in comparison to other milk stouts that are cheaper and more readily available here already. Tastes flat and really lacks in a defining milky taste that you'd expect from a milk stout.\n",
      "Murky golden orange pour with one finger off-white head. Some citrus and fruit in the aroma/flavor. Bright, grassy and a touch zesty. Overall, somewhat muted and one dimensionsal. I enjoyed it but wouldn't go back.\n",
      "On Tap  medium brown color and a find even thin skin of micro bubbles.  Light toasted malts and a gentle soft coffee aroma and flavor.  Very drinkable and a touch of chocolate to go with the coffee.  Probly the best and easiest drinking coffee beer Ive had.\n",
      "Pours pale gold into a stange. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to coat surface. Caramel and hay aromas. Soft with hay, grass and sourdough upfront turning to lemon/lime (?!) in the medium length finish.\n",
      "On Tap.  Classic hazy light golden straw color. Soft wheaty floral, tropical aromas and fa=lavors.  Flowery even.  Soft pillowy finish.  A littel allspice or clove at the end. A bit fancy and pretentious but pleasant and soft.\n",
      "12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.\n",
      "On Tap  Clear medium golden with a  lasting dense white head. Strang clean hard biting piney and somewhat chemically hop bitterness.   Clean dry finish\n",
      "My old man's go to. Very important to get the imported variant rather than the domestically brewed stuff. Although, it's not really that great and I'd have a few choices over it at the price point. A bit bolder than the regular macro lager, but otherwise quite standard.\n",
      "Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours hazy ruddy brown with a slight beige head. Aroma of slight musty oak and brandy. Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt. This is excellent.\n",
      "http://www.ratebeer.com/beer-ratings/0/2/\n",
      "Can smell the cream, pineapple and some coconut. Get mostly cream and some sweet pineapple. Decent.\n",
      "Another lame macro lager. Boring and watery. I don't know why people bother to import this into Australia when there are a billion beers like it already available.\n",
      "16 oz. Aroma is Smarties, Tang, oranges, bready. Pours hazy golden with large-ish chunks of sediment floating around; has a one finger bone-white head with decent retention. Taste has a moderate pithy  bitterness, a light to moderate sweetness, with flavors of Tang and oranges, peel and pulp, vanilla. Not bad.\n",
      "16 ounce can.  Pours black with a decent tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, malt, vanilla, and coconut.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla, coconut, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee.  Nice to sip on.\n",
      "500 ml. bottled 10/29/2019. Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.\n",
      "Keg @ Castle Hotel, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy head.  It's certainly styled well and is crisp with a fair carbonation.  This one is for lager lovers only though.\n",
      "Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Blonde with a creamy head.  It's a very easy textured hoppy ale with some bitterness.\n",
      "An excellent example of a style I really enjoy. Light, crisp with a nice hop profile.\n",
      "Cask @ Jack In The Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Copper-red with a small head.  Has a bittered crisp hoppiness, but not that flavoursome.\n",

      "Well I grabbed this brew from Foothills because I was curious if this was the same beer as the Cottonwood Frostbite winter ale I remember having many years ago at a beer festival. Although apparently Foothills bought out some of Cottonwood’s brands, this beer has a very different profile than what I remember of the Cottonwood rendition. Rather than being a boozy strong ale, this is a brisk clean-finishing and true-to-style black IPA with a fairly light roastiness and a balanced hoppy bitterness. The appearance was excellent also, with a bright white foamy head that almost imitated the cascading presentation of a Guinness stout. Aroma was charred wheat and herbal pacific hops, and the flavor likewise was a balanced mix of roasted malt and fresh bitter hops. Only mild disappointment with this beer was the lack of nuance - no complex chocolate or coffee notes or bold hop flavors - but that being said I enjoyed this and would pick it up again. Not my favorite black IPA, but possibly my favorite offering from Foothills Brewing.\n",

Taste is dry, minimally sweet, minimally bitter, yeasty fruity and bready malty, notes of plum and cherry, dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, some treacle, honey, blue grapes, a touch of apple, baked apple, chestnut and even Brazil nut; minimally warming, alcoholic finish. Relatively watery texture with a minimally slimy touch, slightly prickly carbonation. Rich and complex, definitely a sipper, but partially so light and almost refreshing that you might be teased to speed up the frequency of sips into dangerous areas.

Pours slightly hazy ruby red with a crackling, quickly dissipating head. Taste is highly sour (9/10) with flavors of raspberry, lemon; the medicinal and Band-Aid flavors are there in flavor, but not as in your face as in the nose. Flawed but drinkable.', 'Can shared by beerboxer. Pours hazy gold with a nice white head and a citrus aroma. There is a hearty pale malt flavor with a dry finish.', \"It's fine, I was expecting better. Paid a pretty penny for a limited imported run into Australia but isn't really that great in comparison to other milk stouts that are cheaper and more readily available here already. Tastes flat and really lacks in a defining milky taste that you'd expect from a milk stout.\", \"Murky golden orange pour with one finger off-white head. Some citrus and fruit in the aroma/flavor.

Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad!

Strang clean hard biting piney and somewhat chemically hop bitterness.   Clean dry finish', \"My old man's go to. Very important to get the imported variant rather than the domestically brewed stuff.

Pours hazy ruddy brown with a slight beige head. Aroma of slight musty oak and brandy. Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt.

Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.\", \"Keg @ Castle Hotel, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy head.  It's certainly styled well and is crisp with a fair carbonation.

Medium body and carbonation.', 'Dark black with a large khaki head and nice lacing. Nose is bourbon barrel, banana bread, toffee, and roast. Flavor is really smooth and easy going for the percent. Coconut barrel, fudge, char, and more roasted malt. Medium bodied, and not too sticky for the style.', \"Loved this! Pint with Kieran in the spoons. \\n\\nClassic old ale. Heavy, thick, drinkable with all of these leather touches mixed in with malt and caramel. \\n\\nPours a deep copper, thick stew like. Lovely flavour boarding on a porter with these coffee touches and old furniture. All the same it's drinkable. Very very smooth. \\n\\nTop notch.\", 'On tap at 100 Piv Bratislava. Murky yellow/orange coloured, medium sized white to off-white head, citrus and mild tropical fruits in the nose.

Medium rich roast and caramel malt, dates and figs, light hop bitterness, and a medium dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.', \"Easy sweet pils. \\nPours a lovely golden straw colour with a lasting head. Rich malt smell, toffee touches. A sweet pils for sure. \\n\\nTaste follows, easy pils, not too much to get excited about but it's a quality brew. Would have this again no problem on a hot day.\", '355ml bottle. Amber colour with white head. Big sweet apricot, malty, sweet wheaty, sweet apricot jam, floral, light honey, light citrus, light tartness, light white sugar, light bitterness. Not super complex but v refreshing + drinkable, lots of sweet apricot but not in an artificial way, nice', 'Can. Dark golden, slightly cloudy. Hop aroma with some malt.  Really good. Strong, with good but not the very strong hop flavor many DIPAs have.', 'Draught. Pours clear golden orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Medium herbal coffee, spicy notes, medium dough malt, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.', 'Pours thick black with thin dark tan head.

      "75CL, acquired in 2014 and forgot I had it. Finally opening February of 2020. \"will age for decades\" so let's see :) Dark reddish color, had a 7-up kind of carbonation when I poured it. can smell sweet syrupy brandy from a few feet away. maple syrup, baked apples and cinnamon aroma. wow, this has blended and aged so well. soggy oak, burnt sugar, vanilla, bible paper, ice cream, candied sugar and more apple. little bits of cherry and lovely smokey flavor with an oily grain alcohol finish. Easily the best of the anniversary beers.\n",
      "Can from friend. Pours clear golden lots of head and some lacing. Notes are very floral and very fruity, lemon, grain, citrus. Taste light bitter light sweet. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "The Aromas are crackers, Hops, straw and pale malt. Flavors are a little more sweet than light bitter. Very mild, hops and whole home. Okay body. Carbonation and finish. Boulevard could have done better with this.\n",

      "16 oz draft pours an light orange color with a small white head.  Aromas of citrus, pine, resin, a good old fashioned west coast IPA.  Medium bodied, nicely balanced, a very good beer.\n",
      "12.7 oz corked and caged. About a year and a half old. Aroma is raspberry, Band-Aid, medicinal. Pours slightly hazy ruby red with a crackling, quickly dissipating head. Taste is highly sour (9/10) with flavors of raspberry, lemon; the medicinal and Band-Aid flavors are there in flavor, but not as in your face as in the nose. Flawed but drinkable.\n",
      "Can shared by beerboxer. Pours hazy gold with a nice white head and a citrus aroma. There is a hearty pale malt flavor with a dry finish.\n",
      "It's fine, I was expecting better. Paid a pretty penny for a limited imported run into Australia but isn't really that great in comparison to other milk stouts that are cheaper and more readily available here already. Tastes flat and really lacks in a defining milky taste that you'd expect from a milk stout.\n",
      "Murky golden orange pour with one finger off-white head. Some citrus and fruit in the aroma/flavor. Bright, grassy and a touch zesty. Overall, somewhat muted and one dimensionsal. I enjoyed it but wouldn't go back.\n",
      "On Tap  medium brown color and a find even thin skin of micro bubbles.  Light toasted malts and a gentle soft coffee aroma and flavor.  Very drinkable and a touch of chocolate to go with the coffee.  Probly the best and easiest drinking coffee beer Ive had.\n",

      "On Tap.  Classic hazy light golden straw color. Soft wheaty floral, tropical aromas and fa=lavors.  Flowery even.  Soft pillowy finish.  A littel allspice or clove at the end. A bit fancy and pretentious but pleasant and soft.\n",
      "12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.\n",
      "On Tap  Clear medium golden with a  lasting dense white head. Strang clean hard biting piney and somewhat chemically hop bitterness.   Clean dry finish\n",

      "Can from Liberty store. Pours black lots of head and lacing. Notes are milk chocolate, roasted marshmallows, coffee. Big sweet, medium bitter. Creamy body medium carbonation.\n",
      "Murky golden orange pour with one finger off-white head. Some citrus and fruit in the aroma/flavor. Bright, grassy and a touch zesty. Overall, somewhat muted and one dimensionsal. I enjoyed it but wouldn't go back.\n",
      "Can smell the cream, pineapple and some coconut. Get mostly cream and some sweet pineapple. Decent.\n",
      "16 oz. Aroma is Smarties, Tang, oranges, bready. Pours hazy golden with large-ish chunks of sediment floating around; has a one finger bone-white head with decent retention. Taste has a moderate pithy  bitterness, a light to moderate sweetness, with flavors of Tang and oranges, peel and pulp, vanilla. Not bad.\n",
      "An excellent example of a style I really enjoy. Light, crisp with a nice hop profile.\n",
      "Cask @ City Arms, Manchester.  Fuller hazed yellow-amber with a frothy head.  Has a citrus hoppiness, evident in both aroma and taste.\n",
      "Sampled from the tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy earthy yellow with a white head that dissipates slowly to the edges. Aroma has dank papaya and citrus with a strong onion note supporting. Flavor is onion forward with dank papaya and bitter citrus underlying.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear dark amber with a medium, creamy off-white head, medium retention with good lacing. Moderate grapefruit and resin hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium honey and toast malt with a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Dark black with a large khaki head and nice lacing. Nose is bourbon barrel, banana bread, toffee, and roast. Flavor is really smooth and easy going for the percent. Coconut barrel, fudge, char, and more roasted malt. Medium bodied, and not too sticky for the style.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with a medium, frothy off-white head, short retention. Medium rich roast and caramel malt, dates and figs, light hop bitterness, and a medium dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Can. Dark golden, slightly cloudy. Hop aroma with some malt.  Really good. Strong, with good but not the very strong hop flavor many DIPAs have.\n",
      "Pours thick black with thin dark tan head. Aroma is cocoa, maple syrup, roast and cinnamon. Taste is chocolate, maple syrup and brown sugar, moving to cinnamon and roast. Finish is chocolate, maple syrup and cinnamon.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear yellow with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Medium rich biscuit malt, medium citrus hops and hop bitterness, a clean lager character, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Black appearance with a bubbly tan head. Aroma of toasted oak, roasted malt, bitter chocolate and light earthy notes. Similar flavor, oaky and roasty with mild sweetness and mild bitterness. Medium to full body with a soft feel and a lingering woody finish.\n",
      "Very malt-forward for an American wheat ale, with an outsized toasted bread and caramel backbone overshadowing the more gentle grassy, fruit-tinged notes of the style. Hints of lemon and orange backed up by mild floral hops offset the malt, but it's hard to find much balance or nuance. Not bad, but not what you'd expect.\n",

      "Gold pour, little haze, finger of white head.  Nose is citrus and grain.  Middle is blood orange (not to strong), light berry, some melon, little spice, light kilned malt. Finish is fruity and yeasty.  Nice mouthfeel for the ABV.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with brown highlights and a medium, frothy beige head, medium retention with good lacing. Moderate roast malt, bitter malt and hops, dark fruits of raisins and plums, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "This is one beautiful beer.  Amazing \n",
      "bright clear reddish brown.  Thick off white head.  Plenty of lace.  The rye is in the front in both aroma and flavor.  Lots of resiny pine as well.  Very earthy hop bill. Starts with a bitter smack  Some leathery notes and lots of toffee and caramel malt unfold next. A long earthy bitter fade follows with some citrus and berry notes. Excellent.\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.\n",
      "Keg @ Jack In the Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy-frothy head.  Has a light Helles styling, but is evident enough with perhaps its crispness its best feature.\n",
      "Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Darker brew with a small head. It's not overly fruity but the actual blackberry is evident within its taste.\n",

      "Tap at Hole in The Wall (Raglan outside bar).    Dark brown almost black pour big frothy Guinness like head.  Nose is light earthy chocolate.  Tastes of light malt, rootbeer, roast and hint of dark chocolate.  Thin and dry.   I’m hungover so this is pleasant way to get back into life.\n",
      "750-ml caged and corked bottle purchased at the brewery in Brossard, Quebec, Canada. Pours pitch black yet with the tiniest bit of mahogany hightlights, along with a trace of brown head and lots of clingy lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate, dark dried fruits, smoke. Flavor: espresso, milk chocolate, campfire marshmallows, prunes, raisin bread, date bars, figs, molasses cookies, burnt toast; perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel: full-bodied with a velvety smooth, creamy yet oily finish.\n",
      "Clear rich golden with a thick rocky white head. Nice aroma of sticky dank earthy pineapple and a little piney resin. Crisp bright golden malty flavor with nice pineapple and resiny aromas with little bitterness. Smooth and balanced and quaffable.\n",
      "Cask @ Fox & Goose, Hebden Bridge.  Light golden with a small head.  Hoppy ale with a brooding fruitiness somewhere in the background, and some malty-bitterness in its aftertaste.\n",
      "On Tap at the Boise brewery/taproom.  Hazy deep orange light amber with a thin wispy soapy of white head.  Some deep resinous piney hops in the aromas and flavors. Big citrus pithiness as well.  Late light malty cereal flavors.   Medium bodies and a little ABV burn in there.\n",
      "Draught. Pours opaque jet black with a medium, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate rich chocolate, toffee, and caramel malt, sweet cinnamon and vanilla, tobacco notes, dark fruits, and a sweet finish. Full body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "16 oz can from Total Wine and More in Short Pump, VA  No brewer name on the label  This was a difficult beer to classify.  Others have it as a Sour -Weisse.  The sour poured a cloudy amber color with a big white head that quickly dissipated.  The sour aroma of beer but really on the best I have had. The sour has a medium body with soft carbonation.  The finish is clean with a mouthfeel of pleasant sourness.\n",
      "Delt med Rune på rom 410 Premier Inn Waterloo, Birmingham. Svart. Middels høyt lysebrunt skum som daler sakte og etterlater litt lacing. Lakrisaroma. Silkemyk munnfølelse. Smaken nøtter & sjokolade. Tørr avslutning. Litt alkohol kommer fram.\n",

      "On tap at Big Dog's, I assume the pom in the name refers to pomegranate as this had a nice light fruit flavor. Definitely didn't see the 9%.  I liked this quite a bit, but I have a bias towards pomegranate beer.\n",
      "On tap at Big Dog's, this was super sweet. The sugar was just off the charts. A bit creamy but just too sweet to enjoy.  A rare miss for Able Baker, imo.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A very dark brown beer with a beige head. Aroma of bourbon, rum Barrel, dark roasted malt. Taste of dark roasted malt, coffee, burned malt rum barrel.\n",

Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry tart finish. Flavors of straw, apples, light nuttiness and light citrus with a crisp dry tart lingering apple finish.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy amber color with white head. Aroma is juicy fruits, oxidized, peach. Taste is sweet creamy, juicy fruits. Oily mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not for me.\n",

      "Cask at By the Horns Brewery, Summerstown.  A light golden bitter.  These Bullian hops are a little spicy and savoury, which gives the beer a fairly unusual flavour.  I just think it’s a bit too weak a beer to properly balance out the hop flavours.\n",

      "Aroma : Light caramel malt, unusual sweet orange note rather than citrus orange.  Taste : Malt is sublte, sweet orange comes through and although not overpowring, for me lacks some bittering balance. Still an o.k. beer though (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",

      "On tap at Champps in Brookfield. 2019 version! Very dark brown pour. Aroma has sweet barrel, cinnamon, some chiles, sweet malts. Taste is of cinnamon, sweet barrel, cherry, sweet malts, and tangy chiles. Well done and tasty. The chiles provide a solid heat. Medium to full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is good. This does not have the typical Darkness full body, but still solidly supports the barrel & chiles. Unsure how this would age. Lovin the cinnamon/barrel taste blend. Finishes sweetly, with barrel & cinnamon. This has an interesting blend. Multi dimensional with the chiles. Still would like more of the typical Darkness thickness. 16.3\n",

      "On tap at Champps in Brookfield - In a teku! Go Tony ... Unclear orange pour. Orange, pineapple, tropical fruit mousse with a solid dry hop presence. Super hoppy. Juicy. Pale malts. Bitter-sweet fruity finish. This is really good; hoppy, juicy, tasty. 16.6\n",
      "12oz can from Three Cellars in the Falls. Dark brown pour with reddish tints. Aroma has sweet malts, berry, chocolate, and pastry filling. Taste is thicker than expected; sweet malts, raspberry, cream. Well blended and fairly tasty, staying away from getting too sweet. Medium bodied or a bit more. Finishes to the sweet side of bittersweet. Enjoyed this more than expected. 14.2\n",
      "Taster at the Mothership. Pours a hazy, straw color, with a big, frothy, white head. A little lime juice, cream, lemon peel, vanilla, and a lot of floral notes. Very sweet and phenolic. Smooth, light, and silky. Delicious!\n",

      "473 ml can from the brewery. Pours a murky rhubarb colour with small pinkish head.  Aroma is tart raspberry, lemon and grains.  Flavour has tart candyish raspberry, lemon and mellow grains.  Lighter carbonation.  Decent.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from the brewery. Pours a hazy dark brown with amber highlights and a layer of oil atop the liquid. The head quickly vanishes. Notes of peanut butter, chocolate, toasted marshmallows, fudge, vanilla, roast, oak, and bourbon. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a roasty, nutty, sweet, warming, slightly flat mouthfeel. A little messy and could use more carb, but the aroma is all roasted peanuts and that's fun. Somehow this one is more peanut buttery than others; I guess these particular adjuncts enhance that aspect.\n",

      "Ohh, nice Enigma.  Tap. Pours hazy yellow,  small white head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is enigma,  perfume,  fresh pine needles,  tangerine.  Flavor is light sweet,  light bitter,  juicy.  Medium body.\n",
      "500 ml bottle via trade. Pours a deep, dark, basically opaque brown with a small tan head that settles into a ring and a thin loop of film. Notes of chocolate, vanilla, strawberries, bourbon, oak, soy, figs, and roast. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a flat, sweet, tangy, and warming mouthfeel. It'd be better without the strawberry and with some carbonation. It's messy.\n",
      "Taster at the Mothership. Pours black, with a small, tan ring. The nose is big vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, milk chocolate, and some toasted oak. Very sweet and decadent, with a touch of bitterness. Lovely.\n",

      "Pours dark brown, aroma and upfront taste is a brownie but way too much smoke and charcoal flavor at the end, tap at brewery.\n",
      "Pours an amber with thick white head and heavy lacing.  Lots of malt on the nose.  Mouthfeel is very heavy with pronounced bitterness.  Nuts, molasses and some metal taste.  Lasting bitter finish.\n",
      "Nice hops bitter flavor and palate. Hazy deep yellow. Aroma is hops with some lactose. Flavor is sweet and fruity. Tap at brewery\n",
      "Finally getting around to this a couple months late. Pours near black with frothy brown foam that settles to a thin cap, moderate lacing. Aromas are simpler than expected, mostly sweet malt, mild ginger snap and a touch of coffee. Flavors bring a vanilla sweetness to the forefront, combining with the roast character, and not much in the way of ginger snap. Very pleasant and easy drinking smoothness. Medium-light mouthfeel and a fairly clean finish. Will try again next year for sure!\n",
      "Tap. Pours clear black,  small beige head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is light,  roasty,  mocha,  ash, more roast. Flavor is light plus sweet,  lighter bitter,  roasty.  Medium body,  soft mouthfeel,  low carbonation.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, long retention with good lacing. Moderate fruity and pine hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bread and dough malt, light alcohol, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "Tap. Pours clear hazel,  small beige head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is roast,  nutty,  dark toast,  a hint of wood,  earth.  Flavor is light plus sweet,  minimal bitterness,  nice roasty notes.  Medium body,  smooth. Good.\n",
      "Tap. Pours hazy golden orange,  small off white head,  some lacing.  Aroma is light,  armpit,  coconut,  odd. Flavor is light plus sweet,  very light bitter,  green coconut.  Light plus body,  low carbonation.  Ug\n",
      "Tap. Pours clear golden,  small white head,  good lacing.  Aroma is grain,  citrus,  a bit floral.  Flavor is light sweet,  light plus bitter.  Light body.\n",
      "16 oz can pours an almost clear deep golden color with lasting off-white head that leaves some lacing.  Aroma has pine, apricot, lemon, citrus hops, and sugar.  Taste is sweet, despite the hoppiness.  Body is medium to full with perfect carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel.  I was surprised to see Schell's try something like this and sold in 16 oz. four-packs.  The can says \"A transitional miniseries in four parts\", so I hope to find the subsequent episodes.\n",
      "Pours a deep, dark brown with a finger of tan foam that settles to a ring, no lacing. Aromas of roast malt and a slight sweetness. Flavors are more abundant with a nice sweet toffee dominating among biscuit and mild nut presence. This is how I like brown ales - with low hop bitterness and focus on the malt. Well done!\n",
      "On Tap at the Boise brewery/taproom  Crystal clear deep golden with a touch of orange.  Thin wispy off white skin od micro bubbles. Faint very light pale malts in the aroma.  big grassy floral hop character. Feels pretty light for 7%  Well attenuated.  LIght clean finish.\n",
      "Hazy deep yellow with small white head.  Aroma hay, citrus and tropical fruit.  Medium body.  Mildly bitter, some sweet juice but more on the grassy than fruit bomb side.  Found this one with a bit more intensity of flavor than their other offerings.\n",

      "Can into tulip. Nice straw color with some haze. Pineapple and pine notes. Mild bitterness. Decent.\n",
      "Yellow-orange, small white head.  Aroma is straightforward hops and malt, medium light body.  Flavor is mildly bitter, some malt balance, some citrus and pine, generic and acceptable.\n",
      "Cloudy orange yellow.  Grassy hop aroma.  Medium body.  Alcohol well hidden.  Mildly bitter, touch of citrus and herbal hops.  It's fine.  Unmemorable.\n",
      "Hazy yellow, small white head.  Aroma on the malty side.  Medium light body.  Some up front bitterness then gets a bit sweet but without the hop intensity to balance, but finishes a little better on the dry side.  Decent, style not really as advertised.\n",
      "Had on tap at Tenaya Creek, this was delicious. Quite hazy, a ton of grapefruit flavors with a little orange.  This is the Stone quality I remember but had been missing in some recent average beers. This one is top notch! Tasty tasty.\n",
      "Dark brown with small tan head.  Aroma roasted and sweet malt.  Medium light body.  Flavor is off dry, lightly sweet malt with toasty finish.  Solid.\n",
      "This was a pretty run of the mill.  Not a ton of bittering hops, okay flavor.  Nothing special or memorable.\n",
      "Poured a hazy, light yellow colour with a bright white, creamy head. Minimal lacing. Light bouquet on the nose. With scents of cereal and light hops. First swig was really quite thin with watery flavours of very light hops, honey and a little nuts. Finish is quite plain with minimal lingering flavours.\n",
      "Dark brown with small tan head.  Aroma chocolaty malt and dark fruit.  Medium light body.  Lightly sweet flavor.  It's somewhat on the lighter and fruitier style for a stout, not necessarily a bad thing, although somewhat lacking in richness.\n",
      "Fresh can, pours a murky, but not soupy orange color with creamy head. Nose and flavor are Mango, residual sugar, lime, grape, fruit punch, orange blossom honey, and a touch of astringent booze in the finish. ITs pretty juicy and better than most doubles, but I think it needs a good 4-6 weeks like most cans. Medium bodied.\n",
      "Draft at Bru Craft. Unexpected cloudy amber pour. Slim coat of soft off-white foam. No lace. Malty brew with some dark citrusy hops and faint florals. Poppyseed bagels. Cassia. Tangelos. Cloves. Not sure I have the right beer. Had them check and they assured me it's the right keg. Feels vaguely Belgian but not like a Saison at all.\n",
      "Sampled at P house, didn't know Bolero was making real beer styles that don't cause diabetes. Clears golden with medium head. Not as bad as i expected it would be but theres some champagne type yeast notes and a touch of weird spice. Still happy to see a non lactose, pesticide fruit ridden, offering from BS.\n",
      "Hazy orange appearance with pink hues and a white head. Enticing aroma of strawberry jam, fresh vanilla, tart fruits, mild funk and light grain. Similar flavor, juicy, tart and sweet with pleasant acidity. Light body with a refreshing strawberry finish. Wow.\n",
      "Dark brown appearance with a lingering tan head. Aroma of caramel malt, chocolate, mild oak, light bourbon and hints of fruit. Similar flavor, rich, malty and layered with lingering sweetness, a full body and a warming finish. Very nice.\n",
      "Draft at Bru Craft. Foggy reddish orange pour with a slim dense cover of soft off-white foam. Gently tart. Cherries and oak up front. Plums. Raspberries. Currants. Kaffir lime leaves. Feels like real fruit. Juicy but not quite full. Modestly complex. Dry balanced finish.\n",

      "Multiple 16 ounce cans served at the brewery. Flavor comes off danky and mild citrus like, maybe white grape hints. Some straw, bready malt. Bitterness is mild. Pretty good balance. Above average.\n",
      "Not sure exactly which style to put this under, but the combination and the adjuncts sweetened up this level and basically made it taste a bit like creme brulee.  Sweet, but good, but sweeter than what I was craving last night.\n",
      "16 oz draft at the brewery. Holy shit pineapple!  I love the aroma! A soft touch of pine in the finish. Soft herbs. Lower bitterness level. After drinking a bunch of this it becomes a little rindy and pulppy. Just ok for me.\n",
      "Cask at Hogshead, Wolverhampton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours almost black with a tight cream head.  Nose has a hint of chocolate, but not much else.  In the mouth it has a creamy texture with coffee and cherries featuring in different areas.  Finish is creamy and slightly bitter.  Extremely drinkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottle at Beer Dock, Crewe.  Barrel aged in bourbon barrels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is strongly cocoa, plus alcoholic strength.  Pours completely black with a very dark brown transient head.  In the mouth the alcohol is to the  fore, but there is also cocoa, chocolate and hints of chilli.  Finish is boozy with a warming glow !  One for sipping slowly methinks.\n",

      "14 ounce snifter draft at The Hidden Pig, Haverhill, MA. Flavor shows me grapefruit, mild herbs, malt is mildly sweet. ABV  is lightly noticeable. A tad above average.\n",

      "This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "The deep reddish base and lean white head rest easily in the glass. Medicinal anise, dark fruit, and cranberry force their way into focus before slowly melting away into a mellow memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic. As a result it is hard to recommend this unless you really need to rate everything on the menu.\n",
      "On tap at brewpub\n",
      "\n",
      "With kviek popping up more often I took the opportunity of ordering this barleywine as soon as I saw it on the menu. In this case it creates a unique experience ideal for a winter warmer. Give it some consideration if you are at the brewpub.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Cool earthy tomato and malt ground the textures of caramel and noble hops. Even the cool coppery base and lean ivory head help tether this with a warm inviting presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Creamy oak, vanilla, and earthy almonds transition to a profile of dry sherry. The soothing warm finish glows on the back of the throat. The hops accent a well balanced experience that might be the best draft at Vintage right now.\n",
      "On tap at brewpub\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical New England style IPA, this polished example of the style stands out as a drinkable and accessible version that can help further understand the thought behind it. I can't say that I will be sad when hazy IPAs are in the rear view mirror but until then if most are at this level then I can enjoy the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Yeast, mango, and tropical fruit salad sticks in the air with a dense texture similar to sweet fog. If you look up the definition of the style this would be very close to ideal. The citrusy body clouds the glass like unfilitered pureed lemons decorated by a layer of white frosting.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Creamy vanilla yogurt infused with mango and oranges radiates on the tongue. The cool transition ebbs into a thick smoothie profile and eventually a vibrant bitterness. From start to finish it provides a hook that shines the stage light on a polished release. Drafts like this show that Vintage is not resting on their laurels.\n",

      "A local sour fuses Wisconsin cranberries with a tangy essence to create a middle of the road kettle sour. If you enjoy your cranberry juice more abrasive than normal then source this or something like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Dried cranberries and tart cherry pits tickle the senses. A mild fruity undercurrent is crisp and tart though not intensely abrasive like something from Funk Factory. Even the semitransparent reddish core resembles a cranberry influenced mocktail.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Tart cranberry lined with salty Sour Patch Kid sugar scour the tongue clean. The texture becomes more abrasive over time as it lingers in the throat. Compared to others it might be somewhat pedestrian but it does enough to be a worthwhile experience.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A hazy dark golden beer with a white head. Aroma of orange fruits, grapefruit, fresh citrusy hops. Taste of bitter orange fruits, zest, grapefruit, long bitter finish.\n",

      "The looks of the beer are nice. It is a decent looking Belgian Blond. The colour is a nice golden yellow, with a pleasant amber touch. It glows golden. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice smooth layer of white foam is formed. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. It looks very pleasant. \n",
      "The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a typical Belgian Ale. The malts are nice and a bit caramel and also fruity. Touch of bread is there too. Very pleasant. The hops are floral and a bit herbal. The floral bouquet goes well with the malt notes. The herbal notes go well with the yeast aromas. These are spicy and also fruity, with some typical notes of banana. Very pleasant. \n",
      "The taste of the beer also is very nice. It is perfectly balanced. The malts are sweet and the creamy yeast gives an extra nice smooth touch to this. The hops are nice and bitter. The bitters and sweets are in perfect harmony. Really good. ",
      "The palate of the beer is nice too. Medium body, smooth texture and very nice high carbonation. The finish of the beer is nice and is filled with smooth and subtle floral and herbal hop notes and some of that spicy yeast. All in all, a very nice beer. Absolutely more towards the top of the specter than the bottom. I like it.\n",

Aroma is full of lacto upfront, with everything else taking a backseat - there’s some floral hops in there, but they’re drowned out by the yogurt.

This is quite good given how light it has to be, but that lightness prevents me from enjoying it enough to give it a higher score.\n",

      "Cans from GS brew pub store, neat label. Pours a golden amber with a creamy head. Smooth delicate and fresh - citrus peel and grass and smooth malt and candy citrus/pale fruit. Nice mingling citrus flavors in the finish, kind of like 3-fruit marmalade but with a snappy fresh dryness. What balance. Aroma has a whiff of the freshest mandarin.\n",
      "Can (10/29/19) pour. Appearance is orange-yellow with tons of effervescent sparkle, finger-width foamy white head with decent retention and mildest lacing. Aroma is strong, sweet fruit, spicy. Taste is passionfruit, citrus bite. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, lively carbonation (biting the tongue), hint of alcohol warmth deep in the esophagus and finish as taste. Overall, strong and enjoyable aroma and flavor but not complex. Hops just out of peak freshness so may be better fresh.\n",
      "Can from brewery. Pours hazy mango some head and lots of lacing. Notes are candy, some mango, floral. Medium bitter medium juicy sweet. Full sticky body lively carbonation.\n",
      "16 ounce can.  Pours black with an average brown head.  Aroma of chocolate, coffee, and spice.  Taste is roasted malt, chocolate, Chai, coffee, and spice.  Spicy and different.\n",
      "It is clear straw with a white head. It has grape elements with lemon, earth, leather, and spice. It is dry.\n",
      "It pours clear yellow with a white head. It has potato flavors with grain, a bit of vanilla, and slight herbal.\n",
      "It is very dark brown with a brown head. It has chocolate, roast, cocoa, vanilla, and vinous flavors. It is very smooth.\n",
      "Very dark brown with a brown head. Chocolate, roast, cocoa, bourbon, and vanilla. It is very smooth.\n",
      "It is clear yellow with a white head. It has grapefruit with citrus and rind. It has moderate bitterness.\n",
      "This stout poured a deep black colour with a huge, creamy brown head. Beautiful lacing. Scents include light coffee, nuts, roasted malts and smoke. First swig was bold. Really bold. Heavy roasted flavour with tastes of pure coffee grounds and light smoke. Not very sweet, but those roasted malts are delicious. Finish is pure burnt with that dark roast coffee flavours lingering forever.\n",
      "It is yellow with a white head. It has some spruce with herbs. It is a bit woody as well.\n",
      "Bottle - American strong might be the best overall classification for this, but it reads really British in character to me - hazy ruby - rich earthy (maybe some golden promise and marris) sweet malt similar to a scotch ale - moderate spiciness, dark bread, caramelized sugars - moderate bitterness, more American in character, finishes - hearty and warming - very good.\n",
      "473ml can. Opaque, quasi black colour with small to average, forth yto creamy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, tan head. Sweet-ish, chocolately dark malty and spicy aroma, notes of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate sauce, some vanilla, cinnamon, peppery spicy and minimally smoky whiffs of chipotle. Taste is sweet, chocolately dark malty and spicy, notes of cinnamon and vanilla, peppery spicy, minimally smoky notes of chipotle bring that typical effect of increasing, accumulating hotness. Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, completely hidden alcohol. Exactly what it wants to be (Mexican Hot Chocolate) but not in an Imperial way; spiciness really pushes the envelope without crossing the line to discomfort. Pretty good.\n",
      "On tap at the Only Cafe.  Pours a clear golden colour with plus-sized white head.  Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits with some sweet maltiness.  Flavour is orange, grapefruit and floral happiness with sweet biscuity maltiness.  Modest bitterness in finish.  Nice.\n",
      "From a pint can. Pours a hazy straw with an off white head. Aromas are dank hay. Flay\n",

      "Flavors are moderately bitter citrus and tropical fruits.\n",
      "440ml can from We Brought Beer, Balham.  Clear deep golden.  Aroma is piney and with a certain crispness.  It’s quite malty and quite crisp.  Kind of ticks all the boxes of west coast, but without really ticking them.  This means that it is actually more quintessential than you think. ￼\n",
      "Can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom. 11-20-19 canning. Pushing the limits on hop freshness on this one! But it all works out in the end! Aroma: bold tropical fruit, soft malt. Flavor has strong tropical fruit, mild grassy, and a light malt backbone. Clearly the best beer I ever had from this brewery. Glad they finally stepped up their game!\n",
      "16 oz can from Joe Canal's, 2/4/20.  Canned 12/5/19.  Pours a murky yellowish color, decent off-white head, moderate lace.  Aroma is lemon-lime, grass, pale malts, and a little dough.  Some light citrus notes as well.  Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.  \n",

Medium sweetness, minimal tartness. Moderate body, slight clammy texture, soft carbonation. Above average for this style of cider.\n",
      "4/2/2020. Bottle sample courtesy of danlo, cheers Ed! Pours cloudy yellow gold with a small bubbly white head. Aroma of bourbon, semi-sweet apples, wood, citrus. Light sweetness and medium sour. Moderate body, slight oily texture, average carbonation. Dry, light tart, woody bourbon finish. Not particularly keen on the bourbon in this one.\n",
      "On draught at the taproom during the \"Streetside 3 Year Anniversary Bash!\" on 09/28/2019. Cloudy bright reddish burnt sienna color with a medium thin frothy off-white head that diminishes gradually to a film. Short strings of lace. Aroma of tropical fruits, wheat and malt. Light-bodied with flavors of pineapple, wheat, passionfruit and biscuit malt. The finish is a fruit juice cocktail. Pretty good overall.\n",

Moderate sweetness and light to moderate tartness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, above average carbonation. Dry, tangy tart finish. Nice.\n",
      "Sample at the taproom during the \"Streetside 3 Year Anniversary Bash!\" on 09/28/2019. Slightly hazy reddish-orange color with a medium thin white head that dissipates quickly to a wispy film. Short strings of lace. Aroma of herbal yeast, fruit, tea and malt. Medium body with flavors of mildly funky yeast, sweet-tart melon, green tea, vinous oak and doughy malt. The finish is oaky, funky and tart with a fruity yeast aftertaste. Good beer all around.\n",

      "Got this scary can from JRs. Was not looking forward to this tick. After all, it says it has some artificial flavors in it. Pours clear pale from a pounder can.  Smell is somewhat artificial apple, like hardtack candy. Taste is as expected, somewhat rude ass artificial apple candy with a vanilla backbone. Cannot get this. It also has a warming sensation as it goes down the gullet. Can't say I'm disjointed because I didn't expect much. I had high hopes for the Blockhouse brand but I'm afraid they are just turning into another alky laced soda pop brand. This stuff is more on the line of those kindah malt beverages, has little to do with beer, thanks. I'm going to mix the rest of this with a can of IC light to try to straighten it out a bit and make it more acceptable. Whew.\n",

      "Disappointed with this one. Strange appearance with parts that are clear and other parts that are cloudy. Very unusual. Aromas are hops, caramel malt and solvents. Flavors are similar to nose, sweet up front with good carbonation to balance with low bitterness but that increases a little at the end. Don't really pick up much of the El Dorado hop variety.\n",

Aroma is juicy citrus (orange, grapefruit) and tropical fruits (pineapple, mango), cereal grain, honey and floral notes. Taste is more juicy citrus and tropical fruits, hints of stonefruit, cereal grain, floral notes, light onion and pine. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with velvety carbonation and a long, drying finish that is moderately bitter. Fruity and creamy. Nice\n",

The head recedes fairly quickly, leaving great-looking strings of lacing around the glass. After just a few minutes, the head is a cap with mounds of thick bubbles.\n",

      "Taste is different; taking me a bit to characterize it. The pineapple and tropical fruits from the aroma are there, and strongly so, but the taste at the forefront is interesting, very nice and enjoyable, but hard for me to describe (I checked some other reviews - they were no help... maybe it's just me...) \n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good tasting beer, despite my lack of words to describe it.  There is some cracker malt presence behind the fruit flavors. A moderate bitterness begins a few seconds after each taste, that grows stronger and lingers into the aftertaste. This is not WC IPA level of bitterness, or even a Midwest IPA level, but more than sufficient to meet expectations for an IPA. The bitterness grows as you drink the beer.\n",

Light to medium bodied, with okay carbonation, the taste was similar, finishing a bit dry, coupled with moderate fruity & grainy bitterness.

      "Tall skinny bottle shared. The mead is a clear gold color. Still. The aroma has sweet fruity components with a touch of floral and doughy character peeking through every so often. Fairly sweet overall. I was curious if I could detect any blueberry since the mead is just made from the blueberry blossom honey, but I couldn’t. Very tasty and interesting otherwise.\n",

      "Pale amber with a light pink highlight. Aroma is light and spicy. Some faint clove, pale malt and a touch of fruit. The flavour has more vineousness .

Lots of weed like hops in the aroma with smoky camp fire. Taste is very complex with lots of flavors coming in. Oily pine hops. Dark smoky malts. Medicinal.

      "Can. Pours clear reddish orange with a small, frothy off-white head, short retention. Moderate tart and acidic blackberries, light mineral character, light malt, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "22oz bottle pours out black topped with a small tan head. Nose is sweet vanilla chocolate bourbon barrel notes. Taste is more of the nice sweet chocolate bourbon barrel vanilla wow total cake.\n",
      "Bottle at share, from Steve. Silky black pour, flat, oily. Sweet aroma, chocolate, vanilla. Taste comes in like a milky way bar. Sweet, succulent , full. ABV evident,  but not overpowering.\n",
      "Draft pours mostly clear golden with a medium white head. Aroma is bready, grassy and floral hops. Flavor is typical but well done, bready, grassy, crisp, light sweet and bitter. Medium light and crisp feel. Good for the style.\n",
      "Draft at Barebottle. Hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is vanilla, sugared grapefruit, tangerine, mango. Flavor is sweet lacto citrus and tropical milkshake with vanilla. Medium plus body, tasty but I’m still undecided on beers like this in general.\n",
      "Can, courtesy of Ben. Pours pinkish red. Raspberry, floral, lemon juice, zest, salt, doughy. Medium body. Decent.\n",
      "16 oz. can. Hazy deep orange. Small white head. Smells of passion fruit, grapefruit, and sweet tropical fruits. Tastes pretty much the same. Acidic passion fruit hops, grapefruit, and sweet fruity hops. Sweet pale malt. Surprising grapefruit bitterness in the finish. A little bit of yeast earthy bitterness too. Medium body. Not my favorite, but it's fine.\n",
      "$4.00 pint can, WW. Slightly hazy gold with a soft off-white head. Tangerine, orange peel, Flintstones vitamin nose. Caramel, vanilla, orange peel, tropical fruit. Juicy and somewhat sweet. Lots of sweet caramel in there. Nice.\n",
      "Draft at Barebottle. Hazy orangish with a small white head. Aroma is interesting, ginger beer, cinnamon, lime, passion fruit. Flavor is somewhat sweet and somewhat tart, quite interesting, spiced, tropical, limey. Medium body with a decently crisp feel. Interesting at the very least.\n",
      "375 mL bottle. Pours a little cloudy and slightly pink. Like a clear grapefruit juice. Smells of stone fruit, french oak, faint dried grass, and some light cheesy funk. Tastes of peaches, french oak, dried grass. Peaches are kinda sweet. Back end has a little bit of cheesy funk. Pretty good, but the French Oak character is as strong here as it ever is in Odd Breed beers.  Usually I find it to be a nice aspect of their beer, but here it seems distracting from the idea of the beer.\n",

      "Pours a hazy, lemon-gold color, with minimal head. Aroma has citrus and tropical fruit notes, and an alcohol burn that singed my nose hairs! Flavor follows, with a pronounced alcohol burn that really undercuts things.These might be fun experiments for the brewer, but is there anyone who really wants to drink them?\n",

      "Can pour (canned no later than mid December, ‘19) from Twelve Percent, North Haven. Appearance is opaque yellow (juicy) with no sparkle, ring of off-white head and no lacing. Aroma is sweet lemon (like a meringue pie) and maybe a hint of pineapple. Taste is sweet lemon and light pineapple as aroma but balance by a pretty strong bitter. Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with thin, smooth, frothy texture, soft-to-average carbonation and finish as taste with lingering mild bitterness. Overall, nice aroma and flavor, so in enjoyable, though hard to find the base blonde/golden ale here. Drinks more like a good session IPA.\n",

Middle follows suit with mango, mild pineapple, little papaya, some citrus zest.  Finish is juicy with a little kick.  Could be hops could be alcohol, either way satisfying.\n",

Maybe a little worty, chalky. Definitely not your standard red/amber. Tastes more like an American Pale Ale verging on IPA.

      "Deep Ruddy brown pour. Hazy with a thick off-white head. The aroma is lovely. Earthy hops. A bit of toffee and treacle along with a sweet malt base. Slightly sticky but well-balanced by woodsy/earthy hops. Chewy and a bit sticky. Alcohol kind of helps thin the body. Made for a winter day like today.\n",
      "473 ml can from the brewery.  Pours a cloudy golden colour with moderate-sized white head.  Aroma is clove, coriander, bubblegum and a little banana.  Flavour is quite spicy with some apple/pear, banana and grains. Carbonation on the livelier side.  Ok.\n",
      "31/1/2020. Cask at the 13th Colchester Winter Ale Festival. Pours almost black with a bubbly off-white head. Aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, chocolate, nut, coffee and caramel. Light to moderate sweetness, moderate roasted bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily and creamy texture, soft carbonation. Decent brew, though didn't seem like 6%.\n",
      "Very floral aroma. Some coriander, gale,  lavender and a bit of fruit. Light lemon citrus and a dry herbal/fruity note. Light white pepper. Drying finish. There’s a lot going on in here... comes across gruit-like. I like it though.\n",
      "31/1/2020. Cask at the 13th Colchester Winter Ale Festival. Pours clear mid-brown with a bubbly off-white head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, fruit, touch of spice, caramel and coffee. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Sweet cakey finish.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Coalhouse, Seaham. Deep red colour, no head and aroma of berries, tea, apple. Taste is sweet, blackcurrant, berries, apple, woody, barrel, oaky, formic hints, some tartness and drying tannin. Oily mouthfeel, medium bodied, low carbonation, medium-dry tart berry finish.

Aroma is intensely appley, medium sweet, touch of caramel, light cooking apples and brown sugar. Medium sweetness, light tartness. Medium body, slight oily texture, soft to flat carbonation. Very nice.\n",

      "29/1/2020. Cask at the 13th Colchester Winter Ale Festival. Pours almost black with minimal head. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, light roasted malt, and the slightest hint of rum. Medium sweetness, very light bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, soft to flat carbonation. Easy drinking, lightly roasted, chocolate finish.\n",
      "29/1/2020. From Bag in a Box at the 13th Colchester Winter Ale Festival. Pours slightly hazy golden with a small bubbly off-white head. Aroma of medium sweet apples, lightly funky with a dash of citrus. Moderate sweetness, light tartness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, average to soft carbonation. Nice tart and sweet mix to finish.\n",
      "A hazed faint pinkish ale with a thin off white head. In aroma, sweet fruity malt with grassy herbaceous hops, light raisins, light lactic notes, pleasant. In mouth, a nice sweet fruity malt with light grape skin, light acidic notes, Epsom salts, pleasant. On tap at Vices et versa.\n",
      "Draft to taster in a flight at Hoppin Vines shared by Tmoney99. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. The aroma and flavor have pale and sweet malts, mild citrus, vanilla,  pithy, earthy, mild to moderate bitterness.\n",
      "10 oz. at the brewery. This is a brilliant red with good head retention. Pleasant robust aroma displays sharp, woody hop character with a touch of citrus and a hefty malt profile of toffee, cacao, and sweet breads. The mouthfeel is full and the sweetness is appropriate, while not excessive. Plenty of bitterness gives balance. This is really well executed, I enjoyed this one much more than their Isolation. I think beefing up everything is a big improvement in this case. Berries, musty basement, toffee, faint espresso, and citrus are the lasting impressions.\n",
      "Bottle picked up from Biervana, München and consumed at home Attenkirchen, Sunday 2nd February 2020 whilst in the midst of a day of cooking, we've made Cream of Cauliflower Soup, Red Lentil and Tomato Soup, Granola, a large Hungarian Goulash, Roasted a Pork Joint and also making Potatoes and Smoked Garlic. We're listening to Balthazar - Rats. Beer hazy light amber with a filmy white head. A little bit of an appley edge to the bitterness, soft mouthfeel, even a hint of smokiness? Good bitterness,a touch of toffee, citrus, its good. I've not had many beers from this brewery and understand that they have folded now which is very sad.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Ernies in Lexington. A dark pour with the same kind of Hershey's chocolate syrup in other beers they've done and a lot of peanut butter\n",
      "Draught (Dancing Man, Southampton) - Copper red in colour. Blackcurrant, pine, grapefruit and caramel all feature prominently in both the aroma and in the relatively bitter and fruity taste.\n",
      "Bottle at Pien. Black color, beige head. Bitter taste with roasted malts, nuts, hops, coffee, chocolate, leather and a bit of licorice. Bitter finish with roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, licorice, hops and nuts. Excellent imperial porter.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Fresh, quite hoppy and roasty with loads of grass, pine, hints of coffee, fruits, chocolate and dry bitterness. Quite well balanced and tasty hoppy porter / black IPA, just the way I like them\n",
      "Pours with a good deep clear copper body and nice foam, the aroma is nice fresh raspberry with tannin hints. Flavour is semi smooth raspberry with a bit of cloying sugar on the back end. Mouthfeel isn't great, flavour is however, which makes this thing kind of nice but also a bit of a wash.\n",
      "There's excellent peat on the nose reminiscent of a fine scotch, Lagavulin to be exact. Has no foam and a muddy brown body. Flavour is excellent peat, weedy and fresh, unlike any I've found in a beer. That's all that's there though, other elements could come forward too. There's lingering peat on the tongue and good carbonation. This is excellent for a peat beer, highly noteable for how it's done though it dominates everything about the brew.\n",
      "Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark brown with a light brown head that dissipates slowly to the edges. Aroma has notes of cinnamon and booze with bread and a bit of sweet grains backing. Flavor has sweet grains, whiskey and cinnamon with a bit of earthy vanilla in the finish.\n",
      "Soft grain on the nose, has creamy foam on a cloudy yellow body. Flavour is chewy sweet grain, a bit more substantial than your usual pale lager. Full mouthfeel. A decent craft lager.\n",
      "Sampled from the tap at the brewery. Pours a clear light gold with a white head that dissipates slowly to the edges. Aroma has earthy citrus and grass with a bit of straw and hay backing. Flavor combines earthy grass and citrus with grain and bread backing.\n",

The aroma and flavor have pale malts, lightly toasted, grapefruit citrus, resiny, caramel, moderate bitterness, definitely get the West Coast character from this, dry, citrusy, solid bitterness, solid.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Ultramørk rødbrun/svart. Filmskum med litt farge. Spotlacing. Syrlig fruktaroma(?). Smaken sjokolade & lakris - men syrligheten slipper ikke helt taket.\n",
      "Dark brown and a dark brown head. It has bread, dark cherry, roast, vanilla, and cherry.\n",
      "An eminently drinkable beer with lots of Belgian yeast character. Spicy hops are well melded with mildly sweet malts. Light amber pour lacking much head. Nice spicy hop finish. Carbonation is in all the right places. Could easily substitute an American IPA in terms of food pairing. Good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "UTT is anything but subtle.  This heavy-handed Americanized version of the style ups the ante in every sense of the word. Tons of banana and yeast esters are where it starts. Sweety bready pale malt character starts to take over mid sip. It winds up with a vegetal smack of spicy hops and aggressive wash of carbonation, then a pretty hot alcohol finish. It's good, but is completely lacking in the subtlety of the original style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark brown with dark brown head. It is creamy with roast, chocolate, and slight nut.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Gyldenbrun. Filmskum. Spotlacing. Kjeksaroma. Smaken kjeks & aprikos. Tørr lett bitter avslutning.\n",
      "Deep amber with thick rocky off-white head. Oodles of lace. Lots of toffee and vanilla. Coffee peeks out from behind the malts. A bit of cellar must and lots of yeast. Quite hot. Aggressively hoppy fade followed by black coffee. It's ok. The flavors don't seem well melded to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Blueberry Cheese Danish beer. Delicious heaps of vanilla atop fresh blueberries. Cherries are in there, but play a bit part. This beer is all about pastry flavors and blueberry. Pours a cool deep violet, though missing much of a head. Only lightly tart. More on the sweet and fruity side. Excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incendiary hits it out of the park on this one. I love this beer. While it's not the prettiest (dull maize with zero head), this ugly duckling has a lot of great qualities. Classic coriander and wheat cracker nose dosed with an aggressive fresh lemon zest on top. The flavors really pop with a long wash at the end of each swallow intensely adding its character to the mix and lifting the bright lemon zest to the forefront. The absolute perfect summertime beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night Shift is a seriously weird beer. Points for uniqueness, though it doesn't completely work. The nose is old bong water filtered through charred chicory wood and evergreen needles. Intense oily Mosaic hops lend a bit of motor oil aroma, which is pushed down by the intense woodiness of the Midnight Wheat malt bill. It's a fun beer to power through, if not completely enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "On tap at Kokopelli poured a hazy reddish amber with a small lingering amber head. Aromas of caramel, wheat, earthiness, yeast, clove and a hint of fruitiness.

      "On tap at Kokopelli poured a hazy gold with a small lingering white head. Aromas of straw, fruitiness and a hint if yeast. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a smooth dry finish. Flavors of straw, yeast and light fruitiness with a smooth dry lightly bitter finish.\n",

      "Bomber poured a clear dark reddish brown with a small lingering brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, smoke, bakers cocoa, bacon and light oak. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of roasted malt, smoke, bakers cocoa, whiskey, light oak and a hint of fruitiness with a smooth dry lingering smokey finish.\n",
      "Süßlicher, fruchtig honigartiger Beginn. Wenig bis kein Alkohol, Saft, zum Ende etwas Honig. Unspannend. 8/7/6/6/7/7\n",
      "On cask at Bombay brew Rochdale. Think this will be on permanently here smooth a little oaty some spicy hop and citrus.\n",
      "Gravity dispense at the brewpub. Really nice balance of caramel malt and some earthy hops. Lovely.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Red Bank. Bright golden colour, short-lived white foam head and aroma of funk, apple, hint of rum. Taste is funky apple, solventy, drying, some tannins, and maybe a hint of rum, along with a slight woody oaky note. Medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, drying funky finish. Quite drinkable.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Red Bank. Golden colour, very fizzy short-lived white  foamy head and aroma of strawberry, jammy, sweets. Taste is sweet, strawberry flavour, bubblegum, citric, with apple and alittle underlying funk. Medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, medium-sweet and slightly astringent finish. OK.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Red Bank. Pale golden colour, short-lived fizzy white foam head and aroma of floral elderflower, alittle pear. Taste is sweetish, tangy, elderflower, citric, with some light pear notes. Light bodied, spritzy carbonation, medium-dry citric elderflower finish. Refreshing, quite OK\n",
      "Can at home from Elusive Brewery, 2nd February 2020.  Pours a light straw colour and light hazy.  Aroma is citrus and straw.  Taste is clean, bitter, citrus, straw, refreshing and loads of flavour for the ABV, excellent session\n",
      "500 ml bottle. Pours a mostly clear, somewhat hazy large white head. A interesting funky melon nose. Sweet at times, lemons, again a really surprisingly funky grapefruit flavor, sort of hay like, oranges. Pretty good.\n",
      "Bottle. Roasted malt aroma with notes of vanilla, lactose sugar, coffee and chocolate. Pours black with a large mocha brown head that has excellent retention and some lacing. Starts with roasted malt, chocolate and coffee flavors as well as having a full body and silky smooth mouthfeel. Finishes impeccably smooth with lactose sugar and vanilla flavors. Excellent milk stout!\n",
      "Crowler shared at Levi's tasting - thanks! Yeast and wheat, some light fruit that didn't really work in this.\n",
      "Crowler shared at Levi's tasting. Hoppy, bitter, herbal - this was okay, but I didn't love it.\n",
      "Tap at Grizzly's. Hazy yellow pour with a white head. Nice smell - tropical. Not a fan of the taste - too much plant character.\n",
      "Tap at Grizzly's. I'm sure I'm overrating this. I like a big stout, I like milk stouts, but this was too sweet, and a bit of sour creeping in that I doubt was intended. Kind of a mess.\n",
      "500-ml bottle from binnys Lincoln Park. good bubbly swiss cheese head, nutty malty sweet nose, creamy, roasty, in fact honey, nutty. rating #1!\n",

      "Tap at Grizzly's. Dark pour. Super sticky sweet - way too sweet, even for me, and that's saying something. Couldn't even finish half of a 4-oz pour.\n",
      "Tap at the taproom. Hazy yellow pour with a small white head. Awesome flavor explosion of key lime pie, nice spice note. Coats the tongue a bit and really holds the flavor on taste.\n",
      "Tap at the taproom. Hazy yellow pour with a white head. Hoppy, citrus, smooth, pineapple - super good.\n",
      "Pours a very black color.  One finger dark brown head.  Good retention and good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, marshmallow cream.  Hint of vanilla, cinnamon graham cracker. Taste is somewhat disappointing.  Smells great but I get a surge of alcohol.  After getting past that....it’s mostly graham cracker and maybe marshmallow...hard to tell. Mouthfeel is full bodied.  Dense, dark.  Sweet, heavy alcohol.  Oily.Overall, it’s potent.  Too much alcohol, it’s hard to get past that.  I probably wouldn’t recommend it and I probably wouldn’t buy it again.\n",
      "Tallboy can with. Tribute label for the Des Moines Buccaneers hockey team. This poured a dark gold with lots of fast moving bubbles. A thin white head is persistent. Nose of fresh grains. Dried flowers B's apple core is also in the smell. Lightly sweet this one has some bread crust and dried flowers in the taste. It reminds me of dandelion wine. Nicely done for the style with a smooth mouthfeel.\n",
      "It pours dark brown with a tan head. Upfront it is roasty and chocolaty. Then there is a strong flavor of macadamia nuts.\n",
      "Pours a somewhat hazy amber from a can. Tropical fruit aroma and flavor, citrus in there as well. Pretty good beer.\n",
      "Nice powerful aroma with bold hoppiness. Even flavor with a caramel sweetness. Dank with a medium weight.\n",
      "A dark golden color with a white head. The aroma contains some lemons and of course the chronic. The weed aroma seems to actually be lesser in this than other 420 strains. The flavor is slight malty with some grass and corn notes. Grass like lawn grass but also some herbal notes from the \"strain\" Overall not great but a little better than I expected it to be. Apparently B-Real these days is effing with the big 4-0.\n",
      "On tap at bier thirty pours out hazy golden topped with a white head. Nose is sweet tropical fruit hops citrus and some bread. Taste is more of the nice sweet tropical fruit hops and a good kick of hops.\n",
      "It pours black with a brown head. It has strong coffee with roast, vanilla, plums and cocoa.\n",
      "Draft at Batdorf. Pours orange with a thin white head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Lots of orange on the nose and tongue. Has a slight bitterness on the finish. Crushable.\n",
      "It is clear and golden with a small white head. It has cracker and honey flavors with herbs.\n",
      "An orange appearance with a white head. The aroma contains a huge smack of the Mary Jane along with some citrus oranges and lemons. The flavor is somewhat bitter and herbal. Lots of orange and \"grassy\" notes. Some resin is present. The aftertaste is very herbal. Overall this may not be everyone's \"bag\" but it is pretty tasty and different to say the least.\n",
      "12 oz can from a six pack. No mention of \"No. 15\" on the label. Aroma is bready, floral, citrus, peppery, generic beer--altogether pretty faint compared to most entries in this series, or just quality modern IPAs in general. Pours clear light golden with a one finger bone-white head with good retention. Taste is moderately to highly bitter with a faint candy sweetness, finishing very dry. Flavors of grapefruit pith, bready malt. Perfect mouthfeel. Not very aromatic, but it's a nicely flavored bitter west coast style IPA.\n",

      "It pours black with low head It has oats and a nutty flavor with raisons. Alcohol is noticeable with bourbon.\n",
      "Murky orange with an off white head. It has strong citrus and grapefruit. There is low dankness to it.\n",
      "Pours black with two finger, tan head.  Aroma is cocoa, roast and light molasses.  Taste is brown sugar, light chocolate and lactose, moving to roast.  Finish is chocolate milk and roast.  Good milk stout - well put together.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from the brewery. Pours a deep, dark, cloudy brown with a moderate beige head that settles into an uneven ring and island of film. Notes of peanut butter and neapolitan-style sweet strawberry, first and foremost, with some fudge, earth, and roasted malts. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, malty, tangy mouthfeel. The fruited variants tend to be the weaker ones, and this is no exception.\n",
      "Golden colour. Bright honeyish, tropical aroma. Very light body, not much bitterness, but it has a good weedy note and dry finish. Almost drinks too easy.\n",
      "It pours straw with a white head. It is bready and a bit spicy with a little bit of biscuit.\n",
      "Draft at Batdorf. Pours black with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Has a mix of strawberry and roasted malt which doesn’t work at all. Strawberries should probably be consigned to Panera salads and Pocono date nights. It does hide its booze well.\n",
      "Draft at Rotunda. Pours Coca-Cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Lots of chocolate on the nose and tongue. Hides it’s booze well. Finished clean.\n",
      "Bottle shared by Kyle, thanks! Pours a clear amber brown with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has booze and grains with a touch of plum underlying. Flavor has barrel and earthy grain with booze and plum backing.\n",
      "A pleasurable light beer.  A very, very, very light beer at 3.2 ABV. This beer doesn’t compare to more traditional session IPA’s. It does not have much hops or bitterness—8 IBUs. But it does have a nice flavor that is much better than any mass produced light lagers. \n",
      "\n",
      "After drinking this I propose (tongue in cheek) a new beer style. Let’s call it an imperial non-alcohol pale ale.\n",

      "Can, thanks to Ben. Pours deep red purple. Boysenberry, cherry, blueberry, light tartness, little salty doughiness. Medium body. Very tasty.\n",
      "draft at the Brewery in Waynesboro, VA  The ale poured a cloudy light amber color with a white head and lacing. The ale has a light body with soft carbonation.  It is an easy to drink IPA with mild hop bitterness.\n",
      "Draft at Batdorf. Pours yellow and super hazy with a white head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Fairly solid tropical citrus on the nose and tongue with a bit more bitterness on the finish than you typically see.\n",
      "12 oz. can from Keith. Pours a mostly clear gold with a moderate white head that settles into a ring and island of film. The malt profile here is light but sweeter and more corny than expected. Light grassy, citrusy, and floral hops. There's a mineral kind of dryness, too. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a dry, clean, lightly bitter mouthfeel. Doesn't stand up to Two Hearted but I guess that's the point.\n",

      "Very pleasant, smooth, not so much lactose detected in a negative light.  Good fruit.  Moderately sour.\n",
      "Heavy notes of grapefruit zest, mango, lime, pineapple, and berry, with a resinous undertone and a clingy mineral bitterness on the fade. Vegetal undercurrent pops up in the finish, not quite gelling with the citrus salad front. Growing hop burn makes finishing the pint difficult. Not bad, but very raw and the astringency kinda kills any interest after half a can. BI usually does much better.\n",
      "$3.80 pint can, WW. Murky gold with a sewer-froth-like head that quickly disappears. Tropical fruit mix, orange, grain nose. Flavor is grain, white rice, orange peel, grapefruit rind, lemon zest, envelope glue. Carbonation is lacking and the long, lingering envelope glue/rice flavor is a bit off-putting. Overall a bit of a mess.\n",
      "Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that lasted with very good lacing. Moderate to heavy complex toasted malt aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy boozy sweet flavor with a moderate to heavy sweet finish of medium to long duration. This beer met my expectations.\n",
      "Pours clear, dark mahogany with two finger, light tan head.  Aroma is strong roast, light caramel and some cocoa.  Taste is chocolate and light caramel, moving to roast and coffee.  Finish is roast, caramel and coffee.  Good porter.\n",
      "2 week old can\n",
      "A: Crystal clear pale amber pour with 1/4\" head that held for a couple minutes before falling to a lasting ring.\n",
      "S: Muted sweet citrus with a little sweet toasted bread or cracker.\n",
      "T: Bitter citrus pith hits first and fades to a clean but empty aftertaste with maybe a faint hint of toast. At least it doesn't taste like seltzer.\n",
      "M: Very spritely carbonation and ultra light body. Clean and dry.\n",
      "O: Unimpressive. If Bell's can't do this well who can? Oh yeah, Uinta.\n",
      "Draft. Poured clear copper color with an average frothy white head that lasted with very good lacing. Moderate hop forward balanced aroma.  Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate bittersweet flavor with a moderate bittersweet finish of medium duration. This beer met my low expectations.\n",
      "Thanks to AleRider78 for this one from the brewery. Can that pours a slight hazed, light golden colour with a big frothy white cap, good retention and lots of foamy-soapy lacing. Grassy hop nose with some pineapple notes. The mouthfeel is light, with a touch of tart and dryness. The flavours are milder with some grassiness, hoppiness and citrus. A well-brewed Session IPA which is not the most potent, but does the job.\n",
      "Bottle. Pours opaque jet black with a small, frothy beige head, short retention. Medium oak, moderate chocolate and roast malt, dark fruits, coffee, and a medium sweet finish. Full body and medium carbonation\n",
      "Bottle shared by Kyle, thanks! Pours a clear has barrel, dark grains and cherry with a touch of roast supporting. Flavor has sweet dark grains and cherry with a bit of roast and oak backing.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear brown with a medium, frothy white head, short retention leaving a cordon. Medium earthy and spicy coffee, tart acidic plums, medium bread malt and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Can. Pours a clear deep gold with no head whatsoever. Aroma has sweet honey with light oak and a touch of wood. Flavor has sweet honey with a touch of flora and some oak in the finish.\n",
      "Can shared by Yaniv, thanks! Pours a hazy yellow with a hint of orange and a white head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has light sweet papaya and mango with a bit of guava and sweet citrus underlying. Flavor has sweet citrus and light mango with some papaya backing.\n",
      "Sampled from the Crowler. Pours a clear pale straw yellow with a white head that dissipates quickly and nearly completely. Aroma has sweet mango and earthy wheat with some Belgian yeast. Flavor has Belgian yeast and mango with sweet wheat backing.\n",

      "Sampled from the tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy yellow orange with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has guava and papaya with sweet onion and sweet grains supporting. Flavor has earthy tropical fruits, dry citrus and a touch of sweet onion.\n",
      "Hazy.. sweet, light hops and far too8ch lactose flavor in my opinion. This is ok.\n",
      "Cask at Moor Vaults, Bermondsey, 31/01/20.\n",
      "Mahogany brown with a decent beige cap that thins edgeward.\n",
      "Nose is a touch thin but not offensive comprising dried fruits, toffee, dark malts.\n",
      "Taste comprises toffee, brown sugar dusting, nutty, fruit slice, brown bread.\n",
      "Medium bodied, soft carbonation, semi drying close.\n",
      "Not bad.\n",
      "Pours a clear golden with a full white head.  Cherry, wheat, and grain constitute a slightly tart yet rather weak aroma.  The advertised cherry comes through in the taste, although it isn't overpowering.  Besides this, you will find bread, wheat, and apple, but the overall flavor palate is a little underwhelming.  That being said, this is refreshing to drink.  Sweet, mildly tart, and with a lingering cherry finish.  Light in body.  As a session sour, this one does the trick.  Just don't expect to be overawed.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours gold. Guava, pineapple, tart, tropical, clean finish. Medium body. Good.\n",
      "Draught. Pours cloudy orange with a small, frothy white head, short retention. Medium tart and acidic apricots, light bread malt, and a dry finish. Light body and carbonation.\n",
      "Dark brown body with white head.  Malty aroma.  Sweet malt taste with a tangy edge.  Malty finish\n",
      "Clear yellow body with white head.  Light hop aroma.  Orange in taste all of it rather light.  Thin finish.  Their regular pilsner is better.  Brewed with Baerlic Brewing.\n",
      "Some tropical citrus hop aromas and flavors with a full flavored, slightly sweet malt base. Really delicious and flavorful for a 5%abv beer. Juicy hoppy but balanced against the sweeter malt base. Not bitter but has some bitter to balance. This is an impressive easy drinking ipa with tons of flavor. I like it.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Heavy pine, orange, and floral hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",

      "On tap at the brewery. Pours orange red. Bubblegum, cranberry, red, esters. Medium body. Fine.\n",
      "Pours clear orange with a medium off-white head and good lacing. Aroma is bracing pine and aspirin. Flavor is light plus sweet, full bitter, harsh. Lingering aspirin and aspartame aftertaste. Medium Body. Acclimator on steroids, not in a good way.\n",
      "Tap. Pours hazy deep mahogany, medium beige head, decent lacing. Aroma is charred wood, hints of burnt rubber, roast. Flavor is light plus sweet, light bitter, kind of a homebew feel to it. Medium body. Acrid.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours black. Chocolate, vanilla, rum, spiced rum, sweet creaminess, boozy rum chocolate. Thick soft body. Very good.\n",

      "Sourced at the Kernel Taproom - Bermondsey. Pours black-brown with a foamy, beige head. In a word, stupendous. Great balance, some rich dark chocolate, ample roast, earth, some orange citrus notes. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Finishes with further sturdy roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, well toasted pine. Outstanding.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with a small, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate rich chocolate malt, light oyster character, light mineral notes, dark fruits, and a dry finish. Full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Sourced at the Kernel Taproom - Bermondsey. Pours lightly hazy gold with a frothy, pure white head. Has only light sweetness, pithy citrus fruits, lemon rind, subtle minerality. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Dry and pithy in the finish, more lemon rind, nips of grapefruit. Easy drinker.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours clear gold. Biscuit, lemon, apricot, floral. Medium body. Clean and well made.\n",
      "Tap at the taproom. Dark pour with a spotty clingy head. Vanilla, hint of roast, thick and rich.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear ruby with a medium, frothy pink head, medium retention with light lacing. Moderate raspberry, light tartness, light malt and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Can from Holiday Market. Pours a clear straw gold with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Light coconut aromas with strong tea leaf notes and paper. Lowish carbonation....almost flat to be honest. Cardboard and more tea leaf flavors. Quick finish with tea astringency.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Heavy pine, floral, and fruity hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bread malt, light alcohol, and a medium dry finish. Full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Tap at the taproom. Reddish orange pour with a creamy head. Carmel, dark fruit, spice.\n",

      "1/2/2020. Cask at the Dove, Ipswich. Says series 3 on the pump clip but couldn’t get to it to take a photo. Pours clear pale gold with a short lasting white head. Aroma of hops, citrus, grass, grapefruit, flowers and a touch of ripe banana. Moderate sweetness and medium plus hoppy citrus bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily and watery texture, soft carbonation. Nice bitterness to finish.\n",
      "16 oz can from Tavour, 2/1/20.  The pour is dark brown-black, thin head, light / spotty lace.  Sweet, chocolatey aroma with some berry fruitiness.  Taste is similar, but I get more if that classic almond paste taste that you get from the namesake cookie.  The almond flavor is a little too subtle in comparison to the other components to truly give a rainbow cookie experience, but it's on the right track. Still, a pretty good sweet stout, and one that hides the ABV fairly expertly.  \n",
      "7/3/8/4/15\n",
      "Keg at Dairyland, 2.1.20. Hazy orange thin head. Aroma of wheat, citrus. Taste is wheat, citrus, and an agave like note. Thin. Not the best hefe but that's probably because it's for the Dairyland audience.\n",
      "Looks like brown water, spices are vague at best on the nose and reminiscent of an old man's watery soap. Flavour is watery molasses and diluted brown sugar - where are the spices? Ichh, a watery mess at best. At least you can't detect the alcohol.\n",
      "Draught. Pours lightly hazy yellow with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with light lacing. Medium white grapes, medium bread malt, light earthy character, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a large, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Medium grainy and husky malt, light earthy spices, light earthy hops and hop bitterness, medium funky Brettanomyces and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.\n",

      "Poured too high so it looks like dark water with a titch of foam, smells well of dark cookies and sweet chocolate biscuit all over the place. Flavour is lots of biscuity cookies, chewy sweetness in all the right amounts. Full and dry finish thanks to the heavy cookie presence. Enjoyable in many ways.\n",
      "Draft imperial pint enjoyed at Special Brews.  Now, I have semi retired from rating on a regular basis, but dammit I feel like I owe it to these guys to continue bragging on here about how awesome they are, and how I am spoiled that I get to enjoy new amazing brews from them on a weekly basis.  Hundreds over the years, and they never let me down.  Even the saison series that mysteriously disappeared, I'd be down to drink a few pints of.  Juicy golden appearance, moderate to heavy haze.  This fizz head, sticky lacing.  Blah Blah Blah.  Who cares about all that.  It's juicy and delicious.  Melon like hop refresher.  Soft lingering pine too.  This doesn't scream the hazy characteristics I've grown sick of.  This just sticks to being a badass pale ale for the guy that just wants a GD beer.  Yes sir.\n",
      "Good deep copper body and modest foam, caramel and sweet hops on the nose. Flavour is floral hops and rancid honey with some brown sugar hints. Full on the mouth like cotton balls. A miss in many ways.\n",
      "kupljenu u marketu konzum u Livnu ...zanimljiv izbor voca za izradu radlera ... moram priznati da je ovo zanimljivo pivo (sok) dok je ledeno ..okus je skroz dobar ali samo dok je ledeno ..cim se malo ugrije pivo okus je los ...\n",

      "On tap at the brewery. Pours gold yellow. Banana, bubblegum, little grape, tangerine. Good body. Refreshing.\n",
      "Can from Hoptimism. Lightly hazed golden beer with a white head. Aroma orange citrus, light spice. Taste bittersweet to sweet. Full smooth and creamy body. Not overly boozy.\n",
      "Pour is a clear golden with a large white head.  Aroma is a light blueberry with some peach.  Flavor is some grain with a real soft mouth feel.  Some hops on the swallow with a very minor bitterness.  It does not say what hops were used but if I had to guess it would be mosaic. Decent beer and one where the aroma was better than the flavor.\n",
      "Draft pour with a deep coffee brown color. Sweet Buttery aroma. Flavors of honey, toffee, butter and chocolate. Basically a Heath bar.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours murky brown. Vanilla, juniper, earthy, oak, white chocolate, spice, tangerine. Medium body. Odd.\n",

      "On tap at the brewery. Pours gold. Banana, spice, honey, sweet, estery. Medium body. Medium body. Nice.\n",
      "Tap at University of Beer in Fairfield, CA. Pours hazy amber/gold with a white head. Aroma of citrus and pale stone fruit. Medium plus body. It’s not dry, but it’s fairly bitter. Flavor is sort of thick/puree pale prunus fruit; Peach, plum and apricot.\n",
      "Draft pour with a cloudy honey color. Aroma of nutmeg. This rating is not a good one because the glass tastes of cleaner, that said I am not sure it would make a huge difference. The flavors are closer to pumpkin pie with the nutmeg leading it.\n",
      "Mellow grape must on the nose, nice foam on a lighter clear copper body. Flavour is messy hay, hop sweetness, light grain. Still full and refreshing though, and quite nice.\n",

      "Can. Turner’s, Sheffield. Medium haze on a medium gold. Fine, messy, lacing, viscous, white head. Nose errs toward the dank and sticky. Nose has sappy pine, and rich, ripe, mouldy citrus. Touch of mint and oily herb. Some sweaty, bready yeast. Taste has a ripe citrus sweetness, but really it’s a bitter bomb. Rich and fairly smooth on the palate. A bit sticky. Fine carbonation. Lingering bitterness to finish. Decent gear.\n",
      "Draft pour with a hazy light gold color. Juicy but balanced with the vanilla and the oat milk makes this very smooth. Flavors of guava, vanilla and pine.\n",
      "Good solid foam on a semi cloudy brown body, nice hop and malt aroma. Flavour is nicely balanced hop and malt, mouthfeel is crisp and oily. Nothing unique here but it's a very well made pale ale.\n",
      "This is different. Draft pour light pink color. Chalky tart medicinal aroma. Dry and tart up front. Floral and fruit notes of berry and honey. There is a chalky medicinal taste from the tea almost like Tums.\n",
      "Pours a pinkish-orange, with minimal head. Aromas of raspberry, vanilla, some citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is lightly sweet, with raspberry, vanilla, citrus, tropical fruit. Just a touch of sour, with a bit of hop bitterness at the finish. Smooth, soft mouthfeel.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Gyldengul. Uklar. Skumring. Lett plommearoma. Smaken tørkete bær. Tørr, lett bitter avslutning.\n",
      "Draft at the Butterfield Taproom in Wheaton, IL. for their Solemn Oath Tap Takeover, dispensed to a pint glass displaying a darkest brown hue, with amber highlighting, a silky layer of tan froth, and wavy cling to the lacing. The nose was dark malts, mocha notes, malty creaminess, with nutty/woody hints. Medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, the taste was similar notes, finishing with mild, roasted bitterness, and a bit of dryness. A solid example of a Black Lager.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Total Wine in Lexington. A fairly orange pour. Taste is somewhat bready with some hops. Not too much of the light IPA I expected or wanted.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Gylden. Fjærlett bæraroma. Smaken søt frukt. Søt, litt tung avslutning.\n",
      "Draft pour with a deep amber color. Light molasses and brown sugar aroma. Dry, notes of brown bread but there is an off taste in this.\n",
      "On tap, Blackberry Farm Taproom, Maryville.  Very dark pour, not quite opaque.  Sticky Khaki head. Wonderful aroma, rich and complex. Coffee and honey tang, nice roast, fairly acidic.  This started out well, there were a couple of flaws in the finish.  Still excellent.\n",
      "Bottle, clear pale straw yellow, strong carbonation, aroma of ripe apples and yeast, flavor of ripe apples, roots and herbs with some alcohol showing. Nice but a little too boozy.\n",
      "Draft pour with a clear light straw color. Light pine and grass aroma. Very little bodied, bitter but not over bearing. Notes of pine resin, grassy, chlorophyll and notes of alcohol vapors.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Red Bank. Golden colour, short-lived fizzy white foam head and aroma of butterscotch, pear & hints of sulphur. Taste is sweet, pear, fruity, sugary, with toffee, butterscotch & caramel notes. Syrupy mouthfeel, medium bodied, low carbonation, sweet finish. Quite OK, abit sweet.\n",

      "2020-01-24. Black body, quick head. Aroma of dry roast malt and cocoa undertones. Flavour is lightly lactic and sour. Light dry roast undertones Average bodied palate, moderate carbonation feels thinner than it wants to be. Okay.  7/3/6/3/13 On tap at Bandit, Toronto.\n",

      "2020-01-24. Black body, modest brown head. Aroma of dry coffee and roast malt. Subtle chocolate undertones. Flavour is quite coffee forward with a lot of bitter roast. Nice chocolate undertones throughout come out more in the finish and aftertaste. Smooth average plus to medium bodied palate, moderate carbonation. 3++ If the proportions of coffee and chocolate were reversed I would love it. Not really to my own tastes with such prominent coffee. 7/3-4/6-7/4/14-15 On tap at Bandit, Toronto.\n",

      "1st January 2020Can. Hazy gold beer, small pale cream colour head. Smooth palate, semi dry, decent fine carbonation. Smooth malts, a light creamy sweetness. But also has an unwelcome smoky note. Smooth piney semi ripe orange and tangerine. Trace of grapefruit. Light finish. Don't hate this but it's a bit flaccid and feck off with the smoked malts.\n",

      "On tap at The Magnet, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Nose brings out wild yeast, with light rose hops, and champagne-like effervescence. Flavour is full of champagne-like effervescence, spicy apple skins, and wild yeast. Complex and well-balanced, with a spritzy finish. Very good.\n",

      "First rating of the beer!  Can from the brewery.  Hazy honeycomb yellow with moderate white head that dissipates quickly.  Bright citrus and wheat based aroma.  Flavor is massive orange. Slight bittering.  Seems like a hazy although not advertised that way.  Wonderfully robust flavor.\n",
      "16 ounce can. Number one with a bullet. Bright medium gold pour. Frothy beige head has rocky peaks and leaves a nice clinging lace. Slightly sour, perfumy malt aroma. The sea buckthorn gives off a sweet berry-like note. First sip is sour fruit. Sour orange and funky yeast. Perhaps unripe pineapple is more apt a description. As sours go, this is an easy going, accessible example. Just right. Not too tart, not too sweet. Relax and enjoy the bounty that is Lagom.\n",

      "4 ounce draft. Crystal clear gold in color. For what it is, it is totally fine. Mild Mango, subtle lactic acid, sour wheat. Mild sourness lasting in the finish. Very approachable kettle sour.\n",
      "4 oz draft and 16 oz. can. Some New England IPA is say they have guava notes. This actually taste like water. A lot of melon notes too. I like the guava and mild melon sweet notes. Also still shows the bitterness in the finish to balance. These experimental hops work really well together.\n",
      "From the long can at Baba day.  Mostly like the others in taste and pour but a bit of the coffee added.\n",
      "On tap at Bittercreek, Boise Milkshake cloudy light orange pour.  Thin lasting clinging white head.  Very fresh citrus and soft pillowy tropical fruit aromas and flavors.  Orange and grapefruit, and very soft.  Delicious\n",

      "4 oz draft. Darker brown color. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly fruity, with some caramel and toffee malt. The finish is mild to moderately yeasty. Nice presentation of the yeast.\n",
      "Tap at Pangaea. Pours bright gold with a creamy white head. Citrus pine aroma. Medium body. Somewhat creamy. Not very dry. But nicely bitter. Mellow old school with a touch of West Coast. Tastes good.\n",
      "On tap at the Nampa brewery/taproom  Pours a clear deep orange amber.  Thin white head and spotty lacing.  Soft light toast malts with a little light brown sugar in the aromas.  Flavors are light sweet pale malts, modest Belgian yeast character.  A little soapy in the hop flavors. Clean  finish.  Fairly dry for a tripel.\n",

      "16 ounce can shared at Baba day. A normal looking HH beer but with sweet marshmallow taste with mango\n",
      "Cask at The Pennsylvanian (JDW), Rickmansworth on 24/10/2007.  You might have thought that some time without seeing a Rebellion beer might have endeared me to them slightly more.  Nope; just another perfectly drinkable and totally unremarkable bitter.\n",

      "On tap at The Beer Cellar in Glen Ellyn, IL. for their Life After Deth gathering, dispensed to plastic as a 7 oz. serving showing a black/brown hue, with a decent layer of brownish tan froth, and wavy cling to the foamy lacing. The nose was highly roasted, cocoa, some woodiness & earthiness, dark fruit, caramel & toffee sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Nearly full bodied, with fair to low carbonation, the taste was similar, with syrupy & sticky texture, some tartness & tanginess, bourbon warmth, and appropriate roasted & earthy bitterness.\n",

Light cherry juice on the nose, taste is fairly rich, certainly doesn't bely its 10% strength, excellent brandy integration, nice nutty vanilla murmurs on the close, alongside Hogan's recognisable, if soft tannic acidity, gentle cherry notes weaving about. Very enjoyable, more of this sort of thing please.\n",
      "Cask @ Fox & Goose, Hebden Bridge.  Golden hoppy brew with some strength evident giving it a fuller taste.  Has a drier hoppy nose.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Beer District, Buxton. Pours a deep unclear amber. Aroma is wild, funky with acetic hints. Taste continues, underlying acetic vinegar remains underlying, good natural fruit sweetness, funk hints, some wood. Overall, an enjoyable, characterful naturally fruity cider with a gentle sparkle.\n",

      "Keg at Hop Locker 1. Tangy stone fruit aroma. Hazy bright gold. Thick creamy white head. Medium bitter. Some stone fruit sourness - a prickle. Light bodied. Thin but slick. There's a fizzy carbonation that is the prominent sensation when it comes to this beer. Very dry finish. Enjoyable if ethereal.\n",
      "Keg at CBC Covent Garden. Astringent/fruit vinegar aroma. Inhale it. Murky darkish brown. The beige head just rings the rim (or whatever). Very sour. That remains throughout and is almost overpowering. However there is life underneath the sourness... a nutty fudgy nougat coffee slab is in there. The miasma cannot hide it entirely as tendrils reach for the surface. Light bodied. Thin but slick. Flat. Uber face smashingly (clearly I exaggerate) astringent finish. I like. But recently I've been getting into melodic and depressive black metal so I may be having a breakdown.\n",
      "Taste: big complex spiced hops, grapefruit, peppery, citrus notes. Tropical fruit hoppy nose. Bright amber hue, nice lacy head. Medium body. Malt balanced out some of the hop bitterness.\n",
      "Can, from Trader Joe's. Pours extremely hazy dark yellow-orange with foamy light beige head, orange peel aroma, low carbonation, medium bitter lightly resinous orange peel-apricot taste, somewhat thick body, long finish. Smooth and easy to drink.\n",

Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate sweet flavor with a moderate sweet finish of medium duration. This crushable beer met my expectations.\n",
      "From a bottle shared at Baba day. A fairly sweet pour with fruit tartness and a weird berry finish. Not sure.\n",
      "Bottle, at a tasting. Clear pale yellow, lots of bubbles. Aroma of wood, herbs, apples skin. Sweet with apples, vanilla, suplhuric, tart, alcoholic. Medium-bodied, lively carbonation.\n",
      "Draught @ Dive 106 (1/28/20). Pours cloudy lemon yellow with small foamy off-white head, lemon peel-pineapple aroma, medium carbonation, medium bitter lemon peel pineapple taste faint mango flavors, thin body, long medium bitter finish. Decent NEIPA.\n",
      "750-ml bottle from rare beer club. good sparkly-bubbled head, spots of lace, opaque cola color with reddish highlights, surprisingly fruity nose, creamy, barley wine + fruity sweetness, herbal bitterness, malty, booze in background, complex, melded great. cork flew 226 in. rating #1!\n",
      "Gift from a friend who picked it up on location, I couldn’t refuse a NEIPA. Worth the try.\n",

      "32oz crowler from Arlington Brew Shop, pours a pulpy gold, plenty of frothy, white head.  Nose is interesting, peach sorbet, melon, orange, clear grist, maybe even treacle, pineapple.  Flavor has the pineapple and peach but its almost popsicle like without being sweet, there is sweetness reading more like grist now, heavy dandelion too.  Finishes off dry, medium bodied.  In a flight of IPAs, this might get lost.  7 4 8 3 13\n",
      "16oz can pours a pulpy orange, sudsy white head.  Nose has tangerine, melon, guava, grapefruit, green vanilla, grass.  Flavor is mostly citrus and grass.  There's a big grapefruit/fresh orange character that over powers any ripe fruit.  Not a complaint.  Full bodied, bitter finish.  8 3 8 4 14\n",
      "Tap at Kultainen Apina. Pours hazy yellow with white head. Aroma and taste have juicy tropical fruits, pineapple, tangerine, mango, juicy hops, faint hop burn. Medium to full body, oily texture, soft carbonation, bitter finish.\n",
      "Purchased online and labelled as “German IPA”. \n",
      "It has a nice colour and smell, but taste is very limited. It doesn’t have the bitterness of an IPA and lacks of hoppy aroma. Very watery. It tastes more like. Baby between a franciskaner and a sweet IPA. Not really worth it.\n",
      "Cask at The Grainstore Brewery, Oakham on 20/08/2007.  Actually quite a hoppy bite to this beer.  Fairly crisp and a little fruity.\n",
      "16 ounce can. Pours a hazy orange hue with a large white head. A big funky lemon nose. More sort of funky flavors, tropical, almost tart lemons, fluffy big palate. Nice. Sort of green, raw. Solid.\n",
      "16 ounce can. Pours a clear orange hue with a medium white head. A nice big fruity orange and toast nose. Very flavorful: big oranges, toast, light lemon bitterness. Very smooth.\n",
      "Aromas: Tons of wood, corkscrew, sawdust, tequila, molasses, brown sugar, oak, agave syrup, port wine, caramel, nougat and biscotti. Taste is just like the old agave maria with more intense barrel, wood, sawdust, planks, oak, tequila, syrup, agave, cactus juice, brown sugar, port wine, sherry, dessert wine, toffee, burnt caramel, harsh wort syrup, aged malts and biscotti. Overall, Incredible. Love it.\n",
      "Aroma is apricot/watermelon and fruit/floral hops.  The flavor is watermelon, malts, apricot/fruit and a slightly sweet/hoppy finish.\n",
      "On tap at Steamworks, pours a cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of wild yeast, rustic saison yeast, and a hint of estery character. Flavour is quite complex, with a nice mix of rustic saison yeast and wild yeast, gentle estery notes and a hint of champagne-like effervescence. Complex and well-designed. Excellent.\n",
      "On cask at Steamworks, pours a deep dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma is pretty muffled, with earthy notes and nary a trace of coconut. Flavour reveals the coconut more prominently, but is also quite muffled and earthy. Not so well dialled in. Alright.\n",
      "On tap at Steamworks, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of bright guava, gentle lime, and a bit of wildness. Flavour is unusual for a radler, being nearly bone dry, with plenty of guava and lime, and a touch of funk. Refreshing and clean, but not particularly interesting.\n",

      "Growler from the brewery.  Slightly hazy yellow-tan body.  At 6.5% it sort has more in common with a Pale Lager.  Pleasant, clean, fresh, drinkable. Bready, straightforward.  Good.\n",

      "Hazy straw body. Aroma is mild dry grains. Taste is mild bitterness, ripe grapefruit. Texture is softer. A nice, easier IPA.\n",
      "16 oz can poured, picked up at Hop and Hound, and brought up here by the brewers themselves apparently.  Awesome!  Welcome to Seattle!  A delicious brew like this will do well here.  Tried side by side with their pilsner.  Also wonderful.  A mostly clean golden orange pour, far from my hazy expectations, but I dont have a scale, nor a care in the world about that.  Really juicy profile.  Smooth tropical tones.  Bright citrus combo.  Flavorful, and fruity without the sweetness overhaul.  Really nice IPA\n",

      "Can from the brewery, 1/30/19.  Canned 1/27/20, pretty damn fresh!  Pours a fully hazed golden color with a thin head and streaky lacing.  Nice juiciness here, with some lighter bitterness to keep it in balance.  Flavors come through as melon, tangerine, and peach.  Bit of strawberry as well.  Really nice mix here.  Clean and soft, sweet but balanced.  Really good.  Personally, I'd put this in the HOF way before it 117-117 namesake, but that's just me.  \n",

      "Draft at the source from notes around Christmas 2019. Pours a dark cola brown color with a small beige head that settles into a thin ring. The aroma has big port barrel and dark fruit character. The flavor has mild roasted malts, chocolate, and more big dark red fruit and port barrel character, vinous, mild oak, good flavor but it is a bit undercarbonated, it would be interesting to see what this could be with carbonation.\n",
      "On tap at Celis Austin. Pours copper. Aroma is hazelnuts, toast, caramel. Drier than the wiesn, more bitter, grainy. Dry malty finish. A good one but I preferred the Wiesn just slightly more.\n",

      "Pours a funny golden brown colour with a definitive look of coffee. Smells and tastes like what you would expect from a double double. A lot of creaminess in the palate and somewhat too much sweetness for me. The coffee and cream work well though, weird beer, achieves its goal.\n",
      "Taster. Poured hazy pale color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate floral balanced aroma.  Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate sweet flavor with a moderate sweet finish of medium duration. This beer met my expectations.\n",
      "Draft. Poured cloudy golden color with an average frothy white head that lasted with very good lacing. Moderate to heavy citrus hop aroma.  Medium to abundant body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy juicy bittersweet flavor with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. This beer met my expectations.\n",

      "A robust DIPA with plenty of fruit, but enough malt for balance. Quite enjoyable.\n",
      "Draft at the brewery. Dark, clear brown, filmy head. Malty, smoky aroma. Smoke kicks it up a notch (BAM!), providing campfire, ashy notes on top of a pure malt backbone.\n",
      "Lightly hazy bright gold with a rocky sticky white head. Nice bright and pale aroma featuring juicy pineapple and dank floral hoppy aromas. Crisp flavor that’s pale and lightly wheaty with light hoppy earthy resins with light bits of tropical pale fruit and a kiss of pineapple. Sorta semidry and middle of the road, medium bodied and just okay.\n",
      "Manchester Beer Festival 2020.  Extremely dark in colour with a dense toffee flavouring.\n",
      "Hazy NEIPA. This one is well done.  Super juicy nose with tons of citrus and crackery malt backbone. Pineapple,  grapefruit,  orange,  and lemon all play bit parts.  Support hippy,  but very low bitterness. Rather creamy as well. No rindiness. Well done.\n",
      "Can from Holiday Market. Pours a clearish, pale straw color with a quickly dissipating finger of white foam. Lemon, peach pit and white wine vinegar notes on the nose. Apple and peach pit on the palate with the pits really coming through giving a nice dry, tart peach flesh to complement the apple flavors. Dry finish.\n",
      "Adam lays down a skillful light American lager that can bridge the gap for non-craft beer drinkers. For those that are used to craft, its still a fine choice on the lighter side. Lawnmower is a pretty golden pour, crystal clear, with a resilient small ring of pure white head. Its really nice to look at.  Mild honey and delicate hop florals play well together. Its clean, light bodied, and crisp. It's also better than 90% of the beers in this style. Well done.\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Dark brown, filmy head. Rich, roasty aroma. Taste brings more roasty malts, hint of chocolate, burst of sweetness. Full, roasty, smooth.\n",
      "Pours pure black with a very dark brown head. Smells very roasted, a bit of sweetness. Tastes liek a whiskey stout with a full body and flavour. A slight sweetness and a bit of an alcohol burn. fairly smooth and with a long aftertaste. A very rich beer, yum!\n",
      "Taste: sweet, toffee, dark malts, bready, chocolate dark raisins, smokey, smooth finish. Same with the nose. Black reddish hue, semi clear, with tan head and nice lace. Full but not heavy body. Alcohol sneaks up on you.\n",
      "Can from Holiday Market. Pours a clear gold with a full two fingers of off-white foam. Notes of grapefruit, pine and light straw-like pilsner malt aromas. Super light on the palate with good carbonation, but not much flavor to be honest. Light pine bitterness on the finish. Great as a low cal beer, but just not much flavor unfortunately.\n",
      "Aroma of grass and herbs. Flavor has very light tropical fruit, mild grass, and a soft malt back bone. Texture is crisp and ends just slightly bitter. Overall, pretty refreshing.\n",

      "Taster at brewery. Pours out as expected. Full tropical, floral nose. Taste brings juicy citrus, more tropical notes. Floral hoppy thing going on, hibiscus\n",
      "500 mL bottle.  Bottle starts to foam as soon as I open it.  Pours hazy orange, but not terrifically foamy.  Smells of lemon acidity, strong grassy hops, some garlic hops, and brett.  Tastes of lime tartness up front, some doughy pale malt, sour citrus, and earthy brett notes.  Oak is light for Odd Breed, but the finish has a lingering woody flavor.  Surprisingly soft carbonation, considering the foamy bottle.  Chewy body.  I was hoping for something less sour when I read about this.  It's good, but the tartness seems to be the dominant flavor.  It doesn't let the malt profile or hops come through quite as much.\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Clear, bright golden, small bubbly head. Malty bready aroma. Taste is full, malty, spicy. Nice hoppy snap.\n",
      "16 oz can from the brewery, 1/30/20.  Canned 1/27/20, so pretty damn fresh!    The pour is unclear, golden-orange, with a white head that leaves some moderate, drippy streaks of lacing on the glass.  Bright, slightly tart pineapple, some mango and apricot as well.  Quite tropical.  Juicy, but not overly sweet.  Has a tang and a spice to the finish.  Quite good, and shines even more as I get toward the end of the can.  Seems as though I am pretty much the only person left on this site enjoying beers from this brewery, but judging by the crowds the rest of the NJ beer crowd likes them as much as I do.  Looking forward to enjoying and /or sharing with others the rest of my cans from this release.\n",
      "8/4/9/4/17\n",
      "Very beautiful ruby red pour with a fast dissipating white head and lively carbonation, hazy. Smells very sour and sharp, almost stings the nose, lots of cherry and yes can smell the note of raspberry too. Oh my god that's a nice one, big sour punch, really prickles the tongue, but not too sharp, lingers for a bit then rolls off, great carbonation and a slightly drying mouthfeel. Very light body, crisp and mouthwatering. Kudos to Burdock for hitting it out of the park.\n",
      "Pours a hazy, dijon mustard color, with mid-sized, but fast-dissipating head. Aroma is pungent, with some tropical fruit and citrus elements. Flavor follows, along with just a touch of alcohol burn. It's pretty sweet, followed by a fairly bitter, hoppy finish.\n",
      "Draft at the brewpub.  Clear and golden, quite still, stoic even.  Drinks like an old school malt liquor, viscous and malty, the ABV somewhat a giveaway.  OK.  (#7676, 1/2020)\n",
      "750ml bottle from Beer Zoo. Orangey gold colour, white foamy head that dissipates away to a thin rim and aroma of sweet orchardy apple,  fruity., light funk. Taste is sweet, apple, fruity, with some mellow drying tannins. Medium bodied, low carbonation, medium-sweet tannic finish. Nicely drinkable.\n",
      "Pint can courtesy of Anil. Pours a murky pinkish carrot juice with a small white head. Aroma of pink grapefruit, guava, hops and mild pineapple. Taste of pink guava, grapefruit and light pineapple. Sour and tart.\n",
      "Black pour. Small tan head. Old coffee aroma. Taste bitter old coffee. Slightly creamy. Dark. Ok.\n",
      "Tap at Rixter Griile in High Point NC. Dark brown pour. No head. Muted coffee aroma. A bit of blackstrap molasses and plenty of roasted malt and black coffee. Mild and creamy. Decent.\n",
      "Pours a hazy, tan-banana color, with minimal head. Dank aroma, with tropical fruit and some citrus. Flavor follows, along with a fairly bitter, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel not as soft as Atomic Leg Drop. Still a good beer by any standards.\n",
      "Sampled from the Crowler. Pours a hazy deep red with a slightly pink head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has sweet and tart raspberry with a hint of yogurt and wheat underlying. Flavor has tart raspberry with a growing sweetness and a touch of grass underlying.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery.  Comes a hazy pale gold with a nice white head.  Aroma of citrus and tropical fruit.  Taste is grapefruit, pineapple, melons, lemon, mango, and malt.  Nice.\n",
      "Sample at the taproom. Cloudy pinkish-orange color with a medium frothy off-white head that recedes gradually to a film. Strings of lace. Tart fruity aroma with wheat and malt notes. Light-bodied with flavors of tart pomegranate, salty wheat and doughy malt. The finish is sweet-tart pomegranate and wheat. Pretty good overall.\n",

      "On tap at Das Beer Garden. Hazy deep orange. Smells of tropical fruit, oak, and earthy Brett. Lightly cheesy funk. Tastes of oak right up front, tropical fruit behind it, and then brett spicy notes. Dries out and oak lingers with chewy grapefruit in the back. Medium body. Nice.\n",
      "Cask, Temple Brew House. They had a similarly labelled beer on keg, at a lower abv. Light golden colour, hint of haze. Rather rough around the edges, earthy hop notes, harsh bitterness. Not great.\n",

      "Cask conditioned at The Post Office Vaults, Birmingham. Black with tan head. If you like peanut butter you will love this one, sweet roasted peanut flavour throughout, lactose sweetness but there is also a fruity, tangy hint coming from somewhere. Full on, it's just that I'm not over keen on Peanut Butter. Good though.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at The Wellington, Birmingham. Black with tan head. Rich, roasty, dark malts to the fore with this beer, smooth and silky on the palate loads of depth, sticky liquorice notes, coffee extract with a note of fruity plum. Very good.\n",

      "Yellow pour, nice white head. Something very odd happens when I first taste this beer. It's warm. Or rather, it feels warm. It's straight out of the fridge, and I double-check the bottle temperature. Cold. But it tastes warm. It's so soft and full on the palate without any thickness, stickiness, or richness that it feels like a cask ale. I have no clue how TF they do that. But ok...First sip is a bit sweet, a bit herbal. Chardonnay. Saison loveliness.The palate acclimates. How do you slow down on this beer? It's amazing. A guilty pleasure for the fancy saison set, but so much pleasure and so little guilt. Not a beer I'd bring to tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the subtly of my palate—but totally a beer that I'd bring to a tasting to impress my beer nerd friends with the fact that I've got my f'n ear to the f'n rails. I'm going to be picking up multiple bottles of this ASAP, if possible. Not to age—not sure how well it would age—but because I could drink the shit of out this night after night.\n",

      "Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, a nice IPA that has strong west coast influences without being too bitter. Nice hop character with a bit more malt than you see in the NEIPAs.\n",
      "The Aromas are dark malt, roast, molasses and dirty socks. Flavors are Lake Nose, sweet up front, molasses coming out a little stronger and the Bourbon Barrel becomes apparent. I bet boozy in the Finish.\n",

      "500-ml bottle from binnys Lincoln Park. head that fizzed away quickly and completely, orange chocolate nose, creamy, bitter chocolate orange, chemical initially, melded better with some time. rating #1!\n",
      "Draft sampler from brewery, black beer, walnut colored head. Aroma malt, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, cookies. Taste same, with some coffee. Palate medium rich, carbonation moderate. This should be my kinda thing, but it just doesn’t work that well for me and i don’t know why.\n",
      "Sampler from brewery, black beer, almond colored head. Aroma toast, bread, dark malt. Taste same, with , some coffee/grapefruit rind bitter on the finish. Clean, balanced, dry finish. Medium palate, carbonation moderate. Superb.\n",
      "330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 0.5%. Cloudy greyish / dirt brown colour, small white head. Horrible aroma of sweat and a stinking blend of mud and manure. Sweet and slightly sour flavour, nearly undrinkable for me. Drainpour.\n",
      "On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a hazy muffled golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of lacto, with gentle floral notes. Flavour is a yogurt bomb, with lots of lacto and plenty of floral notes. Rather muffled with little depth. Uninteresting.\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Light, pale yellow pour, soft, wispy head. Gentle grain aroma leads into a soft bready teast. Silky smooth, subdued, but full of flavor.\n",
      "Taps opaque chocolate with a good buff head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma gives toffee, roast malt, earthy and subtle honey sweetness. Flavor provides honey, toffee, roast malt, earthy and semi-sweet chocolate. Texture yields firm body and peppy fizz. Thrash it.\n",

      "Taster at brewery. Amber pour, scant head. Supised byt he maltiness of this brew, as I was expceting a hop bomb.  Notes of toffee, malts. slick and sweet. Finishes with a touch of 9v battery.\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Hazy pour, kind of flat. Aroma is citrus, oranges, tangerines. Taste  follows with more citrus on the orange-y side. Kind of light for a 7.1% beer.\n",

      "Tap, Braves Field. Nondescript aroma.  Clear, pale. Candied citrus, fairly hoppy.  Medium body good carbonation.  Kickoff, 2020.\n",
      "Can from Sam: I do not think that this is the freshest... but still... pours somewhat hazy with white head. Aroma is passionfruit, pineapple, citrus. Taste is very fruity, juicy, slightly bitter, a tad herbal. Interesting flavor profile. Much dryer than your average NEIIPA.\n",
      "Dark pour. Bourbon nose. Sweet bourbon taste, like a mixed drink of coca cola and  bourbon with a hop palate.\n",
      "12 ounce can.  Pours black with a decent brown head.  Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, and spice.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, and roasted malt.  Nice.\n",
      "Bottle (missing \"No. 15\") from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours oranged tinged gold with a fine, foamy white head. Aroma is sort of pineapple strawberry. Med body or close. Flavor is very different from my familiar flavors. Flavor is floral, strawberry, guava, citrus - but the fruits named are close but not exactly the flavor in the beer. Floral/fruity covers it. Fairly dry with mildly roasty malt support. Decently bitter. Worth drinking.\n",
      "Black appearance with a light brown head. Aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate, mild coffee, light molasses and light hops. Similar flavor, rich, dark and bittersweet with a smooth balance, a medium body and a lingering finish. Hint of licorice. Good.\n",
      "On tap at the Garden City taproom clear orange golden. No head or bubbles, nearly still actually smooth subtle apple notes. Very faint aroma.  The big ABV isn’t her but again very subtle. A little “winey” but smooth and soft with just a trace of ABV burn at the end\n",
      "Kroger bottle. Clear gold, lots of carbonation, small white head. Pine, light citrus nose. Flavor is canned pineapple, orange peel, sugar. Ends abruptly. Not exactly sweet, but has a bit of sugary sweetness in the middle.\n",
      "On tap at the Garden City taproom. Foggy very light pale lemon color.  Traces of spotty white bubbles.  Big tart apple aromas and flavors with an interesting lemon flavor hit at the beginning.  Finishes with a big full tart apple was.  Quite good\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Near black pour, collar of beige head. Aroma is sweet, malty, cola. Taste continues the sweet notes, light roasty edge.\n",
      "Pale golden appearance with a white head. Mild aroma of toasted grain, white bread and a hint of herbal spice. Similar flavor, adding mild sweetness. Light body with a clean feel and a slight watery finish. OK.\n",
      "Growler from a Subway in Staunton VA. Bourbon and oak nose. Brown, thin tan head. Bourbon, cola. Full body, easy carbonation. Drinks like a Jack and Coke.\n",
      "Taster at brewery. Black, sparse head, streaky lacing. Light roasty aroma. Taste follows with minor sweet notes, more roast and residual bitterness. Seems thin, but actually pretty full.\n",
      "Interesting stuff. Pours a murky dark golden with big white cap that fades to a skim and leaves some lacing. Aromas are foremost Belgian esters along with some melon and dark fruits. Flavors differ from nose with more emphasis on ripe fruit but still some banana and melon. Mouthfeel is large and sticky, a bit cloying on the finish. Definitely a one-and-done, but unique and pretty tasty.\n",

      "Pours hazy apricot with a thick and fairly persistent porcelain head. Aroma yields resiny hops and sweet citrus that reach out and touch you from half a meter away; as you close in, hops get more piney, citrus gains a little tartness, and fresh malt makes an appearance. Flavor lays out piney and slightly bitter hops, tangy and sweet citrus with tropical character on the side, and crisp fresh malt. Texture provides good, smooth body and lively fizz, plus a hoppy and fruity finish. Transcendo ordinary beer!\n",
      "Taster at the Craftroom. Near black pour, persistent creamy head. Aroma is almost non-existent.  Taste is both sweet and roasty, which converts to bitternes at the finish. Malty, cola.\n",
      "Taster at the Craftroom. Dark brown, small, lasting creamy head. Aroma is faint dark malts, tadte is a bit fuller, malty, burnt, bitter. 8%? Wouldn't have guessed that.\n",
      "Taster at the Craftroom. Medium amber, creamy, fluffy head. Aroma brings forth malts, while taste brings the bitterness. Doesn't seem like 150 IBU, probably not, but enough of a bite. Malty to the core\n",
      "Manchester Beer Festival 2020.  Golden in colour, it's basically a steady hoppy session brew.\n",
      "Pours clear, bright light salmon into a tulip. No head.  Sweet plum and lime aromas. Soft with tart plum and lime upfront turning to sweet agave and tart skin in the lasting finish. A little sweet, but good with food.\n",
      "On tap at Bartlett Hall.  Biere Nez Bleu has a semi hazy golden body with a smallish white head.  Aromas of lemon zest, biscuit, pepper, ginger.  Classic example.  Well crafted.\n",
      "Pours a clear, light pink with a white foam head. Aroma is light cherry, mineral, and lactose. Flavor is very lightly tart cherry and some sweetness from the lactose. Light and refreshing.\n",
      "Pint can, bb 14 Apr 2020. Hazy, pale topaz with a cottony spit of foam that fades fairly quickly. Nose is papaya, dank herb, orange zest and pineapple. Flavors of tangerine, wild onion, resin, and orange-pineapple are all a bit tamer than the aroma indicates. Grapefruit with the pith in the finish. Light-medium bodied with medium-plus carbonation and an easy drinking balance.\n",
      "Keg @ Bailey Head, Oswestry. Pours dark, small receding beige head. Cinnamon and chocolate rule the nose. Predictably big bodied, boozy and smooth on the palate with good amounts of cinnamon and chocolate, with marshmallow providing additional layers of sweetness. It's not too unctious or sweet, seems nicely balanced considering the additions. Decent introduction to Heist.\n",
      "On tap at Bartlett Hall in San Francisco.  Captain Chinook pours a cloudy gold/orange with an average sized white head.  This is an oat ipa which gives it a slightly different malt. In a good way, even if subtle.  Nice mouthfeel.  Bold Tropical citrus flavors.  Nice\n",
      "Lots of orange and citrus on the nose.  Light golden haze with a fine white head.  Sweet up front.  Cantaloupe and orange up front.  Sweetness fades quickly and is covers in piney earthy bitterness.  A bit unbalanced.  Watery mouth feel.  Bitter finish.  Meh.\n",
      "Cask @ Bailey Head. Pours a misty unclear golden amber, good white head. Aroma bears a nice hop bitterness, moderately sweet malt. Taste sees plenty of dry bitter hops, juicy marmalade, good malt base. Decent.\n",
      "(At the brewery) Black appearance with a lacy tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, milk chocolate, mild coffee and light hoppy notes. Similar flavor, adding moderate sweetness and a light lingering bitterness. Medium body with a smooth cocoa finish. Good.\n",
      "Keg @ That Beer Place, Chester. Pours misty gold, frothy white head. Excellent vanilla coming through on the nose. Taste is wonderfully balanced, lovely prominent vanilla with a good hop bitterness, light leafy mosaic pine underneath. Good stuff from Shiny.\n",

      "(At the brewery) Clear orange to amber appearance with a lacy beige head. Aroma of toasted malt, floral hops, mild herbs and a light zesty spice. Similar flavor, adding mild bitterness and balanced by a mild sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel with a balanced finish. Well done.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Red Bank. Golden colour, white foam head that dissipates to a thin rim and aroma of sourish apple, oak. Taste is tart, apple, oak barrel, woody, some vinegary funk and fruity notes. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, medium dry finish. Quite drinkable.\n",
      "Taster at the Ocean Beach location. Pours black, with a small, dense, beige head. The aroma is brown sugar, burnt toast, vanilla, toffee, and bakers chocolate. Sweet and malty, with a roasty bitterness. Heavy body, with a syrupy, sharp, and malty palate. Quality and complex stout. Nice.\n",

      "The final pour of the night was something unusual - a fruited brut kolsch. I generally enjoy the dry nature of brut beers. The additional flavors manage to transform it into a release that stands out from the typical kolsch.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",

      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "The blend of black currant and champagne transform this from the typical brut beer to a dark slightly chewy experience.

      "\n",
      "A playful Belgian influenced IPA takes things in a different direction than the usual release. While it still contains that trademark candi sugar it also adds a more malty tone than most. With releases like this I'll be sure to pay more attention to Union Corners in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "A cool base the color of melted chocolate rests under a creamy vanilla head. The laid back core emits waves of malty yeast and candi sugar - almost like an Elephant Ear chased by iced tea. It then melts almost immediately into the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Driven mostly by a malty core the blend of iced tea and yeast warm the tongue. A cool texture grounded in mellow sun tea then melts on the throat.

Flavour is composed of semi sweet, woody roast, rich fruit cake, some booze, cola cubes, tangy dark fruits. Paalte is medium sweet, light tang, moderate carbonation. Good stuff, pretty rich.\n",
      "Keg at stormbird Camberwell. A milky golden orange coloured pour with a halo of white head. Aroma is juicy green mango, pithy citrus tropical fruits, doughy wheat. Flavour is composed milky wheat grains, pissy pithy citrus, grapefruit rind, green hop, sticky mango. Palate is semi sweet, mild hop burn, sticky, spicy moderate carbonation. Decent.\n",
      "Small pour at the main bar at AleSmith. Pours a hazy, pale, straw color, with a small, foamy, white head. Buttery chardonnay, caramel, honeydew, almond, and green apple. Sweet and zesty, with a crisp acidity. Light and creamy. This is a subtle and enjoyable beer. Great balance and nice vinous notes.\n",
      "Cask at Moor Vault - Bermondsey. Pours clear ruby-brown with a frothy, light beige head. Well rounded, nice dose of English yeast, lightly toasted mats, earth, a few leaves, dried berries, earth. Light to medium bodied with fine carbonation; good condition. Finishes with more dried berries, nips of leather and earth. Sound overall.\n",

      "Tap. Black color with beige head. Aroma is cocoa, cinnamon, tonka, mild roast, vanilla. Taste is chocolate, cinnamon, eiskonfekt, quite sweet and boozy, caramel. The aroma is amazing, the flavour a bit too eiskonfekt-like. Some tartness helps drinkability. Smooth velvety mouthfeel with fine-bubbled carbonation.\n",

      "Draft at Pies & Pints on the Banks, served in a snifter. Pours a lightly cloudy gold with a finger of white head that eventually settles into a thick ring and uneven film. The aroma wouldn't lead you to believe there's any fruit at all in here, just standard wheaty-sourdough-straw-light lactic funk Berliner. The fruits are more present in the flavor, but not intensely so. Some melon and pineapple supplement the mango and passionfruit. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry, tart, fruity mouthfeel. Restrained.\n",
      "Draft at Pies & Pints on the Banks, served in a small snifter. Pours a super hazy but evenly hazed orange-gold with a white head that settles into a ring and island of film. Very sweet Creamsicle is all you need to know. Very light hops. Just orange, vanilla, and cream. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a very sweet mouthfeel. A little overboard but fun to try.\n",
      "Cask-conditioned at the Punchbowl (JDW) York, 22/12/2019. Deep brown in colour, with a thin, off-white, head. Caramel, some fruity sweetness, bready malts, citrus hops and orange peel,  leading to a moderately bitter finish. Good.\n",
      "Draft at Pies & Pints on the Banks, served in a small cylindrical glass. Pours a hazy orange with a moderate white head that settles into a thin ring and film, leaving plenty of lace around the glass. Notes of vanilla, sweet doughy malts, cream, floral zest, cherry, blood orange, and pineapple. All adjuncts are definitely present plus a few other notes. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. It grew on me with each sip. Fun beer.\n",

      "Cask at ORB Darlington, 2nd Birthday Festival, as The Beer With No Name. Black brown colour, beige foam head and aroma of roast malt, coffee and chocolate. Taste is malty, roasty, dried fruits, raisins, dark chocolate with coffee, some earthy bitterness and rum hint. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry roasty malty bitter finish. Nicely drinkable\n",
      "Pale yellow body with white head. Grassy and hay aroma.  Malt forward taste with a hop finish.\n",
      "On Tap at the Bend BP   Classic crystal clear light pale yellow with a thin fine blanket of micro bubbles. Good light pale cereal malts.  Modest noble hop flavors and a littel more body and sweetness than typical for the style.  Not bad.\n",
      "Clear bronze with a white head. Aroma of grass, straw, cereal, bread. Light bodied and refreshing.\n",
      "Pours a clear ruby brown with a decent off white head. Aroma is quite malty. Taste is fairly sweet with a slightly dry finish. There are notes of honey, caramel, and toasty malt. Medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. This is a rich malty beer, much better than most of the oktoberfest style beers I have had. Its quite sweet but never cloying.\n",
      "Super crisp bright copper and light amber coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall off-white and tan head. Aroma of bright toffee, earth, grain, caramel, biscuits, deep yeast and a heavy hand of toast and pure malted barley. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong grainy and earthy flavours throughout with a small but noticeable dose of alcohol, toffee, caramelised sugars, some peat and a bit of nuts and softer grassy notes at the finale. Aftertaste shows a more defined biscuity, grainy and earthier side of things with a bit of an off-balance between the malt (heavy) and hops (not very noticeable), however the body itself is good for the style and showing things about right, but seems to miss a good deal of complexity from the lager yeast instead of an ale yeast (which is naturally to be expected for the style), but it seems noticeable that this is good but lacking a touch. Overall, a decent beer with a good profile and biting malt and peat flavour that really shows through, especially at the end. I sampled this twenty ounce (one pint, four ounces) Ontario-styled bottle (slim and narrow) purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 02-December-2017 for US$3,99 sampled at home in Washington on 06-July-2018. \n",

      "Une bouteille de 500ml. Une robe cuivrée avec une mousse beige. Un nez de pain, de biscuit, de malt Munich, léger de caramel. Une bouche toasté, grillée, légère et facile. Agréable avec son côté malt biscuit.\n",
      "Slightly hazy dark amber caramel color with dense activity. Slightly creamy and foamy light brown 2 finger head, lasting around 10 minutes, with generous legs. Flavors of toffee, roasted grains, walnuts, berries, nutmeg, ginger, herbal spices. Toasty and bready, dense malt sugars with decent spicy sharpness. Silky and oily medium body with soft crispy and prickly carbonation. Strong strength tongue coating finish, thick sugary roasted barley, leafy and grassy hops and some red ale spices. Quite spicy, yeasty, and a bit dry and earthy. A little too bold, not like a pleasant and easy Märzen, yet the caramel feel is high quality and quite tasty. Good freshness, although on the thin and flat side. Overall good quality craft.\n",

      "Rated as Night Marzen. Poured a relatively thick bubbly slightly off-white dark amber/orange colour. Good lacing. Nice balance of hops and malts in aroma, with notes of caramel and grains. Has some citric variations for flavour (tropical, sour, orangey, etc...) Medium roasted malts, some yeast is noticeable. Has a yeasty mouthfeel as well, mild palate, a bit tangy. Very good.\n",

Arômes de pain grillé et de sucre d’orge, noisette, avec un houblon qui semble principalement floral avec quelques notes plus herbacées. Également, subtils effluves de céréale rôtie, pâtisserie, biscuit… aussi, agrumes par moment… Nez intéressant, complexité adéquate, intensité plutôt faible cependant. En bouche, pétillement assez élevé sur la langue, onctuosité moyenne-faible au palais. Au goût, pain grillé, céréale rôtie, pâtisserie, biscuit, avec une bonne dose de sucre d’orge, tendance réglisse rouge, baies, petits fruits rouges. C’est suivi d’un houblon qui semble principalement floral avec un peu d’herbes aromatiques (menthe?) et d’agrumes (pamplemousse surtout…), en route vers une finale à l’amertume moyennement élevée. Excellent équilibre malt/houblon, excellente intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles, belle complexité, intensité significativement plus élevée en bouche par rapport au nez.

Medium body, somewhat creamy texture, and average carbonation. Finish is bitterer than the rest but not overly so; surprisingly it is also marked by an increased grain presence. Overall not a bad beer, it has a good feel about it as if it was genuine.\n",

      "On tap at Owl Farm, while watching the very exciting Ravens vs Patriots playoff game. To me this was more like a yeasty farmhouse type ale than a marzen - not sweet enough to be a marzen imo.

En bouche, la bière est mince, le pétillement est modéré et les saveurs voguent principalement autour de l’amertume. Cette amertume se poursuit en arrière-goût quelques secondes avant d’offrir une certaine âcreté de pamplemouse pour clore le débat. C’est intéressant, c’est bien fait, mais ce n’est pas quelque chose que j’achèterais à la caisse...\n",

Flavor of pale sweet malts with notes of pear, astringent hops come through in the aftertaste. Astringent hops taper off to a clean finish. Yeah, I’m game for another.\n",
      "Pours a clear coppery colour. Has a blue cheese aroma that I typically enjoy but not this time. Some pilsner (saccharomyces pastorianus) yeasty-ness about that just sucks. It proves better on the palate but honestly, i can’t drink more than one of these beers per year. i’m good and I will seek out something with more flavour thanks.\n",

      "Appearance: Pours a golden amber colour with almost a finger of white head that quickly dissipates. \n",
      "Aroma: Malt, caramel, bread, yeast, bit of spice but I can’t place it.\n",
      "Flavour: Malt, caramel, biscuit, bit of pepper. \n",
      "Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation. \n",
      "Overall: A great Marzen which I look forward to each year. I found the aroma a bit more subdued than in previous years but it still has that nice rich malt smell.\n",
      "600ml bottle from the lcboPours a clear copper big frothy headLight malt aromaLightly malt thin finish just ok\n",
      "2 finger off white head. orange amber red some little carbination Smells a little sweet and fruity like cherry or strawberry and bitter. Taste is a little watery a little sweet a little cherry or strawberry taste and a bit of some hoppy bitterness/earthyness Easy drinking.\n",
      "Pours a deep woods brown with a creamy one finger cap. It seems to be all Beaus all the time here at the Tiki household (I really dug their Octoberfest 4 bottle sampler this year). This is a sharp Marzen, more crisp than syrupy version the other North American versions of the style I’ve tried. Pretty damn fine. Feel I should be grilling some wurst but I got some ’nawlins gumbo pizza coming to the door.\n",
      "Poured clear orange-amber with a thick foamy off-white head. Vegetal malt aroma. Light-medium body with a crisp, medium dry, tight carbonated mouthfeel.. Aroma his notes of bread, German hops, and a touch of spice. Taste is a mildly bitter but balanced well with notes of caramel amd a touch of earthyness on the finish. Medium body with a low-medium carbonation. Crisp, clean, and refreshing in the mouth.\n",
      "Solid marzen. Good malt backbone. Interestingly light finish due to the hops.\n",
      "Poured into a pint glass, two finger head. Fruits, caramel, spices and a characteristic Beau’s taste. Medium bodied, sweet grainy with a citrus finish! I’ll have another!\n",
      "Limpide, belle couleur orange vif, carbonatation moyenne-haute, nez boisé tout en sucre d’orge et en malts légèrement rôtis. La bouche est sèche, soutenue par une finale houblonnée, mais tout de même ronde et riche. On décèle quelques fruits rouges (cerises douces, entre autres). La levure est nette, totalement en retrait face aux malts et aux houblons qui occupent de façon heureuse tout l’espace. Excellente bière, à la fois goûteuse, complexe et à haute buvabilité.\n",
      "On tap at the Ottawa Beerfest. The night Marzen is a light caramel pour, earthy malts in the nose. A so so Oktoberfest beer. Medium bodied, earthy, a bit musty & tart.\n",
      "On the nose I’m not getting much of anything. Maybe a hint of cereal/biscuit. I’m inhaling and inhaling and there is nothing there. \n",
      "Taste wise, again not much there. A bit of biscuity malts. It is very quaffable in a thirst quenching way, but flavour wise it is sorely lacking. Reminds me of some real old school macro beers.\n",
      "Bottle. Pours light amber, white head. Nose of sweet crackery malt, floral hops. Taste is toast, bitter for the style, lots of crackery malt.\n",
      "Bière de couleur ambré-cuivré avec un beau col résistant. Nez de céréales. En bouche c’est une bière plutôt correct pour le style qui ne révolutionne rien. Belle couleur mis a part cela, rien de bien spécial...\n",
      "bottle. Poured clear orange-amber with a thick foamy off-white head. Vegetal malt aroma. Light-medium body with a crisp, medium dry, tight carbonated mouthfeel. Sweet beer, light citrus notes with a bready malt base and an herbal hop finish.\n",
      "600ml bottle. Pours a clear caramel colour with a frothy, cream coloured, three finger head that leaves some ok lacing.\n",
      "Aroma his notes of caramel, bread, German hops, and a touch of spice. \n",
      "Taste is a mildly bitter but balanced well with notes of caramel amd a touch of earthyness on the finish.\n",
      "Medium body with a low-medium carbonation. Crisp, clean, and refreshing in the mouth.\n",
      "Overall I enjoyed this. Very characteristic for the style but done well. A bit more bitter than some of the other Octoberfest brews I’ve had but that makes it stand out. Well worth a try and you can’t beat the price. Cheers!\n",
      "Poured into a dimpled mug, a nice head formed. An appealing red, clear. Aroma is a bit weak, nevertheless, I smell some biscuit and caramel, maybe a hint of grass. Taste is real good, direct in flavour, and does not become cloying, an ideal session beer. Sweet, malty, with a medium-bitter finish. A bit thin, carbonation medium-heavy. Overall: a success! An attractive fall/winter choice.\n",

      "In bottle from LCBO .. not bad but not in line with true German Marzen’s .. much lighter in color and taste. Overall OK, but wouldn’t buy again\n",
      "Clearest beer I Have seen all night. Almost no head. Smells cooked. Like something fresh out of the oven. Just not sure what. Huh. I don’t know where to place this one. Yeasty which explains that cooked smell. Not a fan\n",
      "couleur cuivrée,arôme de malt munich.goût de malt,très désaltérant,fidèle a la Reinheitsgebot.\n",
      "Bottle. Creamy and toasty and lemony aroma. Crystal clear bronze under a lasting, thin, white cover. Toasty malt flavour that begins sweet and develops into a dry bitterness along with some sour funk. Light body, medium carbonation, lingering bitter finish. Really pleasing toastiness.\n",
      "My Bottom Line :  \n",
      "This malt lover’s Märzen serves up bread crusts, lightly burnt sugar and chewy barley on a most elegant palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further Personal Perceptions :  \n",
      "-A veil of foam covers the translucent pale amber.\n",
      "-Soft carbonation and lean residual sugars combine for a easygoing, cuddly mouthfeel.\n",
      "-Hops are timid throughout. A touch of wooden bitterness in the finish, but that’s it.\n",
      "-Again, beautifully developed soft malt character in this Beau’s lager.\n",

      "---Rated via Beer Buddy\n",
      "(bottle) clear orange amber colour with a small white head; aroma of bread, stewed fruit; nicely balanced flavour with a very long lasting light bitter finish\n",
      "Bottle, shared with TylerDurden before pouring the rest into the toilet. Looks nice enough: orange copper colour with a thick off white head. The aroma is foul, sulphurous and eggy. The palate is tinny caramel with pithy bitterness. Completely unenjoyable.\n",
      "Described as being brewed with oregano rather than hops.  pours standard yellow coloration with white head.  palate much like other lagers but you do get the oregano pretty much right away.  Light citrus, resin, floral, and perhaps some other things out of the spice cabinet.\n",
      "Pours a clear amber colour with a light white blanket over top. Aromas of roasted malt, grass, Munich malt not as rich as a marzen usually is. Flavour is an initial slight sweetness, toast, moderate bitterness and a dry finish.\n",
      "Thanks to cfrancis for this beer. Pours a clear orange with a white top and some spotty lacing. Aroma of yeast, spices, bread & Munich malts. Taste is yeasty, bready, malty and a good bite of hops for the style.\n",
      "Pours a nice burnt orange, with a thin white head. Aroma is grassy hops, cardboard, bread, grains, malt. The flavour is a little more hop forward than I’m use to for this style, some more cardboard, grains, bread, malts. Meh, it’s drinkable, and slightly interesting, but nothing special. \n",
      "\n",
      "Robe rousse ambré, arôme minime de caramel. Goût très doux et pure, une bière somme toute très rafraichissante.\n",
      "600ml bottle. Crystal clear amber, moderate creamy head. Not a strong aroma, costly caramel malt with a hint of fruitiness. Less sweet than I was expecting in the taste, big whole wheat toast on the finish with some noble hops. Very clean and crisp on the palate. Overall, less sweet that other marzens, but very refreshing.\n",
      "Thick foamy off white head, that quickly dissipates. Pours a clear deep amber red. Night malty smell to this beer, with notes of chocolate, oatmeal, and caramel. The smell is deceiving though, the taste is not as malty as the smell would make you believe. A quick malty taste quickly gives way to a dry hops. Notes of resin and pine linger on the tongue, however a slight malty-caramel taste creeps in at the end. Great looking and tasting beer, this is my first Marzen and I am impressed. From what I gather it is not as malty as a traditional Marzen, but it is still a great brew non the less!\n",

      "Purchased a single bottle of this 2012 edition, at the LCBO. Pours a clean amber colour with a foamy off-white head, decent retention and fluffy lacing. Hardly any carbonation. Not as malty as expected for a märzen. More on the hop side. The taste confirms this, but the malt is more present here in the flavours. Bread grains, mild caramel and the hop creating a nice dry bitterness in the finish. So, hoppier than most Okterberfest I have tried, but this makes this one interesting. And let’s not forget \"local\" and \"organic\".\n",
      "750ml bottle. Copper, thick bubbly white head with an orange tint, lots of streaming bubbles. Some fruit, nuts, and spicy hops in mild aroma. Taste is good - soft medium mouthfeel - some malt sweetness up front but a bit watery too - but the back is filled with some sharp hops that kick this one up a notch. Very drinkable. A fine Oktoberfest.\n",
      "It pours copper; the head is off-white and foamy. The aroma has notes of: lemon-zest, walnut, and wet-hay. The taste is light bitter that finishes dry; there are notes of: walnut, lemon, and resin. The palate is medium-light bodied, low carbonation, and medium finish. Overall, it’s pleasant but, lacks intensity.\n",
      "600 ml bottle. Pours a clear, copper-amber with a nice beige head. Smell is malty, caramel. Taste is very malty, lots of caramel, light spices. Touch of herbs, some pepper in there, too. Good finish. Average body, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Not super tasty, not super unique, but a decent  beer nonetheless.\n",
      "Mellow gold colour with almost no carbonation from bottle.  Aroma is bready and doughy.  Taste is mild and ends with a good caramel - like aftertaste.\n",
      "clear dark ruby amber body not much carbonation with thin, offwhite bubbly head.  faint aroma of grass, funk and some smoke.  tasty blend of munich malts, bitter hops offset by sweet malted grains with notes of watermelon.  finsh is clean, well balanced but with a long lasting bitter finish.\n",
      "Clear golden copper pour with big off white head. Aroma of malts, bread, and slight hops. Taste of malts, slight bread, touch of caramel and a lingering metallic hop finish. Medium carbonation and nice mouthfeel. Metallic taste a little off putting.\n",
      "Bottle and on tap: Some tweaking of the old night marzen recipe has created a market improvement. Pours a clear reddish-orange with a decent off-white cap. Aroma is bready -. Noble hop woodiness is a prevailing note, a bit of leafy-earthy mustiness.. Flavor follows aroma - bready - toasty with a adequate whack of Perle hop bittering and woodiness, finish goes dry with a decent noble hop bite at the end, a very good Marzen or Oktoberfest sessioning - drinks well with hot \"wurst\" dinners..\n",
      "Bottle purchase as soon as they were available at the LCBO in Ottawa: Poured a clear amber color ale with no head, no lacing and no carbonation. Aroma consists of light sweet grainy malt. Taste is also dominated by unrefined grainy malt with some light sweet caramel notes. Body has a weird oily texture with no carbonation. Definitely not too good and even wondering if this was a bad bottle as there was no carbonation and malt notes were off – I’ll have to put this on the re-rate list.\n",
      "Pours very light amber with a bubbuyuuly cream head. The aroma is of butterscotch, sweet malt and a bit of fruity yeast. The taste is clean, sweet roasted malt up front, fading quickly to a lingering hop bitterness, kind of strange for the style. Medium-thin bodied. The components of this are good, but don’t quite work together as a cohesive whole.\n",
      "600mL bottle from the LCBO.\n",
      "Orange peel, hops, spice on the nose.  Tastes of orange, caramel, malts.  Thankfully not overly sweet, unfortunately nothing remarkable either.  Softly carbonated, just enough to be noticeable.  Unexpectedly dry on the finish.\n",
      "Even odds of purchasing again however alas Beaus has other much better brews.\n",
      "Growler acheté chez Beau’s. 5.6%. Couleur ambrée, mousse blanche-beige. Arôme de malt, herbes. En bouche, malt, caremal, houblon. Finale avec un elégère amertume, caramel. Très bonne. Manque d’effervescence dans mon growler mais bon..\n",
      "600mL bottle found at the only place in Ontario where you can get held up in line by a guy who dropped a can of Molson Canadian, didn’t have to pay for it and got a free replacement. What a province. This one pours a clear amber-orange. A deliciously deep, grainy malt body steals the show here in both flavour and aroma. In a beer which could have been a touch too sweet, there is a lot of balance achieved through the dryness in the finish which is pulled off quite well. I think the bottles at the LCBO right now are quite fresh, and worth checking out. It’s so nice to see actual Oktoberfest beers this time of year.\n",
      "600 ml bottle from LCBO.  Pours a clear amber/orange with smallish white head.  Aroma is lightly roasty caramel, grains and fruit.  Flavour quite caramelly, a little roasty and grainy with fruit and gentle hops.  Lightly carbonated.  Enjoyable.\n",
      "600 mL bottle. Pours a clear orange tinted copper, firm head of beige bubbles, very pretty. Aroma is fairly vegetal, notes of bell pepper, flowers, and yeasty bread. Medium carbonation and body, smooth on the palate, distinct lager refreshment. Flavors of caramel and toast come through, a little roasted oats and herbs. A touch of sweetness with a light hoppy finish. A nice medium bodied lager.\n",

      "600 ml bottle.  Pours a clear amber with a thick off-white head, bubbles of varying size.  Aroma is dominantly yeast/bready malt and funk. Tastes are medium bitter hops and light sweet (caramel).  Mouthfeel is vibrant but relatively thin.  Finish is a medium, astringent, bitter.  Not bad but not outstanding.\n",
      "Rating #1000 - haven’t gotten around to my backlog and its sorta nice that it ended up being a local brewery - just released for the fall season. On tap at the Atomic Rooster. Vibrant and dark amber with a nice creamy head. A nice amount of malt , slightly resiny hops, brown sugar, grains. Moderate carbonation and decent body, definitely bitter with a nice sweet malty undertone, some fruit and more malt on the finish. I would drink this again for sure.\n",
      "600ml bottle. A clear copper body, medium beige head. Aroma of herbal/floral hops, good dose of malt, cereal, caramel, rye bread. Taste dominated by a good amount of malt, rye bread, herbal hops bitterness, caramel. Long bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "Draft at the 8 Locks Flat Canal-side bar/restaurant Ottawa, the just released 2012 Oktoberfest offering. A reddish ale with a white head. Aroma of caramel and mal. Tastes of  sweet fruity notes malt and nuttiness. Pleasant fuller flavoured lager.\n",
      "Orange pour with an off-white head.  Aroma is bready malt, some grassy hop notes, slightly sweet.  Flavor is sweet, a bit malty, lightly hoppy.  Decent.\n",
      "Orange/auburn with ample but short lived head.  I get barley (shocking i know, but that’s what comes through), bread.  Light hopping.  Balance, pleasant.  Some off-flavours.\n",
      "Pour golden orange with white head. Aroma Oktoberfest beer, sweet malt, grassy noble hops. Taste Munich malt, grassy hops, great grassy bitterness, caramel, hay, cereal. MF medium crisp body. what a surprise big full flavor and quite bitter a terrific surprise well done.\n",
      "Bottle. Orange pour, very small head. Aroma is grains. Taste is bready malts, nice bitter hops, a little citrus. Decent.\n",
      "On cask at C’est What in Toronto, served in an English pint glass. Pours clear orange-amber with a small, off-white head. The head fades to a thin remnant and leaves no lace. On the nose, there are notes of biscuit malts, bread, citrus, fruit and a touch of herbal hops. The flavour is balanced between slight sweetness and slight bitterness. Toasted malts balance with delicate herbal and resinous hops. The flavour becomes slightly more bitter towards the end, leading up towards a clean, malty finish with herbal hops. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a balanced but bland example of a märzen. It could be a lot more complex, both on the malt side and the hop. 2011-12-17\n",
      "from bottle. pours a clear deep copper colour with a decent head in my pint glass. Recognisable lager aroma, nothing spectacular. Take a sip and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. This is a full bodied and equally full flavoured example of a Marzen with an excellent lingering bitterness that’ll last until your next mouthful.\n",
      "600mL bottle from the LCBO.  Pours a gorgeous clear amber with a good white head.  Aroma is standard decent lager smell.  But the taste - wow!  Big surprise, this is a very full-flavoured lager.  Perfectly balanced notes of caramel, slightly-roasted barley, and delicious hops.  Big body for a lager.  This is  a terrific lager!  Well done, Beau’s.  Oktoberfest is long since over, but I enjoyed with a dinner of sausage with sauerkraut.\n",
      "I liked this one.  Taste comes strong on the tongue and melts into bitter orange peel.  The problem is I had this after a truly spectacular beer.  The good thing for it is that it wasn’t that disappointing, considering.\n",
      "Tap at Rhino. The aroma has a lot of soft sweetness and a little bit of light sweetness. It’s a little bit sweet with a touch of soft DMS. There is a little bit of fairly dirty esters that I could do without. Fairly pronounced bitterness but it’s not really all that good.\n",
      "600ml bottle, amber-orangeish color, with a bubbly beige head, mild grainy biscuity, toasted, caramel malt, faint nutty nose, with a light herbal fruity, leafy, grassy hop note, and some wet hay, bready cerealic accent in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a crisp cereal, toasty, caramel, bready, munich malt, subtle toffee character with a mild earthy flowery leafy, grassy hop backbone, with a light lemon, grapefruit peel hoppy undertone, leading towards a mellow cereal maltiness, lingering zesty citrusy, leafy, grassy hop bittering finish.\n",
      "4 oz on cask at Beau’s Oktoberfest 2011, October 2, 2011. Dirty orange, little head. Aroma of barley a little dry, hints of wheat. Slightly sweet taste of barley, dried hops with notes of herbs, a little bitter. Quite delicious!\n",

      "Nice pint of Cask at Burger Bar, Kensington Market. Tastes fruity and a bit mineral with slightly herbal dry hops. Yep, pale fruit and earth. A good one.\n",
      "tap at Oktoberfest. dark amber colour with small off white head that holds. aroma is bread and yeast. grainy taste with a slightly fruity sweetness to it. light bodied. like all beaus beers, crisp and clean. great session beer.\n",
      "Tap at volo, pour is fairly light, the graininess is there, a bit smooth on in the finish, overall it wasnt my fav but it was drinkable\n",
      "600 ml bottle from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass. \n",
      "App.:  Clear deep amber with a white rim.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Aroma:  Grains and cereals, wet hay, a little grassy, faint fruitiness and maybe esters, a touch earthy/nutty, hints of British-style malts, some biscuit.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Palate:  Medium body, moderate effervescence with some prickly bubbles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Flav.:  Grain/cereal, a little mashy, some wet hay/grass, a little more fruitiness (still quite restrained), some slightly peppery hops, earthy notes, not bad; dry with restrained bitterness and a peppery, biscuit malt finish with hints of fruitiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosst!\n",
      "Pretty nice beer. Good earthy/grassy start with some solid sweet backing and a pretty good bitterness to finish. Nice bite on the end as well.\n",
      "The Festive’Ale the Altbier variation (darker malts, mainly) off the LugTread. Then, consider the NightMarzen like the Marzen’s take off the LugTread. Albeit a really bitter take on the Marzen style. Pours amber. Hops are grassy/earthy. Typical Beau’s Malt (grainy, and somewhat caramelized for the darker ones). All in all -- it’s probably overly bitter for its style, but still a well-made beer if you like that brewer, because they don’t get that much diffrent from the LugTread and the FestiveAle.\n",
      "Cask at C’est What - came a clear amber/orange, with a tight, almost nitro-looking cask head.  Aroma of toasted grains, amber malt, a hint of earthy hops.  Flavour similar - malt-driven, soft, luxuriously malty, toasty, great mouthfeel from the cask.  Endlessly drinkable.  Has the Beau’s \"house taste\", and at times seems like a fuller-bodied, more complex version of little brother Lug Tread.  Solid brew, glad I finally got to try it.\n",
      "500ml draught \n",
      "5.6% ABV \n",
      "I tried this beer on December 22, 2010 at \"Bar Volo\" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a beautiful translucent cherry red, with a thin white head.  The aroma is grainy malt, light fruit, caramel, and weak floral hops.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.  The flavour was a perfect balance between the malty sweeetness and the hoppy bitterness.  Easy to drink!\n",
      "Verre de 12 oz dégusté chez Black Tomato (Ottawa, ONT). Arôme: Légère odeur de céréales et d’houblons. Apparence: La couleur est dorée avec une faible densité de bulle. Présence d’un moyen col mousseux avec une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Léger goût de céréales avec une pointe d’houblons et de fruité. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement aqueuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Légère présence de céréales en arrière goût. (Rating #3424)\n",
      "Cask Sample at Toronto Beer Experience. Pours amber with small white head (though this difficult to determine in sampling goblet. Not unlike Lug Tread. Quite pleasant.\n",
      "on tap at beau’s oktoberfest 2015 - and many samples years back when it was ’’nightmärzen’’. almost clear bright amber-red with a creamy off-white cap offering some retention and lacing. toasted fruity maltiness - very nice use of specialty malts, lagering goodness, tasty wild berries, woodsy and spicy. light carbonation, light body - oily; balanced and smooth woodsy-grassy-spicy finish. very solid märzen.\n",
      "Bottle - 750ml. Nice amber body with a fair off-white frothy head. Decent malty/hoppy aroma with some brown sugar hints. Its hoppy taste carries malty, sweet, and woody notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish. Average Märzen.\n",
      "Big ceramic from the brewery in trade. Copper with a moderate head. Moderate chewy grain aroma. Tastes a lot like Lug Tread with added caramel.\n",
      "at Bar Volo Cask Days 2009.  Dark ambar colour. Malty aroma, malty hoppy flavour, slightly noticeable wood flavour\n",
      "This is my first foray into marzen and it’s a winner!  Orange/brown colour with a generous frothy head.  Aroma is wood, malt and spice.  Taste is really well balanced.  Flavours of hop, wood and spice tickle the palate.  I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and will definitely be looking forward to this seasonal every year!\n",

      "Had at volo cask days 2009, golden orange color, nice foam, nose has some wood and a good dose of grassy hops. flavor follows suit and is i think quite delicious\n",
      "Volo Cask Days 2009. Dark amber pour, odd tart aroma, with some woodiness and biscuity malt. The wood cask really added a subtle woodiness. Flavor was good and hoppy, with a good malt back bone. Interesting take on the style.\n",
      "Cask sample at Volo Cask Days 2008. Slightly hazy golden-red colour. Aroma is odd, with a tart fruitiness not expected from the style, but not unpleasant. Flavour is also oddly spicy and fruity with a fairly hoppy finish. I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t quite get it either.\n",
      "[1790-20081017] Cask. Boozy spiced fruit grains aroma. Murky, medium orange brown body with no head. Mild grains and fruit flavour with long finishing mid-tones. Medium body. Not much there but drinkable.\n",
      "(Cask Days 2008 @ Volo; Toronto, ON)\n",
      "A golden amber marzen with a thick lacing white head. A caramel malt aroma, with light vegetable notes, a bit of mashed beans, and sweet fruity esters in finale. In mouth, a nice crisp malt with light berry and grape notes, nutty finales, and hops coming as beer warms up. A good beer. Medium bodied. On tap at Wellington Gastropub, Dec. 11 2008.\n",
      "Re-rate from the bottle this time.  Copper, thick bubbly white head with an orange tint, lots of streaming bubbles.  Some fruit, nuts, and spicy hops in mild aroma.  Taste is good - soft medium mouthfeel - some malt sweetness up front but a bit watery too - but the back is filled with some sharp hops that kick this one up a notch.  Very drinkable.  A fine Oktoberfest. Original 6/3/6/3/13 = 3.1\n",

      "On cask, Volo cask days 2008.  Copper pour small white head.  Mild malty aroma with hints of fruit and some hops.  Taste follows, more malt with light hops and perhaps a light spiciness.  Pretty poor notes I must admit.\n",
      "Cask.  At Volo Cask Days 2008.  Ah, another Beau’s.  Cloudy orange pour, wispy whiteish head.  While not horrid, smells like malt extract and spoiled OJ.  Tastes of wet grain and orange oil (which isn’t something I would normally willingly drink).  Slick, somewhat thick mouthfeel, acidic and coatingly bitter in the linger - ehhh, it’s a Beau’s, my expectations weren’t that high so no worries.\n",
      " cask at Volo \n",
      " Appearance:  Murky hazed amber brew with light rocky top  Nose:  Vinous, fruity with sweet malts, bit unusual. Flavor/Palate : Medium full bodied, sweet banana , plum and bitter wet hop character with sticky malt as base. Smoother at finish.\n",

      "Cask at ’Volo Cask Days 2008’. Pours a cloudy orange-copper with no head. Aroma of tart fruit, light spices, light hops and malt. Flavour’s fruity and spicy along with caramel malt and a light bitter finish, though a bit milder then I’d like. Average bodied. Nothing great, like I said it’s somewhat mild, but a good beer nonetheless.\n",

      "on cask at volo. cask days 2008. orangy/brown with almost no carbonation. subtle malt playfulness with fruity aspects as the main focus. some hop bitterness but not over hopped. a nice break from the hop bombs and a solid brew all around.\n",
      "2008-10-17. Murky orange amber body, tiny ring of head. Nice fruity aroma, orange, citrus peels, light yeast. (7+) Similar flavour is fairly bitter, lightly astringent citrus/hops, light malt. (7+) Smooth average bodied palate feels light at times. Does not seem to be very stylistically accurate to me, perhaps they upped the hops for Cask Days? Fairly quaffable regardless. Not a bad start to Cask Days! Cask @ Volo Cask Days 2008\n",

      "16 oz draft pours an light orange color with a small white head.  Aromas of citrus, pine, resin, a good old fashioned west coast IPA.  Medium bodied, nicely balanced, a very good beer.\n",
      "500 ml. bottled 10/29/2019. Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.\n",
      "Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.\n",
      "Acquired a can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom! Can date of 1-21-20. Is this any different than then King Julius? Maybe a tad more juice? How much juice can one IPA actually have? After reviewing my notes of king Julius...  Yes this has a huge juicy character. This also has absolutely no bitterness. No green hop either. So the fruit juice, lasts and lasts and lasts. This really is tasty. Soooo, ok... I like it.\n",

      "Can as a gift around X-mas.  Super cloudy, apricot in color, good head. Good lacing left on the glass. Nose of biscuits and flaked oats. Taste is tons of tropical fruits. Mango, apricot, banana, tangerine, oranges, etc. Well balanced with a good malt body.  Smooth for a 7% beer. Overall this is an easy drinking, good tasting beer.\n",
      "Draught. Pours lightly hazy dirty orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Heavy pine, spruce, and resin hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bready malt, light alcohol, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "Reddish brown beer with a medium head. A nice doppelbock with a kick. Compared to the other schlenkerla beers, this beer has a more spicy smoke tast. if the normal bock is smoked ham, this is smoked beef. Very nice\n",
      "Botlle. Nose is malty,  dark fruit, plums, raisin. Taste is dark malts, dough, spice, hint of almond, roast, herbal hop not, touch of chocolate in the body with a bitter finish. \n",

      "35.5cl can at home, bought at Just in Beer. Appearance: dark brown with a medium to big beige head. Aroma: dark roast coffee and coffee grounds, peppery, slight vanilla. Taste: moderate sweetness and fairly high bitterness. Mainly coffee and coffee grounds, with some peppery notes, rye, some licorice root. Palate: medium bodied, watery to oily texture and soft carbonation. Overall: pretty good! even though the body is not too strong, it is perfect for this style.\n",
      "Bottle from my local off license ‘Wine Rack’.\n",
      "Pours a very hazy amber/orange colour with a large foamy off-white head. Aromas of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, banana, pine, zesty, floral, wheat and grass. Taste is more of the same notes, tropical, citrus, orange, grapefruit, floral, hints of tea with a zesty earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Fair carbonation. Medium bodied with a very slightly oily mouthfeel and a long fruity hop aftertaste. Excellent\n",

      "Brown with a foamy head that soon turns whispy. Big medicinal aroma, a cherry/raspberry blend cough syrup. Herbal too though. With a bit of time out of the bottle it really does start to smell like a PB&J. The intense peanuty note is probably the highlight of this brew. Taste is bittersweet, full of earthy peanut shell and sweet artificial cough drop. Body is medium, carbonation moderate, texture watery. Probably the most disappointing tough 50 brew I‘ve tried, at least for such a major style.\n",

Medium to full bodied, a bit of a surprise for a Darkness brew, the blend is good, and there is a solid alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly with barrel. The barrel is nice. This overall is a bit disappointing add expecting more Darkness body to stand-up more with the barrel. 15\n",

      "J'avais une certaine appréhension en decapsulant cette Westmalle double tant la triple est pour moi un graal absolu et tant le style des doubles est un style compliqué. J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur. Un manque d'envolée lyrique qui nous empêche une parfaite élévation spirituelle, mais une double bien faîte et agréable.\n",
      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live! Caramel bready malty body with a moderate sweetness. Mild soft hop aromas in the back. A good Märzen.\n",
      "Beautifully fresh (2 month for an American beer in HK is a luxury), it's even better than I remembered. Although they write APA, this is rather a NEIPA, pours hazy orange, soapy head, not much of lacing. Nose of tropical fruits, grapefruit and grass. Tastes bitter, minor malts are overwhelmed by fresh fruity Citra hops. Smooth and highly pleasant, ale.\n",
      "Hazy light amber appearance with a beige head. Aroma of toasted malt, bread, fruity esters, mild herbs and light banana. Similar flavor, malty and yeasty sweetness with mild fruit and a light spicy bitterness. Medium body with a soft feel and smooth finish.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from a six-pack brought back from Raley's in Chico, CA.  The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!\n",
      "Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.  Overall: too sour, too little going on, and I'm not convinced the cherries or poppies are doing anything.\n",
      "Bottle shared at bowling opaque black with moderate tan head. Nose bourbon, coffee, mineral chocolate. Taste coffee, molasses, almost maple, mineral chocolate. Light bourbon.\n",
      "Wow. Great oatmeal stout. Strong roasted malt aroma. Perfect dark and foreboding color. Flavors were full with a silky body.\n",
      "16 oz. can shared by drsordr. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium plus sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale malts, lightly toasted, mild sweetness, citrus and earthy hops, grass, some onion character but this is a well put together beer, I am always cautious with 100% Mosaic hopped beers but this was very good.\n",
      "Can from JPs shared with alexsdad06 pour lightly hazy light gold with moderate white head. Nose grassy, resin, light onion, some sweet malt. Taste similar to nose, big grass, light earthy. Some balancing sweetness.\n",
      "Draft at beer culture on 45th. Cloudyish pour. Citrus, hops, honestly maybe the best neipa on history. Balanced like it's walking a tightrope.\n",
      "Pours very dark ruby brown with big foamy head. Aroma is surprisingly close to weissbier with banana and cloves, burnt sugar, wood, dark dried berries. Flavor is sweet and mellow, full body but not too heavy with pleasant texture, hidden but a bit noticeable alcohol, malty and a bit fruity (dark overripe fruits).\n",
      "750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!\n",
      "A 22 fl. oz. bomber with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter glass. It was dark brown to black in colour with a very thin brown head that disappeared almost immediately and left only sparse lacing. Aromas of whiskey, roasty, chocolate, with hints of oak, molasses and vanilla. Tastes of sweet bourbon whiskey, roasty, chocolate, molasses, and oak, with notes of vanilla and caramel and maybe even some char. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, although perhaps a little sweet for me, the roast and chocolate did mostly balance it out for me, and it was still an enjoyable sipper.\n",

Bouche vive, crémeuse, ronde et onctueuse avec candi, pruneau, mélasse, chocolat, épices, petite acidité. Carbonatation moyenne et finale un peu sirupeuse, amère et épicée.

      "Sierra Nebmvada really knows how to celebrate an anniversary. Their 40th IPA is truly a victory of brewing. It's a balanced affair that channels their west coast pedigree while still delivering interest and quality. A solid light malt backbone lifts an impressive resiny piney hop bill that is both familiar and engaging at the same time.  Nice long hoppy finish that still manages to avoid rindiness. Quite clean. Awesome lacing too. This is why they are the west coast kings.\n",

      "On tap at Lunar Brewing Co. dispensed to a shaker showing a clear & bright, orangey/gold hue, with a decent layer of soft white froth, and doily-like cling as lacing. The nose was lightly dank & resinous, with citrus, pit fruit, and a nice malt backing. Medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste was similar, adding a healthy citrus, rind, and resin bitterness that lingered. A welcome and tasty, old school, West Coast IPA, but milestone anniversary worthy?\n",

      "Golden, hazy, white beerhead with frothy, thick and lacing foam. Good retention. The aroma is hoppy, such as floral, fruity (kiwi, mango, banana) spices and somehow herbal. Medium sweetness, medium carbonation, medium bitterness, and smooth touch. Alcoholic warmth.\n",
      "Copper colour, creamy foam atop. Brown sugar/caramel, creamy, malts, bready, fruit/melon undertones... it really has all you need in a 'standard' bitter. Excellent example of the style.\n",
      "Bottle from M&S.  BB Aug 2021; Drank Jan 2020 - Very dark brown / black.  Small tan head.  Very malty, roasty malts, dark chocolate, coffee, liquorice.  Moderate hop bitterness.  Dried fruits, raisins.  Spicy.  Sweet-bitter dry roast chocolate and coffee malty hoppy fruity and spicy.  Dry burnt roast finish.  Enjoyed this.  Good one.  (2020-01)\n",

      "Bottled, 330ml from Pump it Up, Belper, Derbys. Deep dark chestnut with cream head. This is rich and smooth from the off, darkly roasted malts with a note of caramelisation, some sweet toffee'd notes, liquorice. Fruity tones come through, red port wine, grapes and fig flavours. Easy on the palate, notes of dry plum in the close. Loved it.\n",

Bitterish and spicy wet wood. Soft fruity bourbon, also with a tingling spice. A vague rubbery tone. Tingling spicy warning finish. Tidy barleywine but could be less harsh.

      "Orange wax 2018. Black and oily with no head. Aroma and flavour start with earthy mushrooms, coconut and soy sauce. Later there's more and more sweet whisky. Full and oily. Finish has some red fruit port notes.\n",

      "Lemony-piney nose with a touch of stone fruit. Medium light body. Nice hop flavor with a  moderate bitterness. Pleasant bitter finish, no harshness. Very drinkable, but the ABV is a bit on the high side for a mid-to-light IPA.\n",
      "650 ml bottle poured at home. Pours brown with a tan head. Smells like caramel, malt and nuts. Taste is heavy caramel with a nutty finish. It’s good.\n",
      "Pint can. Somehow this manages to be both ripe and kinda green at the same time. Tangerine, grapefruit, mango, greenish pineapple, peaches in syrup, green banana, a tiny bit of earthy dankness, and very little Citra/cat piss juju. Velvety, creamy texture as always, slightly stronger carbonation than usual for BdBC (I think). Bitter orange peel hops linger and expand on the long, smooth finish. Yet another fantastic hop blend from the masters thereof.\n",
      "330ml bottle at home.  Clear amber brown with a long-lasting creamy beige head.  Toasted malt, dark bread, toffee, plums.  Medium carb, light-medium body.  Smooth finish with sweet malt and dark fruit.   Easy drinking and delicious.\n",
      "W aromacie truskawki jak z Bobo Fruta i lekka kwasowość. W smaku truskawkowe, kwaśne i słodkie zarazem. Bardzo przyjemne. Bezalkoholowy hit, choć bardziej niż sour IPA można to traktować jako koktajl owocowy.\n",

Has some light undertones that make it an interesting blonde. Thinker on the palate than most blondes this abv I've ever had. Medium to hight sweetness. Good blonde with some different nuanced flavors.\n",

      "Bottle 12 fl oz. Black with a creamy brown head. Complex aroma, roasted malt, bourbon and something I couldn’t define. Extreme rich taste of everything you would categorize as “stout taste”, with a sweet touch and a surprising bitter finish. Nice one, but prefer the KBS.\n",
      "Pours pitch black with a creamy tan head. Aroma is heavy in chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, slight coffee and maple. \n",
      "Taste is very rich and sweet with some dry bitterness throughout. Full body, good carbonation, and creamy on the palate. Longggg finish, good mouthfeel.\n",
      "delicious and strong beer. tons of hops, great flavor. well deserved ranking. worth the price.\n",
      "Bottle from virgin wines. Had always passed this one by. Readily available in Waitrose. Just not a fan of sugar listed as an ingredient in beers. Added sugar that is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Poured into a wine glass, chilled down. Look great, deep dark amber brown with lots of yeast and bottle conditioning bits floating around. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking my time with this one. It's too cold and all the flavour and texture and been dulled down, but initial notes of sweet dried fruits, confectionery, caramel. Bit of malty funkiness, typical abbey beer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not a beer to glug back. Rich taste, sweet, fizzy, smooth, very good mouthfeel and texture. Full bodied, more sweetness. It's not where I am at with beer really but can't say it's not a quality brew.\n",
      "[email protected], Brussels. Almost black, large brown head. Nose coffee, mIlk chocolate. Smooth texture, lightly sweet taste in line with the aroma..\n",
      "Can. It pours hazy yellow with a creamy white head. The aroma is pineapple, passion fruit, light pine, spicy citrus, resin and oranges. Little lime. Moderate sweetness and moderate bitter hoppy flavor. Great!\n",
      "Can @ Plovmands. Aroma of citrus tropical dank, crisp, fresh. Light sweet and bitter with lingering fruityness. Light and juicy\n",
      " Great\n",
      "Tap at BTST. Golden color small white head. Nice tropical fruity aroma. Nice hoppy taste, with tropical fruits, zest, pines. Medium long hoppy bitter finish.  Nice.\n",
      "[email protected], Brussels. Hazy milky yellow, smooth white head. Nose apples, hints of pepper. Taste very much follows; rather low in bitterness, more fruity (apple) and some black pepper motes.\n",
      "Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt notes with some light toffee and some fruity hops notes are also noticeable. Taste is also a mix of caramelized malt with some cereals notes and light toffee with some fruity hops and a fairly dry finish. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Enjoyable but I prefer the version where they stick to malt and avoid those new world hops.\n",
      "Feb 2020. 330ml dark bottle part of a BeerHawk £1 a beer deal. These deals are quite random. The previous pack was so good I ordered another, but this one has been fairly ordinary - rather a lot of under 5% beers which I've already had. This is a new rate for me, but is it a 4.2% lager, so not exactly otter's tears. Meh. It's drinkable, but it does taste like what it is. Sigh. Can't believe this is actually a Thornbridge beer.\n",
      "Tap at Beer Stars 2/2020. Commercial description is spot on. Rather thin, med-high carbonation, refreshing, easy drinking. Med-high bitterness, malt in background. Shitloads of exotic, citrusy, garlicy, overall fruity explosion. Very good.\n",
      "Tap at Beer Stars. Hoppy aroma and taste, citrus fruit, grassyness, medium bitter, light sweet notes. Medium to full body, hoppy fruity bitter sweet finish. Very good.\n",
      "Rød mørk øl med groft skum, der hurtigt forsvinder. Duft af karamel. Smag af karamel, med en let og fin bitterhed, der lægger sig fint på ganen og en god fylde. En virkelig god øl.\n",
      "\n",

      "Kaboom. Loved this. A real thick, dense, liquorice heavy tarry rope porter. Very full bodied with coffee notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours jet back with a lasting tan head. Mouth coating and full and rich. Brilliant porter.\n",
      "Maybe the most balance \"IPA\" beer i have drink until now. The beer is not too bitter or too sweet. Is average in both direction. Also is very rich and has many fruits inside like Peach, tangerine, apricot, grapefruit, orange, mango ect.. And these fruits together make one awesome mouthfeel and taste overall. The finish has long direction and you get some kind bitterness.. The carboration is soft and you dont get any level of alcohol.\n",
      "Overall is one of the best \"IPA\" i have drink but is a big word to say \"This is the best \"IPA\" in the world..\n",
      "Tap @Luppolo Station (Rome-Italy). Great pour, golden bright a bit orangey with a tick medium cap. Nose: esters, yeast, banana-clove hints, spices. Mouthfeel: alcohol is a bit over the top, pretty sweet malty with a light spiciness.\n",
      "Hazy straw colour. Big, fluffy head. Refreshing and funky aroma of nettles and grapes. Refreshing and sourish taste of goose berries, nettles and grapes.\n",
      "Growler from Growler Guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic rich amber, white head. Wonderful toasty aromas and all the right malt character. Yeast abundant but never over the top, so clean, rich, gently sweet, subtle hop close. Masterful.\n",
      "A dark brown beer, a head is quite small and beige. Aroma is complex, lots of dried fruitness, raisin, apricot, some liquorice, also barrel and caramel, hint of alcohol. Taste has caramel, raisin, liquorice, barrel, hint of herbal spicyness. Nicely pretty dry even the sweet elements. Almost full bodied. Interesting and complex blend, but balanced. Great beer.\n",
      "Eingetrübte goldene Farbe mit großer weißer Schaumkrone. Hefiger, fruchtiger, malziger Geruch. Geschmacklich hefig, fruchtig, malzig, schwach hopfig. Mittlere Süße mit leichter Bitterkeit, mittlerer Körper mit spürbarer Kohlensäure.\n",
      "500ml bottle, 2018 vintage. Rich toffee malt aroma with notes of caramel malt, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon. Pours deep brown with a thin mocha brown head that has little retention or lacing. Starts with rich toffee, caramel and chocolate malt flavors as well as having a full body and slick, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes impeccably smooth with wonderful vanilla, bourbon and oak flavors. Fantastically smooth and wonderful variant of the classic stout.\n",
      "Nearly clear darkish gold pour with a two finger, creamy to fluffy off white head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing. Aroma of citrus and spruce, some light caramel, bread and a hint of biscuit. Flavor is bitter citrus, pine resin, spruce tips, husky grain, light caramel, light herbal hops and some interesting mineral notes push through the surprising bitterness in the finish. Medium body, slightly syrupy feel, mostly dry, moderate hop acid bite. Good stuff, nothing to special, just a solid classic west coast IPA.\n",
      "Bottle. Grapefruit hop citrus aroma with notes of pine resin and caramel malt. Pours clear amber colored with a large tan head that has excellent retention and some lacing. Starts with caramel malt and grapefruit hop citrus flavors. Finishes dry with pine resiny hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. Classic west coast IPA.\n",
      "500ml can from Brewdog Outpost Tower Hill. Amber colour with white head. Big pine resin hops, big citrus hops, pink grapefruit, lemon pith, tropical fruit hops, orange pith, dank, light yeasty,  light mango, light biscuit malt. V drinkable for 8%, feels kind of like a middle ground between west coast and New England, great one\n",
      "12 ounce bottle. Tawny gold pour. Large frothy beige head. lightly fragrant citrus hop nose. Sharp citrus and pine right up front. Some toasted malt as well. Firm malty body shows some toffeeish qualities. Resiny hops in finish. Definitely West Coast pedigree. Well balanced and flavorful. Happy Anniversary to one of the great pioneering Craft Breweries in the USA. Cheers!\n",

Aroma is a little sappy, some corn syrup, bit of mineral and mango.  Body is medium-weight, a bit syrupy, lightly starchy and watery, carbonation is moderate, medium burn, medium-big coarseness.  Flavor is a bit of corn and corn syrup, touch of lemon zest and lychee, touch of tree, hint of sap underneath.  Nice American interpretation of a pilsner!\n",

      "Look: hazy ochre yellow with a large white frothy head. Nose: fine esters including banana, apples, dried fruit. Additional clove. Medium body. Lively carbonation. Taste: perfectly balanced wheat-banana-esters-clove situation. Low bitterness. Spicy warming alcohol instead. Great Weizenbock.\n",
      "Rubinowe brunatne, piana mikra. W aromacie rum, rodzynki, karmel, chleb. W smaku dokładnie to samo. Lekko szczypiacy w język alkohol. Średnie nasycenie. Pełnia srednia\n",

      "Keg at Waterloo Tap. Carmel aroma. Dark and glossy. Creamy beige head. Sweet carmely aroma with a salty edge. At some stage it's been burnt. Actually, yes, there is some underlying cake. Light-medium bodied. Slick. Astringent finish. It was going really well until I noticed the body and, specifically, the finish. That drops a few points.\n",
      "Bottle at home. 2014 vintage. Pours a slightly hazy dark brown colour with no head. Aroma of smoke, whisky, smoked ham, BBQ sauce, brown sugar, dates and ryebread. Flavour of whisky, smoked ham, dates, ash and tobacco. Warming alcohol in the end. Has a silky mouth feel, full-bodied and a light bitterness. A perfect match between a barley wine and whisky. Incredibly balanced and pleasant to drink. Smoked and sweet and a little bitterness to balanced it. Just wow!\n",

Thick and creamy on the palate, a touch of burnt sugar, chocolate fudge, a slight floury cakiness in the texture, then more cocoa on the finish, plus a hint of red wine, a little ashiness and a espresso bitterness. A delicious - and scarily moreish - liquid dessert.\n",

Flavor is heavy with the malt and molasses and licorice, lots of booze, caramel, tar.  The coconut is there, but it's very muted.  Full bodied, fusel and boozy finish.\n",

Textura sedosa, cuerpo medio-denso y carbonatación alta. Simplemente la mejor Hefeweizen del mundo, punto. Compleja, sabrosa y de textura suave.\n",

      "12 oz. bottle from Craft Beer Cellar - South City. Pours a deep, dark, cloudy amber with a moderate beige head that settles into a ring and streak of film, leaving a couple ropes and spots of lace in the glass. Notes of oak, brown sugar, vanilla, toast, tea, toffee, raisins, candi sugar, bourbon, dates, caramel, and chocolate. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, malty, warming mouthfeel. Another nice blend. Love this series.\n",

Easy-quaffing flavor balance works a bit better, but overall it's pretty underwhelming and dull. But hey, at least it isn't dirty like most modern IPAs.\n",

      "440ml can brewed in England at 6.2%. Near-black pour, black in the glass. Brown head, decent size, OK duration. Low carbonation. Slight but deep stout aroma, hints of wood. Taste follows, with a particular dry, roasted finish. Very nice stout, and at least going by the label, its flavour is accomplished without actual additions of coffee or cacao - always a plus, especially from a talented organisation like Cloudwater, who really ought to be able to make a killer stout with minimal to no additions. Then again, I just don't know how much of this beer is down to them and how much to Salt. The label is a bit flowery, but \"toasted teacake base\" does describe the malt here quite well - at least the none-roast elements. This is a stouty stout, and a good example of what a stout can be that a porter can not - any chocolate flavour here is minimal, and very much on the dark side, and the roast flavour overpowers any out-and-out coffee elements. Sweetness is there, but appears to emanate from the beer, so to speak. The dry, almost ashy finish is the key note of this beer, and quite a welcome taste. Good flavour for the ABV - I wish Cloudwater would add a good stout or two to their core range some time, as they clearly have the ability to make a strong contender in the style if they put their mind to it. Something like this would fit the bill, along with perhaps an Imperial. Just saying!\n",
      "Bottle from SimonTomlinson via the RB EU 2019-3 trade. Black with a frothy to creamy beige head. Aroma full of roasted grains, dark chocolate and coffee. Taste bittersweet with the the roasted bitterness taking over the finish. Medium bodied, mild carbonation. Robust and flavorful.  Quite traditional in style and well done.\n",
      "Great stout, easy to drink. A little light in the taste compared to other stouts\n",

First tastes that come through are pleasant coffee and then a nice wave of bourbon comes through before finishing with semi-sweet chocolate. The ending hop presence is a nice addition and gives it some dry bitterness (in a good way). Very smooth given the ABV.\n",

      "Pours crystal clear straw with champagne carbonation. Huge seafoam head that relaxes quickly. Sweet malt aroma. Light malt taste with a watery mouthfeel. Clean malt floow-through with a medium bitter hops aftertaste. Very dizzy and easygoing.\n",
      "Cerveza oscura, sabor maltoso dulce  ,recuerda a miel ,melaza \n",
      "Me recuerda a paulaner salvatore no igual\n",
      "Po nalaniu piwo obficie się pieni. Po krótkim czasie zauważalny jest też wyraźny i długo utrzymujący się lacing. Zapach słodki i lekko cytrusowy. W smaku czujemy delikatną goryczkę, którą tak jak i w przypadku zapachu niweluję słodkość (bananowa jak na ten gatunek przystało) i delikatnie cytrusy. Goździki bardzo słabo wyczuwalne, ale jednak na drugim, lub raczej trzecim planie gdzieś tam są. Dosyć mocno nasycone. Bardzo dobry weizen.\n",
      "The one I'm drinking has been brewed in Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orange hazy with a frothy head.\n",
      "Smell of passion fruit, peach and grapefruit with a grainy, milky note, but also this funky rotten fruit note present in some beers of the bigger IPA family. In taste this funky fruit note is even stronger.\n",
      "Not my kind of beer.\n",
      "Piwo klarowne, brązowa, wręcz rubinowa barwa, a do tego ładna czapa piany. Dąb, co prawda obecny, ale jednak Schelnkerla to Schelnkerla. Bucha wędzoną kiełbasą, bekonem, ogniskiem. Trochę słodu karmelowego, który dodaje nieco słodyczy, kiełbasa, a dalej daje o sobie znać dębina, która pozostawia całkiem intensywny posmak. Ciało średnie, absolutnie bez uczucia pustki. Alkohol w zasadzie niewyczuwalny. Bardzo solidna wędzonka\n",
      "Lekki gushing przy otwieraniu. Piana niewielka, barwa mahoniowa, zamglona. W aromacie przyjemna wanilina, przypalony karmel, melasa, rodzynki, trochę kokosa i migdałów. W smaku dość słodkie, sporo tu słonego karmelu, ciemnego miodu, daktyli, dużo wanilii, migdałów, orzechów włoskich, nut porto... Goryczka nieduża, tytoniowa, wysycenie niskie, lekko burbonowy finisz, gęste, oleiste i wyklejające w odbiorze.\n",

      "Mistrzostwo w kategorii BW BBA - deserowe, przyjemnie słodowe, kojarzące się z Pedro Ximenezem, z wyraźnym barrel ageingiem i potężnym body. Klasa!\n",

      "Hazy yellow, very thin, frothy, white head. Aroma of dank peach, pineapple, lychee, pine, onion, lime. Taste has sweetish peach & pineapple, ripe lychee, dank onion with bitter accents of stonefruit & pine. Dryish, floral hoppy finish, more dank yellow fruit. Medium body, oily texture, fizzy carbonation. Dank stuff but subtle all in all.\n",
      "Color naranja, muy turbia, translúcida, casi opaca. Espuma blanca, ligeramente jabonosa, de más de un dedo de espesor y corta retención. Aroma tropical, melocotón y mango maduro, muy maduro, albaricoque y leve hierba. Sabor tropical como en aroma aunque más cercano a la acidez, hierba, piña verde y mucho pomelo y resina, final medio, de amargor cítrico y resinoso, notas alcohólicas. Textura casi sedosa. Carbonatación media aunque chispeante.\n",

      "Deep dark brown coloured body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall off-white head that fades fairly quickly. Aroma of deep bourbon, alcohol, cognac, caramelised sugars, nuts, coffee, earth, lactose and a bunch of anise/licorice - very deep and robust. Medium to barely Full-bodied; Strong rich malt notes that shows the roasted malt, a bunch of coffee and earth with a touch of peanuts and cashew flavours show through with a lot of alcohol and boozy qualities and a rich sweetness finishes it off nicely. Aftertaste shows the deep cognac and scotch notes with a lot of alcohol pungency, but the earth, coffee, lactose and cream notes somehow shine through even stronger, with a lot of anise and licorice bitterness still around and some softer sugars at the tail end make this somewhat balanced, but still strong, and perhaps a touch thin. Overall, a rich and earthy beer with a ton of boozy warmth throughout with a lot of the cognac and whiskey notes that can't be hidden, but the anise and fennel flavours are strong as well, and the two years haven't tempered it or made it mellow, and this is quite strong and pungent throughout. Overall, a deeper and more pungent beer than I expected, especially after a few years in the bottle, with a deep robust punch from the malt and alcohol with a lot of boozy flaovurs and anise notes with a touch of vanilla. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 28-December-2017 for US$4,49 sampled at home in Washington, just over two years later on 27-January-2020.\n",
      "Aroma has a distinctive sharp pine smell. Taste is a hit of pine bitter, a little orange sweetness. Texture is crisp.\n",
      "Clear, pale gold pour with a clear one finger head. Aroma of nice cereal, toast, spicy hops, a little herbal, and nice grainy notes. Flavor is nice, full flavor cereal, toast, light grain oil,  spicy, floral and floral hops, nice bready notes and a hint of minerality. Light body, smooth feel throughout, light carbonation. Easily one of the best pale lagers I've ever had, clean flavorful and refreshing.\n",
      "a bit of lemony hops. their most popular beer. on tap at the source. a bit difgerent snd 100 ibu.\n",
      "Pours black with sparse tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves ample lacing; tobacco and dark chocolate on the nose; rich, syrupy palate. I recognize it’s a superb brew but it’s a bit too cloying and rich for me.\n",
      "competent serviceable stout. a bit thin and sweet for a fes. on tap at the source.\n",
      "12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy amber with a dense lasting white head. Malty aroma. Coppery hops up front with a nice balancing malt sweet in the lead up to the bitter finish. Very clean mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Happy anniversary.\n",
      "from a 473ml can on 28/1/2020. Pours a clearish medium golden with a small head. The nose is light with a bit of fruit and piney hops. Flavour wise, there's a modest caramel malt background with some stone fruit (apricot, peach), followed by a sustained, extremely bitterness, which is herbal, piney, resiny, lingering and tongue coating.The bitterness is actually a bit too much, overwhelming the initial flavours. The mouthfeel is slick, the carbonation average. Big and flavoursome but a touch unbalanced for mine.\n",

Medium to abundant body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy juicy bittersweet flavor with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. This beer met my expectations.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle via trade. Thanks again, Nick! 2018 vintage. Pours a clear amber, kind of on the darker end of the spectrum, with a small off-white head that settles into a ring and very small spotty island of film. Notes of brown sugar, caramel and toasted malts, raisins, dates, figs, tea, earth, and a bit of spice. Fruitcake might be my one-word description. Medium-full bodied, with modest carbonation and a big, sweet, malty mouthfeel. Big and rich. Good winter beer.\n",

      "Slightly hazy deep golden with a thin rocky white head. Lovely dank sticky hop aroma featuring earthy floral hops and a little pine and a firm slightly biscuity malt backbone. Big flavor that’s malty and slightly biscuity and grainy with a bitter piney classic ‘00s touch with A floral resinous Finish. Crisp and full and has some American hoppy nuance but refrains from being overly bitter or oily or too dank.\n",
      "Pours a clear dark yellow with a foamy white head. Hoppy aroma with hints of pine. Crisp and clean with a piney citrus flavor and a light malty sweetness with very little bitterness. Full mouth freshness finishing with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. Refreshing and enjoyable.\n",
      "500 ml bottle. Pours oily black with a medium light brown head. Unfiltered, with lots of brown sediment on bottom of glass. Aroma of milk chocolate, French toast, maple syrup,  coffee and cinnamon. Taste of French Toast, milk chocolate, maple syrup, coffee and cinnamon.\n",
      "De Beer Republic. En copa Teku. Viendo Sex Education 2x03-04. Suaves notas cafetosas. Aunque esta bastante bien, no llega a impresionar en ningun aspecto. Ni tan lechosa ni tan cremosa como imaginaba. Termina pasando desapercibida\n",

A big caramel and biscuit malt backbone, sweet citrus fruit, and a very firm pine/resin bitterness. Full bodied with moderate bitterness. Had their DIPA yesterday, which was really good. This is arguably even better. A terrific flavoursome, beautifully balanced IPA.\n",

      "12 oz bottle found at the local Publix. Nice grapefruit aroma with a hint of sweetness to it. Light amber in color with a light haze. Nicely balanced, with the hop bitterness coming slightly ahead of the background sweet malt flavors. Tastes of bitter resinous pine with a fleeting hint of malt sweetness in the background. Nice medium mouthfeel with a slightly bitter finish. Too bad this is a limited edition!\n",

      "Tap at bowsers, thot I did this one already. A darker brew. Smells like some kind of sweet cinnamon cookies. Taste is flat and bitter with too much of that holiday spice thing going on, comes across as quite rude on the palate. Not good, just too much spices. Seems more like a medicine. Difficult to finish. Good example of a poorly made holiday brew, whew.\n",

      "Clear golden, lasting, thin, white head. Aroma of grass, apple peel, unripe pear, herbs, yeast. Taste has sweetish apple & pear, quite bready & yeasty, subtle sour accent; bitter, grassy hoppy finish, bit yeasty & fruity. Medium body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. Assertive bitter Helles.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 4.8%. Medium pretty short-lasting head. Mostly-clear gold. Sweetcorn aroma. Moderate carbonation. Some sweetcorn flavour, but more prominent honeyed notes on a robust white bready malt. Nice, authentic-tasting Helles. Cloudwater can pat themselves on the back for this one, and I found it pleasant enough considering I'm rather fussy about the style.\n",
      "Bottle. Clear golden color. Small size, white head, stays. Sour, sweet, brett, woody, dry hops in aroma/taste. Drinkable brew.\n",
      "one of the pioneers in beer world. i cannot imagine any other beer with this much smokey aroma and taste\n",
      "De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En almuerzo, cumple de asun hija (9 años) Con bacalao dorado de calamocha + filetes de pollo. Version de 2019. Sobresaliente aun con unos meses encima. Herbal, resinosa y acaramelada, de una manera suave pero asertiva. Deja con ganas de mas\n",
      "Keg at the 2020 Manchester Beer Festival. Black pour with a light tan head. Dark chocolate, coconut and sweet tobacco aroma. Lots of liquorice in the taste,more sweet tobacco,cocoa. Rich,sweet warming finish.\n",
      "47,3cl Can @ Mikkeller Webshop, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n",
      "Hazy golden colour with a thin white head.\n",
      "Aroma is hops, citrus, tropical fruits.\n",
      "Taste is hops, citrus, mango, pineapple.\n",
      "Medium body, average carbonation.\n",
      "Bottle, 0.50l. Aroma of smoked ham, leather, roasted malt and wood. Pours clear dark amber brown color with medium sized creamy tan-like head and average sparkling appearance. Taste starts with medium sweet roasted and smoked malt and caramel, following is leathery, earthy and grassy, mouthfeel is smooth while finish is medium bitter. Medium body, oily texture and average carbonation in palate. Smoke & fly...\n",
      "Deep, dark brown color with a tan head.  Deep roasted malt, dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee flavors, with just enough malt sweetness and a pretty strong hops bitterness for a stout.  Malpais Stout almost reminds me of a cross between a stout and a porter.  Excellent and very easy drinking.\n",
      "Es divertida tomarla. Son sabores y aromas diferentes mezclados haciendo que cada sorbo le encuentres algo diferente al paladar.\n",
      "No tomaría más de 2 en una misma noche lol. Chills!!\n",
      "El primer encuentro con el sentido del olfato es agradable aún cuando logras percibir la fragancia al alcohol. Una vez en boca te conecta con sabores a café, chocolate y en mi opinión tiene un sabor a madera ahumada. El color y el cuerpo de la misma son los tradicionales en una cerveza oscura. El último sorbo se siente más amargo y más tibio en el paladar. Recomiendo disfrutarla sola sin ningún acompañamiento de comida y a temperatura de 11°C. Chills!!!\n",
      "On tap. Pours a deep orange mahogany with little head. Aromas of forest berries, forest floor and dull wheaty malts. Flavors of sharp forest berries, spruce, lemons and sharp wheaty malts\n",
      "Taster on Weathered. \n",
      "Appearance: hazy deep golden with no head.\n",
      "Aroma: moderately sweet grapes, some wild character, some barrels and honey.\n",
      "Taste: along the same lines, pretty acidic, though.\n",
      "Overall: a bit too acidic for me, but it has a nice character.\n",
      "12 oz can to tulip. Aroma of orange, fig, pineapple, light caramel malt. Taste of same with lemon-lime-grapefruit citrus. Sadly disappointed from the hype.\n",
      "Deep black, thick pour. Tan foam crown. Smoky, sweet nose. Emergence of big bourbon notes. Molasses, maple syrup, anise, pepper, dark roast coffee come to mind. First sip is cloying sweetness, followed by undisguised alcohol burn and then culminating in a potent bourbon finish. Some coffee grinds and maple flavors. At over 11% this beer retains a lot of nice flavor and locks in a tasty balance of sweetness and booziness. Unfortunately the alcohol content is not well concealed. Nonetheless, this one is well worth picking up if you see it out in the wild.\n",

      "12oz bottle (4/11/18 if I'm reading it correctly) - I've had this before at Dark Lord Day thanks to AndyReynolds but failed to rate it, until now. Nose is plums or black licorice. Sip adds doublebock elements: sweet, strong and more sweet.  boozy.  Roast finish.  ABV dangerously well hidden\n",

      "\n",
      "Very tasty! Drinks like a red wine, really elegant and complex, with diverse fruit notes and leathery wine barrel notes. The finish is really amazing, there is so much going on even minutes after the last sip. Beautiful Belgian classic, worth its reputation. Score: 8 / 4 / 8 / 5 / 17\n",

      "\"Ettaler Curator\", 7 %, Fläschchen von der Grünen Woche, Berlin. - Tiefdunkles Kupfergoldbraun, klar. - In der Nase vornehmes, tiefes dunkles Malz mit zurückhaltenden Noten von Kakao, Rosinen, Karamel und Weinbrand, sehr rund. - Antrunk reich und schwer dunkelmalzig mit feiner Röstigkeit, Mokka, Melanoidinen, gebranntem Zucker, dunkler Frucht. Zarte ranzige Note, die sich mit der Zeit verliert. Milder rezent, vollmundig aber nicht so schwer wie viele; perfekt kaschierter Alkohol.

Hops in background, clean in terms of yeast. Lots of cocoa, chocolate. Rich, intense, at least relatively considering the rather low alcohol. Very good.\n",

Bourbon and coconut nose with chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, still plenty of coconut flavor for a 4-yr old (the re-infusion talking), still plenty of habanero.

Taste is more bitter than anticipated from a sweet stout. Vanilla and bitter dark chocolate. Little bit of an alcohol presence that takes over mid-sip. Smooth but rather thin mouthfeel. I wanted a bit more from this one but I do enjoy it. More-loko.\n",

It has a medium body with a moderately tart aftertaste. Overall, it is favorable and tart.\n",
      "On tap at Fortnight in downtown Providence, RI.  Dark root-beer brown, bright/clear at the edges, medium-light brown, medium-fine head, moderate-fast rate of decay.  Aroma is some milk chocolate with big berry fruit: some cherry, candy grape, some raspberry and blackberry.  blackcurrant.  pumpernickel bread, leather, touch of Worcestershire sauce, some vanilla and caramel (nice brandy-oak!).  Body is medium-heavy, oily, medium-light, medium-fat carbonation, little burn.  Flavor is slightly tart berry (blackberry, bit of cherry and black currant) chocolate bread... bit of vanilla and hint of toasted oak.   *NOTE* I can't help but wonder if this keg is a bit unstable.  This beer is definitely slightly tart.  I'm not seeing much note of this in the reviews.  I hope we got an accurate representation.  It definitely comes off lighter than expected, and I wouldn't describe it as chewy :/\n",

      "The cheapest can in BrewDog Tower Hill - £4 compared to a £19 pastry stout. Spicy grainy marmalade aroma. Hazy light-medium brown. Frothy creamy off-white head. Initial bitterness smooths out into marmalade sweetness. Rye spice throughout. After the first couple of sips the booziness becomes evident. Light-medium bodied. Slick. Flat carbonation other than an afterthought of bubbles into the finish. Long slightly astringent finish. I like a marmalade-esque beer. Good stuff.\n",

      "Deep brown/black pour, thumb sized head that eventually faded to a small ring, no lace.  Aroma of anise, light molasses, whiskey, very slight vinous notes.  A little more red wine coming through as this warms up, whiskey, anise, faint maple and dark chocolate notes, lighter smoke.  Medium body, finishes slightly smoky and sweet.\n",
      "Can from Systembolaget. Pours a golden colour beer with a medium head. Fruity and hoppy with notes of tropical fruits, citrus, caramel and pine. Dry finish.\n",
      "0,33 bottle. Világos, átlátszó, valódi aranysárga szín, kehelyben hatalmas fehér habbal. Viszonylag visszafogott illat, komlós, gyantás, picit citrusos, alkohol teljesen elbújtatva. Nagyon durván komplex, testes, de nagyon finom, és jól iható triple. Érdemes egy-egy kortyonként inni. Minden kortynál kijön valamilyen íz. Édes-pezsgő-szőlő, vagy komlós keserű, vagy édes, mézes, aszalt gyümölcsös, vagy narancshéj. Ez nem vicc, tényleg. Nagyon jó a szénsavassága is. Most már lassan kóstoltam az alap trappista triple-belga söröket, de számomra eddig ez a legjobb!\n",
      "Can. Dark chocolate, roast, smooth with a dry finish. Apricot, green banana, starfruit. Light forest berries in the background. Very tasty.\n",
      "Bottle. White oak, vanilla, coconut, port wine, dark fruit, light spicy oak, light roast, subtle coffee. Oaky and creamy finish. Very complex, huge flavour depth. Outstanding.\n",
      "Draught. Strong resin, citrus, light tropical fruit. ersistent yellow grainy notes reminiscent of corn. Disappointing.\n",
      "Bottle. Lime, white grapes, grapefruit, popcorn, passion fruit. Minor grainy notes, spicy finish. Very good.\n",
      "Bottle. Chocolate, citrus, light resin, full, smooth and creamy, light tart bitter finish. Superb!\n",
      "Draught. Amazingly juicy citrus fruit throughout. Amazingly clean taste, superb balance, hoppy to the core yet without a trace of hop burn. Shows that a simple beer can be mindblowing. Could drink this everyday.\n",
      "Draught. Juicy citrus, gasoline, mineral finish, quite heavyish reception, not crisp enough. Disappointing.\n",
      "Draught. MAngo, peach, pineapple, citrus, excellent balance. Unfortunately some minor yeast funk detected, hence \"merely\" a very good beer.\n",
      "Bottle. Citrus, lime, pine, herbal, eau de Cologne, amazing sweet-bitter balance, superb drinkability. Excellent.\n",
      "Bottle. Kiwi, pear, white grapes, green jelly, spicy notes (curry?). Balanced, soft and original. Superb.\n",
      "Bottle. Citrus, grapefruit, hint of mango, amazing sweet-bitter balance, soft and moreish. Superb!\n",
      "Bottle. Lemon, grapefruit, light yellow fruit, light resin, a herbal hint. Not as intense as expected though very tasty.\n",

      "Certainement parmi mes bières préférées.  Une belle carbonatation soutenue par une mousse dense et onctueuse.\n",
      "On tap at Ayinger am Platzl with some Wildschwein Pflanzerl. Dark brown with decent fine head. Roasty nose with dark caramel hints. Flavor is fantastic with caramel and lightly-bitter toasty grains, not overly sweet, good smooth hop bitter finish. Classic example of style.\n",
      "Deep copper with a white head. Toasted malts, light noble hops, earth, cereal, some sweetness tucked in the background. Always a huge fan of Heater Allen- amazed this made it to Guam.\n",
      "Pours a dark golden color with a very thick off white head. The aroma is pine, citrus, and brown bread crust. The flavor is caramel, brown bread crust, some pine but not overly done, and some juicy citrus mixed in there as well. The mouthfeel is on the light to medium and drink ability is quite high. Solid beer from Sierra Nevada as always.\n",
      "Bottle from Whole Foods Market Blossom Hill in San Jose, CA. Aroma is spicy yeast, fruity, some spiced bread. Taste is yeasty, crisp and soft carb, bready, fruity. Classic and straightforward but not especially memorable.\n",
      "Can pour from Colonial Spirits, Acton. Appearance is clear, ruby red with nice sparkle, ephemeral fizzy cap of light brown head with no lacing. Aroma is toffee, fig, brown sugar, toast. Taste is strong fig, caramel, toast. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth texture, average, frothy carbonation and finish as taste. Overall, strong aroma and flavor with decent complexity. Worthy of its Top 50 status.\n",
      "16 oz can from Brewers Haven. Clear golden body with a lasting tight head. Aroma is grainy, bready. Taste follows with robust malty, grainy flavors. Fairly thick body too. Really tasty.\n",
      "7 year aged bottle to glass, thanks TJ!\n",
      "Moderate aroma of coffee and dark fruit, alcohol.  Dark brown w tan head, foamy. Legs. Flavor is roast coffee with some dark chocolate cherry. Slightly hints of smoke.  Alcohol and earthiness.  Thick body w some creaminess, low to moderate carb, warming. Worth it.\n",
      "12 oz can, pours purple red clear with light pink head.  Medium body.  Tart berry aroma, with sour blueberry front and center in the taste.  Sweet fruity finish.  Excellent.\n",
      "Draft at Strangeloves. Nearly clear gold pour with a slim layer of white foam. Fragrant aroma. A complex meaty mix of woody florals and citrus pith. Nice effervescent notes. Tangerine peels. Burnished wood. Fainter mango, leather, tobacco, and ghee. Wonderfully complicated! Nice mix. Would recommend.\n",
      "From a 12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear copper with an off white head.  Aromas of pineapple  and dank hay. Flavors are bitter citrus and pine.\n",
      "Subtle hits of orange and clove aromas. Mild bready malt. Mild flavors but balanced and refreshing.\n",
      "Color marrón oscuro turbio con espuma fina beige-marrón de retención media y residuo escaso. Aroma a maltas caramelizadas, caramelo, cacao y levadura con notas a frutos secos, madera, frutas de hueso oscuras, ligero clavo y otras especias. Sabor a cacao en polvo, pan integral tostado, caramelo y frutas oscuras maduras con notas a vainilla, clavo, madera, frutos secos y levadura. Dulzor maltoso medio, amargor terroso medio, alcohol medio-alto y regusto largo. Textura acuosa, cuerpo medio y carbonatación medio-alta. Una English Strong Ale trapista muy compleja que comienza con sabor a pan tostado, pasando por frutas maduras y un final especiado y amargo. Muy buena.\n",
      "Pours cloudy maize with an organized white head that settles to a half-finger. Aroma is bready malts and yeast-funk. A touch of clove with warming. Taste brings more clove, Belgian yeast esters, lemon. Mild bitterness. Very active mouthfeel. Well-balanced. Pitch-perfect trippel.\n",
      "16-ounce can finally settles into a black color with ruby highlights and a 1\" thick super creamy tan head and lots of residual lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate. Flavor: milk chocolate, coffee with cream, figs, dates, campfire marshallows, burnt wood. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied with a very creamy finish.\n",

      "Flaska från SB. En brunröd öl med ett lättare smutsvitt skum. Doft och smak av karamell, trä, vanilj, torkad frukt, choklad, lättare kryddighet och en avslutande alkoholsötma.\n",
      "Label im Stil eines Kupferstichs. Schwarz-Braun mit stouttypisch dichtem braunem Schaum. Geruch: unerwartet wenig Süße, voluminöse runde Röstmalzaromen. Geschmack: Auch hier weniger Süße als bei den meisten Stouts. Ein sehr rundes und leckeres Stout.\n",
      "Can, ENORMOUS thanks to wchesser for a fresh can (less than a month old!) flown from the States! Murky orange body, fairly lasting small off white head. Wow. Pleasant, pefumey fruity notes in the aroma, passionfruit, melon, tangerine, light light oaty touch. So damn fresh! Smooth taste initially, tangerine on soft maltiness, but then the surprisingly big, grapeseed bitterness kicks in too. Initially a bit rough, after a few sips it mellows out, turning this into a delight. An excellent juicy IPA by all means, a joy to try.\n",
      "From can (BB Aug'20) in English pint. Pours murky brown w/1-finger frothy tan head, mild choc aroma dialed down from other collabs. Creamy & delish, a touch of spicy bitterness provides some balance\n",
      "Can at home bought from mikkeller's website. This was such a good beer. Its hazy, fruit, smooth, tropical fruits, and bloody beautiful beer\n",
      "Amber with a long lasting off white head. Aroma of bread and caramel. Wonderful complex of malt flavours: toffee, caramel, and tobacco among them but not too sweet. Excellent.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/3/2019. Pours slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit dough, toast, light caramel, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit dough, toast, light caramel, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, biscuit dough, toast, light caramel, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/resinous/drying finish; Nicely soft and not overly aggressive. Awesome Centennial, Cascade profile. Very vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized oat/dark/bready malt backbone. Mild residual sweetness with lingering crisp resin dryness. A really enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on classic tasting west coast style example as expected. Very similar to Celebration, but with a bit less of a rich malt backbone.\n",
      "750ml bottle pours out golden topped with a white fizzy head. Nose has a lot going on citrus notes spice oak barrel. Taste is more of the nice complex notes wood citrus notes spice.\n",
      "16oz can pours out thick hazy golden topped with a white head. Nose is great big juicy tropical fruit hops nice and sweet. Taste is more of the nice sweet juice tropical fruit hops wow great.\n",

      "Acheté à la SAQ du centre ville de St-Hyacinthe. La bière est blonde un peu trouble avec un col fin et persistant. Au nez, je retrouve des odeurs de bananes. En bouche c’est très sucré et peu amer. On croirais une triple belge avec des notes de banane. C’est très agréable et très savoureux.\n",
      "Keg at The Red Hand, Dalston.  A very nice deep golden colour.  Smokey aroma with big woody notes. Big carbonation on the tongue.  But I was won out by the smokiness.\n",
      "Can from BBC Tescos, Reading. Brown-black with a yellow-tan. Nice frothy fizz and a rich mouthfeel. Starts off well with lots of chocolate and some black coffee. A hint of blackcurrant is also encouraging. But the finish is just to burnt and bitter for my tastes; acrid burnt malt, coffee grounds and a touch of plastic. Not for me this one.\n",

Taste and palate: full body but thin feeling, liquoreux, medium sweetness, lots of chocolate and caramel, light acidity and alcool burning finish. Overall: damn good. The nose and mouthfeel of this one is amazing. Not too sure where I could take away points on this bet tbh. Maybe appearance I guess? Excellent!\n",

Pretty faint biscuit, loads of citrus, some pine and herbal notes coming through at the firmly bitter finish which is pleasingly dry. It's tasty but rather straightforward for its strength.

Bottom of the can says it was \"packaged\" on 9/30/19. I'm using my chilled-off Buffalo Bayou snifter to make the sampling, I see a clear, orangey, mostly yellow liquid with a nice snow white head.  The smell is pine and citrus, no surprise for this.  And the drink, firmly hoppy and bitter starting, pine needles and just a hint of grapefruit.  Too bad, I would have appreciated more.  Crisp, refreshing. A decidedly West Coast IPA and that is not bad.\n",

      "Shared 2018, 16.9 oz. bottle poured to a snifter showing a clear, deep burgundy hue, with a bubbly layer of off white froth, and spots of lacing. The nose was funk, grape & cherry, with a pleasant interplay between  lemony tartness, and a touch of sweetness. Medium bodied, with good spritz to the effervescence, the taste was similar, added noticeable bourbon & barrel hints.\n",

APPEARANCE: amber color and cristal clear. medium beige head, creamy with average retention. leg formation. TASTE: initial medium bourbon flavor, followed by medium-low dried grapes, dried figs, slight wood and Maillard compounds (bread crust). Malt presence with a slight caramel character. slight vinous note, Port-like. low bitterness with a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-high to high body with medium carbonation. smooth texture and smooth alcoholic warmth. OVERALL: although the best before date has already passed, this is a very good Old Ale with added fermentables. very complex.\n",

Illata mazsolás, konyakos, fűszeres, kiemelkedő! Sokáig lehetne még az illat összetevőkről írni. de tényleg. Szénsavasság eltalálva, pont jó. Picit cukros-édes, de mellette kesernyés, fanyar, mégis aszalt gyümölcsös is, egyszóval komplex. Egy ugyanilyen hírű trappista dubbel után teszteltem azonnal, és ez klasszisokkal jobb!

Sweetish-malty, gently fruity aroma of molasses, raisins, strawberry jam and some orange peel. Quite sweet, malty, moderately bitter, gently fruity taste of molasses, strawberry jam, raisins and a touch of orange peel, followed by a medium long, moderately bitter, a little boozy finish. Medium to full body, smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel, average carbonation. Well-balanced and moreish as always, quite delicate. I believe I never tried one of the Vintage Ales fresher as this one, and there is still a bit of alcohol detectable, different to the other versions I tried. Should have kept it for another year maybe.\n",

A bunch going on in the nose.  The taste is big Bourbon, oak barrel, wood, syrup sweet toffee, roast and more alcohol heat to the finish.  As with the aroma a bunch going on the taste.  The flavors integrate much better as the beer approaches room temperature.  The palate is heavy to medium bodied, with soft carbonation and the dry, roast warming finish.\n",

      "Аромат очень кислый и сложный. Ощущаются прежде всего овощи вроде томатов и сельдерея. Есть ассоциации на сухофрукты с намеками на мед, также сено и квашенные яблочки, в целом что то между Фландрийским и ламбиком. Цвет полу мутный, желтый, пены почти нету. Вкус такой же сложный как аромат. Сразу ощущаются нотки яблок с яблочной ноткой от дрожжей. Немного ягод, прежде всего от красной смородины. При глотке хмелевая сухость а также сильная лимонаня кислота, которая плавно перетекает в яблочки. Снова есть доля от сухофруктов а также специй, напоминает гвоздику и также перец. Алкоголь не ощущается вообще. В целом вообще очень благородное пиво, очень сложное, которое сложно пить часто, но опыт приятен.\n",

Bready malt with a touch of caramel sweetness.  Medium, soft carbonation, medium body with a slick texture.  Mildly bitter finish.  Very enjoyable.\n",

      "Can from brewery.  moderate-lightly cloudy apricot juice, with an inch of white head, medium-fine, medium-good retention.  Aroma is some dank  big mango (ripe), some onion top, pineapple, bit of melon (cantaloupe) - not as much as I've previously had w/ Nelson, touch of passion fruit, and it's hard to discern the white wine grape underneath these dank tropical fruits.  Bit of red berry.  Body is medium-weight, starchy (textured) and oily, moderate-moderate-light carbonation, and burn.  medium-coarse bubbles.  Flavor is some dried mango, bit of orange, some cantaloupe, touch of dank herb, hint of chalk, blackberry.  Some bitter grass with a hint of sap on the finish.  Really cool IPA!  Texture is not quite as cool as other HF IPA's I'm having here, though.\n",

      "Not a bad triple. Yeasty esters, a touch of tangerine, surgery malts, a touch of bitterness. It'll do.\n",
      "Bottle 0.75l. Clear, dark red to brown colored. AROMA- dark fruit and jam, dates, chocolate, apple. FLAVOR- quite smooth, neutral, moderately bitter, chocolate, toffee, touch of fruit and jam, cocoa powder, prunes. Medium bodied. \n",
      "Not bad.\n",
      "Fresh growler from the brewery.  Very hazy yellow with a bit of orange mustard, huge plume I’d cram colored head.  Aroma is very chalky semi dank onion, not as much supporting fruit.  Unripe mango.  Body is med heavy, syrupy, sonewhat oily, med carb, frothy, semi creamy, flavor is almost sour herbs, dried mango, papaya, but if guava, some onion (wet, less sharp) hint of rock candy, mod bitter.\n",
      "Can from brewery, consumed same day as I bought it.  Bright golden yellow, chewy lightly lager-tart corn and toasted corn syrup, grass and sweet hay, light blueberry. Body is med-light weight somewhat starchy, bit syrupy and oily, mod carbonation, med-light burn, semi-creamy,  flavor is hay and light corn , bit of corn syrup, touch of bitter grass, clean, light lingering clean bitterness.  Great lager!\n",
      "Growler from the Brewery.  Very cloudy creamsicle with frothy white head.  Medium-good retention.  Aroma is some orange and dank onion, bit of gunpowder, chalk, bit of dried banana and pineapple.  Body is medium weight, oily- but starchy and soft.  Silky mouthfeel. Flavor is grapefruit, unrobe orange, onion tops, bit of grass and very low bitterness, hint of bubble gum.  Hint of keffir lime leaf. Very good - defines itself w it’s mouthfeel and maybe that bit if gunpowder in the aroma.  Still, hard to believe it’s worth the hype.\n",
      "Light copper-amber, long lasting pillowy head. Aroma citrus and light biscuit. Taste citrus, woody pine, supported by a subtle malt base. The malt really effects the palate providing great body along with a subtle contrasting sweet and roasted grain finish. Nice balance.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy amber-golden color, fine white head. Intense banana and clove aroma. Medium dry taste, low bitterness. Fruity banana, spicy clove and biscuit malty aftertaste, reminds me of banana bread. High carbonation, full body.\n",

      "Can 0.44l at Malt Attacks, Brussels, Belgium. 17.01.2020. Pour it hazy orange color with small white head. Aroma nice mango, apricot and peach notes. Taste smooth easy drinkable, mango, passion fruit, light floral, really nice balanced.\n",
      "Rich port wine like aroma with some chocolate, butterscotch and heavy oak. Very pretty dark ruby color with no head. Hot up front, followed by sweeter notes from the aroma, finishing with oak and more heat. This bottle is over 18 months old, so it really packs a punch. Nice full palate. Very well blended, very well balanced. Great.\n",
      "De couleur cuivre on n’a des notes herbacés tropicaux  .en bouche on na quand une bonne amertume avec le goût du pin et des tangerine\n",
      "Buona doppelbock un pochino troppo dolce per i miei gusti, certo, dopo aver assaggiato la celebrator le altre non mi soddisfano mai\n",
      "Draft to taster at Pies & Pints. Looks good for the style; a transparent golden orange with eggshell head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells of piney, bitter, and citrusy hops alongside a moderately bittersweet backbone. Tastes like it smells with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Good, not great.\n",
      "Can from Real Ale in Richmond. Red-brown pour with frothy head. Earthy hops, pleasant bitterness with some caramel in finish.\n",
      "Bottle shared at BD Castlegate. It pours clearish orangey with minimal head. The aroma is sweet, sticky, sugary, apricot, peach, persimmon, jammy, tinned fruits and candy.

Just under medium body, just under average carbonation. Bit foamy mouthfeel. The smoke gives this Helles a nice extra dimension. Nice one.\n",

The taste is firmly dry, nutty, toasty grain, cereal, hay, spicy, woody, farmhouse style bread loaf and some metallic twang. Finish is dry and toasted cereal. Medium body and high, lively carbonation. Pleasnat and quaffable. A fine example of the style.\n",

      "Aromas of fudge, tree bark, brownie batter, charred malts, licorice and star anise. Taste is heavily charred, campfire ash, tree bark, cigar smoke, fudge, chocolate, brownie batter, molasses, roasted barley, roasted malts, licorice and toffee. Overall, an excellent representation of the style. Very dark and fudgy.\n",
      "Pours a reddish brown.  Two finger white head, good retention and light lacing. Clear.  Pretty beer. Aroma is toasty malt.  Nutty.  Dark cherry. Taste is moderately sweet.  Light dark cherry.  Sort of a NyQuil cherry alcohol taste.    Toasty malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied.  Chewy.  Easy drinking.  I’m sipping and drunk it in no time. Overall it’s quite good.  It’s tasty.  I’d recommend it and I would buy it again.\n",
      "Hazy with a white head. Aroma of tropical fruit, mango, citrus, pineapple, dank. Medium bodied, moderate bitterness, citrus and tropical fruit dominate. Despite being hazy colored, this is more of a West Coast/Pacific Rim style IIPA. Nice.\n",
      "Bottle shared by Dan at Rock Elm in Plymouth, MN. Thanks! This was terrific. Dark, thick, rich, bold wood character. Booze character but not boozy, despite the high ABV. Fantastic.\n",

      "Loving this West Coast IPA and missing that it isn't around as much anymore with all this NEIPA craze. This one's a solid one, with big grapefruit and peel. Pours orange with decent head. Bitter finish. Wish it was super fresh, but this I'll still take. Nice malt backbone. Bottle.\n",

      "Pint can from BrewDog Doghouse. Clear orange amber, not much head. Orange malt aroma. Tangerine hop falvour. Sharp and better. Decent IPA but doesn't deserve quite such high ratings.\n",

      "\n",
      "PKGD 12/16/19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy, golden-amber body with a medium-small, whitish head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smell: A little caramel and honey-brushed biscuit, subtly bready with restrained citrus, florals, pine and black peppercorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste: Modestly sweet, bready and biscuity with a light flourish of honey, blonde caramel. Citusy, light pine. Peppery, a teensy bit earthy, some rustic woodsiness. Citrus quality picks up a little lime on the tailend, particularly as it warmed. Medium bitterness. A final lick of orange blossom honey before the gently drying finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp yet displays a scant oily texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: 40th feels like a beer someone would've tried to slap the Extra Pale Ale moniker onto. Nothing too terribly groundbreaking or over-the-top whimsical. I, myself will be turning forty this year and neither need nor expect much fanfare or ribaldry, content to just keep sailing along.\n",

      "Smooth, slightly sour, we’ll balanced carbonization/mouth feel. Hint of sting you alcohol characteristic of “bock” in the end. Great beer.\n",
      "Keg at Barley Pop, 1.18.20. Clear red. Aroma of muts, jammy cherry, pepper, honey. Taste is honey, grape jam, honey, nuts, vanilla, pepper. Medium bodied, hints of booze. Decent. But if all their meads are this quality they are way overrated.\n",

      "50 cl bottle bought from Carrefour. Pours hazy dark brown color with small beige head. Aroma of caramel, dried fruits, roasted malt, coffee, brown sugar. Taste of roasted malt, caramel, coffee, brown bread, brown sugar. Medium body, lively carbonation, medium dry finish. Overall a very good bock beer.\n",
      "Piwo koloru ciemno- brazowego, praktycznie zero piany. W aromacie karmel, kawa zbożowa, lekki tost, jabłko (być może od brandy), kokos, rodzynka, nuty brandy. Muszę zaznaczyć, ze ten odbourbonowy kokos bardzo przyjemny. W smaku ciemne owoce, nuty brandy i bourbona. Kokos ponownie się wyróżnia i ponownie jest bardzo przyjemny. Poza tym karmel, lekka wanilia, odrobina ciemnego pieczywa, i praliny, mokre drewno, orzechy. Alkohol bardzo delikatny, likierowy. Ciało w sumie średnie, adekwatne do stylu, wysycenie średnie do niskiego. Nie byłem entuzjastą kanadyjskiego porteru bałtyckiego, ale muszę przyznać, że jest to kawał dobrego piwa. Ten kokos od bourbona po prosru wymiata.\n",

      "Near black, thin beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, coffee and roast malt. Flavours of coffee, prunes, raisins and chocolate. Nice soft but full mouthfeel. Excellent.\n",
      "Växjö chapterhouse fatöl. Färgen är klassiskt modern. Guld halmig medel till full grummel. Doftar JÄTTEFRÄSCHT av mestadels annanas. När jag tar stora klunkar blir jag överraskad av massor blommor och parfym . Oj en Blom , parfym Dipa alltså. Ganska hårt kolsyrad tyvär . Ok Dipa där doften var stora positiva grejen . Nu efter jag klunkat upp så Satans vad parfym det är nu i munnen . Och efter ytterligare en stund efter du svalt känns tyvär bitterhet och ingen direkt smak. Lätt obalanserad Dipa . 3,6 är ju Inge bra betyg för en Dipa. De brukar ju som välgjorda hamna på 4 typ.\n",

      "473ml can. Pours a slightly hazy gold-yellow with a medium, foamy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves thick patches of lace. Sweet fruity aroma of bready caramel malt, pineapple, mango, honeydew, apricot and piney hops. Sweet fruity flavour of biscuit malt, caramel, orange peel, peach, apricot, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, honeydew and piney hops in a dry, spicy yeast finish.

      "An excellent finish to your day with a very nice creamy head that lingers silky smooth well after consumption, and this is what distinguishes the Founders Imperial Stout from it's peers. I've found numerous Imperial Stouts with very nice flavor, but this finish is outstanding. Overall rating 98.\n",
      "Bottle, 2016 vintage. Chocolate malt aroma aroma with notes of allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, bourbon, pumpkin, vanilla and oak. Pours deep caramel brown with a thin tan head that has little retention and some lacing. Starts with chocolate, pumpkin and the aforementioned pumpkin spice flavors as well as having a medium body and smooth mouthfeel.

      "Heard this was the last time they were ever gonna make this old school white whale type brew. I would have killed for this back in the 2012-2013 era. Finally saw it collecting dust in a grocery store so figured, fuck it. Time for a go at the old hag. I poured it into a tulip and chugged the shit out of it. Tasted like liquid ice cream. Great beer. Probably never buy it again, but fuck it YOLO.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink. \n",

      "Less than 16 week old bottle, from Bier Huis, Ossett. Hazed, medium gold. Some fine floaters. Fine ring of white head. Wasn’t having a beer for a week, supposedly, but got a flyer from work, and did this with some crumpets and Alpha Toma cheese. I don’t know sometimes, but words can’t do justice. This is a beer I haven’t had since pre RB days, and I remember it standing out back then as something unique and exciting. It’s just a warming, ridiculously smooth and tasty, bittersweet glass of gorgeousness.\n",
      "Piwo ma ciemnobrunatną barwę, nalewa się z beżową i szybko znikającą pianą.\n",
      "Aromat jest intensywny i złożony. Dużo tutaj pumpernikla, melasy, kawy zbożowej, spieczonych tostów. W tle suszone owoce kandyzowane.\n",
      "W smaku piwo jest pełne i wyraźnie słodkie. Płynny pumpernikiel przejmuje władanie. Dopiero po chwili dochodzą nuty melasy, kawy zbożowej, niuanse spalonej skórki chleba, susz owocowy. Goryczka jest lekko zarysowana, ma raczej palony charakter, a sam finisz jest lekko cierpki i wytrawny. Alkohol jest niewyczuwalny.\n",
      "[Draught at 2 Doors Down, June 5, 2019] Pours a hazy yellow-gold with an average size semi-lasting frothy white head. Some lacing. Nice aroma (7+) with a good amount of hops -- herbal and citrusy -- along with a pleasant Wit aroma. Flavour, also nice (7+), of citrusy hops, wheat, yeast, more fruit and an average bitter finish. Average bodied. I quite enjoyed it.\n",
      "Portland, Maine, poured from a can.  Clean, pure, effervescent sensations from start to finish.  My current favorite afternoon beer.  ABV is 4.6%, about the same as Founder's All-Day IPA, which I would consider to be this beer's cousin in the ale family.  I'm not sure what qualifies this as a pilsner as opposed to a session IPL.  Whatever it is, as a bitter and hoppy lager, I think this is excellent.  It has fruity, juicy front notes and a long citrus-rind finish.\n",
      "2020/01/17 - Pours a hazy bright yellow-honey colour with a thick, foamy, white head that slowly reduces and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is juicy pineapple, mango, peaches, grapefruit, grassy notes, dank hops, biscuit and light onion. Taste is peach, tropical fruits, grapefruit, weedy/grass hops and hints of onion. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with lightly biting carbonation and a sharp finish that is moderately bitter and mildly chalky.\n",
      "I don't know if this is technically a pilsner, but regardless it's my favorite pilsner.  Perfectly balanced and very refreshing.  Exactly what you want from this type of beer.\n",
      "Cerveza con el premio de mejor cerveza del mundo 2011 de tradición alemana de la fábrica cervecera más antigua que existe. Color ámbar, turbia, alcohol muy bien integrado que apenas se nota y bastante espuma blanca con buena retención.\n",
      "Frothy pour from the Sovereign. Sour lemon, pepper,  salt.  refreshing and good.\n",
      "355ml bottle. Pours jet black with a lasting dark tan head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, roasted caramel malts, touch of vanilla, some dark fruits. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel. The dark fruits are more prominent on the taste, especially on the arrival, which then give way to milk chocolate. The finish is a flourish of roasted malts and a coffee bitterness. The bottle describes the beer as \"dark, rich and sexy\" and I can't find any reason to argue with that. A superb porter.\n",
      "Near clear brassy gold.  Spicy floral noble hop aroma and taste, with a crisp sweet grain backbone.  Doesn't rewrite the style, but pretty  3.6+nice.\n",
      "Comme souvent avec Cloudwater, une merveille de réussite! Agréable goût de mangue/mandarine fruité en bouche. Totalement bonne!  👌 🍻\n",
      "bottiglia 650 ml, schiuma beige fine media persistenza, colore ambrato velato, al naso è intensa miele zucchero di canna malto tostato, in bocca malto caramello frutta sciroppata, corpo rotondo, l’alcool si sente ma non disturba, carbonatazione moderata, amaro accentuato lungo nel finale. Ottima decisa equilibrata. Una bottiglia da 650 ml é poca…..! Ricorda le Bock che bevevo da ragazzino. c. Beer-shop.it 17.01.20\n",
      "Pours clear amber with an average, lacing off-white head. Aroma of citrus, caramel notes and some spicy notes. Sweet taste that ends up being slightly more dry and somewhat bitter. Medium bodied, watery to oily textur and soft to average carbonated. An OK Lager. 🌟🌟🌟\n",
      "La brasserie Funders se tourne clairement ici vers les jeunes et la gente féminine avec une bière douce, aux accents de rosé et de grenadine. Pas de quoi se passionner pour un amateur de bière, et la question de se poser s'il n'est tout de même pas possible d'offrir mieux pour avoir une première approche de la bière à certains segments marketing (car il ne faut pas se le cacher nous touchons ici au marketing). Il est certain qu'ici, une touche d'acidité pour donner du pep's aurait été appréciable, tout comme un sucre un peu moins présent (mais ici tout est fait pour cacher l'alcool, car nous sommes tout de même chez les jeunes dans un paradoxe il faut boire de l'alcool, mais sans se rendre compte que c'est de l’alcool !). Sur la bière en elles même je n'ai malheureusement pas grand-chose à dire, le visuel est sur un rosé foncé sans mousse. Le nez est sur un mélange entre le vin rosé et grenadine et c'est d'ailleurs le duo que l'on retrouve de l'attaque au final en passant par l'arrière bouche avec tout de même un brin d'épices. C'est linéaire, poussif, avec un alcool à 9,2 % que l'on cache. Si la corpulence est honnête, la longueur est courte. Ce n'est pas parce que certains boivent n'importe quoi, qu'il faut brasser n'importe quoi.... Au contraire il faut amener ces personnes via des produits de qualité adaptés à apprécier la bière.\n",
      "I waiting so long time to find and after drink this beer in my country and i was so exciting to try it.. But all my excitement was nothing when i finally drink this beer..\n",
      "Anyway like i said i was pretty sure for how good can be this legendary beer and when i open it the aroma bursting my nose in the first secs. So much coffe inside and so much power. The beer is really lively.. And when i get the first draught, one massive mouthfeel fill my mouth and my stomach.. This beer is a real dynamite.. It has the most coffe flavor i have get from any other beer out there and i love that. The beer is so rich and complex and give you one insane mouthfeel and go down in your stomach so smouth.. Your mouth is so alive when you drink this beer.. You can get any detail from the flavors in your mouth.. Chocolate, caramel and one massive amount of rich coffe there.. Also the carboration is moderate and in the right levels.\n",
      "Overall one of the best and rich beers i have drink in my life. And also the most coffe beer too.. Despite \"Stout - imperial\" beers are so expensive, this one deserve every penny from my wallet..\n",

Citrusy, piney hops dominate the palate with bready malt and tropical fruit in the background.  Finish is long and dry.  I expected more from this brew.\n",

It's similarly light tasting with lemon & citrus flavours to kick things off, some grassy hops & straw around the middle & a subtle hop bitterness at the end. It's medium bodied & not bad given it's only 3%, with a freshness & quite a crisp, slightly dry finish. \n",

      "750ml corked and caged bottle. (2018 vintage) Pours an opaque black with a medium, creamy, short lived, tan head that laces. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate, brandy, bourbon, tobacco, vanilla, dried fruit and oak. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, chocolate, tobacco, licorice, candied sugar, molasses, maple, dates, figs, raisins, berries, vanilla, bourbon and oak in a sweet, warming brandy finish. Medium to full body with a creamy, smooth, oily texture and soft carbonation. Wow, a truly beautiful beer. Lots of complexity and dangerously easy to drink. A world class Baltic Porter.\n",
      "Pours black with two finger, dark tan head.  Aroma is vanilla, cocoa, roast and molasses.  Taste is creamy chocolate and brown sugar, moving to vanilla and roast.  Finish is chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla.  Tasty stout.\n",

      "Cookie spice aroma. Dark brown, scant head. Actually tastes like what it says.\n",
      "Outstanding sweet ham hock mouthfeel - substantial body to get your tongue ‘around’.  Smooth malt flavor...just enough ‘smoke’ to let you know you’re sipping something special.  Delicious!\n",
      "Really good, but not exceptional. Hoppy and resiny. Light gold with fluffy head  7/4/8/3/17\n",
      "Melon orange color with minimal head. Aroma is bitter hops and some big time sweet malts. Flavors are similar, bitter and sweet, witha significant alcohol presence. I don't think the flavor or aroma is with the big alcohol price tag. I can get as good or better beer for far less alcohol. 6/3/5/3/15\n",
      "Deep red pour. Minimal head. Aroma is boozy and spicy. Flavors reveal a note similar to frosting and certainly some light cinnamon. Good helping of booze and sweetness. A desert sipper for sure. 5/3/5/3/14\n",

L'amaro è pronunciato. La forza gustativa è normale e permane in maniera sufficiente. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di pronta beva. Il finale è amarognolo. Il retrogusto è di media intensità. Al gusto vengono donati toni di miele, frutta secca, luppolo, resina, pino, agrumi, cannella, spezie ed erbe aromatiche.\n",
      "Super crisp golden coloured body with a light pure white head, only a centimetre tall. Aroma of very fresh European/German hops with a nice Saaz kick and some light citrus notes with a dash of biscuity malt and a good amount of noticeable yeast scents. Light-bodied; Sharp pungent grassy and herbal flavour at first with a bunch of biscuit and light earthy malts showing some peated notes, but mainly a clean layer of malt with a good fresh hop bite that shows a good deal of alpha acids, some light herbal elements, but a fairly dry beer that is limited to the hop and malt notes. Aftertaste is dry with a lot of herbal and grassy notes and a touch of the citrusey characteristic from the European hops. Overall, a nice and floral, grassy and fresh-flavoured light lager that has a good deal of malt-based flavours that shows some perfume, but almost no sweetness at all throughout the beer aside from some mellow caster sugar notes way up front. I sampled this sixteen ounce can, given to me by the General Manager, after a hockey game in Arlington (Ballston), Virginia - Thanks Erik!\n",
      "Solider Bock. Malzbetont ohne Röstaromen, sondern Richtung Trockenfrüchte und Schokolade. Sehr rund und stimmig. Im Abgang etwas alkoholisch.\n",
      "From the 500 ml. bottle with no date noticed but probably from Oct 2019.  Handsome deep mahogany brown pour with a long lingering tan head.  Enticing aroma of smoke malts, smoked meat, and floral attributes.  The body is medium to full.  It is also very smooth.  The taste is just lovely with its smoky sweetness that usurps everything else save for the light floral finale.  What an extraordinary beer. But I am a fan of this style.\n",
      "16th January 2020Opaque dark brown beer, small pale tan head. Smooth palate, mildly dry, reasonable fine carbonation. Smooth and slightly dry dark chocolate enriched dark malts, a mild vanilla sweetness. Light but fruity bourbon. Trace of wood. Smooth fruity bourbon finish. Tidy.\n",
      "Strong thick coffee flavor combined with dark chocolate.  This is what an imperial stout should taste like. Big strong thick and powerful.  Nice finish. Well done!\n",

      "Bottle with a cork and a cage, like Champagne. Pours a slightly hazy white gold, with a very fine mousse, just like a Champagne. The taste is fruity, refined and slightly sour. Elegant notes of white wine and greengage are mixed with tropical fruit, lemon peel, cucumber, yeast and freshly cut grass. Some barnyard notes of wet horse blanket. This is a many-layered beer which repays careful and thoughtful tasting. It is a thing of rare beauty - an exceptionally well-made and beautifully balanced beer of remarkable quality.\n",

      "750-ml caged and corked bottle pours nearly opaque auburn-brown with a tiny tan head and residual lacing. Aroma: dark dried fruits, cherries, brown sugar. Flavor: raisins, plums, dates, figs, molasses cookies, fruitcake, caramel, caramelized malt vinegar. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied with a slick finish.\n",

      "Can at home picked up from Cloudwater online. An oily jet black coloured pour with a dense dark tan head. Aroma is dark liquprice, wood, tree sap, cakey malts, dried fruits. Flavour is composed of intense bitter roast that builds into acrid ashy roast, bitter liquorice. Hidden in there is layers of piney hop, burnt fruit cake. After taste is super intense, building towards unbalanced. Palate is medium full bodied, rounded, fine carbonation, oily slick finish. Intense stuff.\n",

Tries to be lively and exciting through use of lots of hops, but it's not, it's so, so dead. May have been better as a real ale, and if so, keg's ruined this.\n",

      "330ml bottle from Drinkers Paradise in Kentish Town for £2.50. Served at cool room temperature into a tumbler. The date code on the back label had worn slightly, all I could make out was 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer pours an almost jet black colour, with a thick look. A one and a half finger muscovado colour head generates. Loose looking and quick to dissipate away. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first aroma to strike is overwhelming liquorice. This also dominates the first gulps on taste. However, it soon does away to leave light aromas of dark dried fruits, raisins. Roasted malt is also prevalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "As aforementioned, liquorice dominates the early exchanges before fading away. Dark dried fruit, roasted malt and limited espresso then take the fore. I found the taste a little overbearing, too much going on for my tastebuds. \n",
      "\n",
      "The drink leaves the mouth feeling just slightly dry. The taste of the malt and dark fruit do linger like a strong coffee for some time in the mouth. Pleasant.\n",

      "Overall, I got a mixed level of enjoyment from this beer. The flavours just didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Well made but not something I’d seek out again.\n",
      "Pint can courtesy of Motortoddhead.  Pours a murky gray orange with a medium white head.  Unfiltered. Tons of sediment abound. Aroma of mango, orange, grapefruit and juicy hops. Taste of mango, orange, orange pulp, grapefruit and hops.\n",

      "Quite hazy deep golden and orange coloured body with a very soapy and quite tall, off-white head, about four centimetres tall that stays afloat for a long time. Aroma of alcohol, crisp grassy, citrusey and very herbal hopswith a lot of alpha acids, quite a bit of sweetness from fruits and a lot of malt as a good backbone. Medium-bodied; Rich deep flavour of alcohol, strong citrus, a lot of dry grassy and herbal flavours and showing almost a perfect balance of significant hops and associated bitterness with a lot of malt - mostly dry and grassy, with a nice layer of sweet and astringency from the alcohol and residual sugars. Aftertaste shows all the flavours melded into one consistent package, which has the right balance and potency - the hops hit strong, the malt is supportive and the complexity is nice, especially for the style. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA which shows some classy notes and a complex, dry and bitter West Coast IPA vibe that actually make this worth drinking/finding from Stone (a surprise, actually!), even a few days past the 'due date'. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Whole Foods in Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia on 18-December-2019 for US$2,99 sampled a bit less than a month later on 14-January-2020 at my house in Washington a few blocks away.\n",
      "Super deep dark brown coloured body with a thinnish, very fast-dying tan and off-white head. Aroma of alcohol, roasted malt, bunches of vanilla pods, anise, a dose of caramelised sugars and a heavy strong molasses and lactose note - very nice. Medium-bodied; Strong rich malty and milk-based/cream flavours dominate at first with bunches of roasted malt, anise and deeper flavours that have a lot of bitterness, but also a bunch of sweetness that all end with a strong alcohol bite, but tempered by the grain and the sugars, which are quite pervasive. Medium to almost Full-bodied; Strong rich grainy and oatmeal flavours dominate with mostly malt up front, but the molasses and caramelised sugar flavours dominate soon afterwards and lead into the more sweet flavours of vanilla and of course - loads of chocolate with a light bitterness from coffee at the end. Aftertaste shows a dense creamy, lactose and milky finish with a lot of body and a good deal of balancing sugars in the form of raisins and chocolate. Overall, a very nice milk stout that shows some deeper characteristics, while being fairly easy-to-drink and very smooth around the edges, even for being a very fresh beer! I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Total Wine in Springfield, Virginia on 20-October-2019 for US$2,79 sampled at home in Washington on 14-January-2020.\n",
      "Bottle, 330 ml shared with Max. Pours black with light brown head. Nice hoppy aroma, citrus, fruit, roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, bitter finish. Smooth. Medium bodied.\n",
      "A lot of interesting flavors in this one. Definitely some burnt charcoal like in most stouts but very earthy like licking a rock.\n",
      "Bottle. Golden almost amber with ok head. Mostly piney aroma with good malty biscuit side. Good fresh hop bitterness, medium bodied, lil sticky, nice classic floral hop profile. Finish is thin, some malty biscuits and pine. Good, but not sure what this really brings to the table. Would rather drink the flagship or Torpedo over this, but in the end it isn't bad.\n",
      "12 oz bottle from beer junction. Nice tribute to west coast style ipa’s. A bit malt and and a bit of the dark hops we have grown to love. Great!\n",
      "16oz can at home.  Hazy/cloudy golden orange with an eternal rocky off-white head.  Orange and lemon-centric citrus with added pineapple, mango, grapefruit, big dose of piney and grassy hops, bready malt.  Medium hops, full body.  Smooth, lingering finish with more piney hops.  Well balanced, not overly sweet, delicious hops showcase.  Excellent.\n",
      "Can from “AKFaust”. Colour...well...black. A thick tan head is present as well. Nose...hop resin and charred hardwood. Palate... full, robust and plenty hoppy goodness. The mid palate is quite dry and has a roasted chicory flavour akin to Postum. The finish is long and laced will Maduro wrapper.\n",
      "Draft at Moriartys. Mostly clear golden orange pour. Fluffy white foam at the start. Some lace at the top. Honey tangerines. Pinecones. Dried apricots. Grapefruit. Cardamom. Coriander. Hop forward but lots of sweet light caramel malts. Medium body. Bittersweet finish.\n",

Finishes quite crisp, with a very light bitterness and some floral hops and lime peel lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this is pretty good for a light lager, with a great balance of sweet malts and floral, slightly herbal citrus hops, it still is what it is, with a pretty light body and flavor profile. Crisp and semi-dry, with a light bitterness, this is sure is easy-drinking and refreshing, but still seriously lacking in flavor. I've done my best to rate this to style, but I'm not sure just how far you can take this style. I mean, sure, it's a lot better than Coors Light, but what does that really say? I can certainly see no reason to ever purchase this again over their excellent Pale Ales at a very similar ABV and price point.\n",
      "0.5 l bottle from 'craftbeer-shop.com', cellared for more than a year. Almost clear, deep ruby with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, beige head. Sweetish-malty, gently fruity and slightly resiny aroma of strawberry jam, molasses, marmelade and some pine. Gently sweet, malty, slightly bitter, quite fruity and a bit resiny taste of molasses, strawberry jam, raisins, marmelade and pine, followed by a medium long, gently bitter, moderately resiny finish. Medium to full body, smooth and gently effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Well-brewed and well-balanced as always, very pleasant, nicely hoppy as well.\n",
      "Aromat wyraźnie beczkowy z akcentami czekolady, karmelu, chleba, marcepan, alkoholu. Barwa ciemno brązowa do czarnej, nieprzejrzysta.

      "12oz bottle - nose is pine.  sip is more pine with some citrus.  hoppy indeed but not that bitter.  I'd rather have a Torpedo.\n",
      "Can. Pour slightly hazy orange amble with high whitehead that went away quickly. Aroma of apricot. Taste orange melon, ripe apricot, malty sweet mellow mouthfeel. Light caramel finish. Medium-light body. Light bitterness for IPA. Easy-drinking.\n",
      "1.5 litre bottle of the 2019 Edition with friend in Newport Beach. Pours a chestnut brown with a very thick, light brown head. Aroma of caramel and spices. Taste is caramel with notes of nutmeg and cinnamon with hints of ginger and orange. Good bitterness to offset the sweetness of this delicious Christmas Ale. Mouthfeel is OK, but a little thin. This is a pleasant and well-made beer.\n",
      "12 oz bottle. Pours a deep, dark mahogany with a medium tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, bourbon, dark fruit, maple and rum. \n",
      "Taste of bourbon, figs, dark malt, maple syrup and rum.\n",
      "355 ml bottle at Viking lines MS Rosella. Clear amber with white head. Caramel and marmalade. Smooth and semi sweet with medium bitterness and medium carbonation.\n",

      "Mouthfeel: Medium full body. Medium carbonation. Light warming.\n",
      "Overall: Malty with good hop support and complexity. Not sure about the haziness. The beer might be showing a few signs of oxidation, I wish I could taste this fresh.\n",

      "Bottle. Light bronze body with a bright white head. Nose of grapefruit and musk. Hints of caramel. Taste had some orange juice and almonds. There is just a hint of spice in the finish. Nice but a little boring.\n",
      "Pours clear, bright golden with a three finger, white head.  Aroma is caramel and floral hops.  Taste is caramel, moving to hops backbone.  Finish is caramel and hops.\n",
      "May 28, 2019 bottling date.\n",
      "BB May 28, 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken from a 44°F fridge, pour begins after ~5+ min.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma is banana, spices, floral, sweet malts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Color is gold, slightly hazy, plenty of rising bubbles to a 1/2 inch white, thick, and creamy-appearing head from a fairly gentle pour, which quickly falls to a 1/4 inch thick creamy cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is spicey backed by the fruit tastes - banana, perhaps other indistinct (apple, maybe), with a solid sweet-ish floral backing. The spiciness is very peppery, and the banana and apple(?) carry throughout.  The floral breadiness adds a lift to the taste that is quite nice. Little alcohol present in the taste, but you can definitely feel it about half way through.  Only a very slight bitterness in the beginning that is pretty much gone by the middle. The finish is sticky and semi-sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium feel, tilting to the thin side, but the primary feel is the carbonation tingling counteracting the creamy smoothness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, dangerously too easy to drink quickly given the ABV; I needed to consciously slow down, because I found it too enjoyable; I just wanted to just sip, sip, and sip again. An excellent tripel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice strong aroma of roasted malts, hints of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly black from the front, dark ruby with a backlight.  Tall, thick, khaki head, creamy, with good retention. As it recedes, the top is cratered and bubbly, leaving good looking thick strings of lacing down the glass. Ample rising bubbles visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is roasted coffee/malts, and as with the aroma, hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Mild bitterness shows up in the middle and carries through to the finish and aftertaste.  The finish is semi-dry with the mild hops bitterness providing excellent balance to the dark malts. This lingers into the aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body has some heft for the style, but objectively medium bodied tending toward the thin side.  The mouth feel is somewhat dry with good carbonation sparkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, an excellent Robust Porter. To my taste, in the same class as the Founders, only slightly better in the strength of the aroma and taste.\n",
      "From a 33 cl bottle.  Pours a clear dark mahogany with an ecru head.  Aromas are of toffee and caramel.  Flavors are moderately sweet caramel malt.  Very nice beer.\n",
      "2019 edition. Dark amber or even coppery beer with nice beige head. Aroma of caramel, some hops (?). Very malty, moderately sweet with a bit bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "Bottle thanks to Drake! Amber pour with a gigantic soft beige head. Dried floral hops, lemon zest, wheat nose. Banana - soft and overripe (but not sweet), wheat, nuttiness, bread. Nice.\n",
      "Tap at Tap 40, Crewe (as 6.3%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bit of a complex case this one.  It calls itself an India Porter, but I would say it’s really a Black IPA.  It pours jet black with a strong but transient beige head.  The nose has coffee to the fore, but plenty of citrus in the background.  The initial taste is sharpness, bitter like lettuce base.  But there is also coffee and chocolate with burnt toast hints.  The finish is bitter black coffee, and alcoholic warmth in the stomach.  Excellent !\n",
      "\n",
      "bottle.  Poured clear dark amber with a big beige head. Typical astringent citrusy IPA aroma. Medium bodied, slick mouthfeel with creamy carbonation. Flavour of roasted grainy malt, with copious bitter herbal hops, notes of citrus and pine.\n",
      "Dark brown with ruby edges. Large dark brown head with high retention. Aroma intensity 4/5. Toast, coffee, butter and metal aroma, notes of earth. Heavy bitter, gentle light sweet. Oily texture. Full body\n",
      "Lots of floral, spicy hops, light lemon or grapefruit, tasty yeast and malts, decent, lingering bitterness.  MF somewhat grainy, nice but for me at least a little bit starchy and soapy too.  Not spectacular but refreshing, elegant and surprinsingly interesting tasting, very good.\n",
      "Аромат конечно карамельный и паточный. Много специй, но приятных, немного корицы и медовой соты. Цвет темно карамельный, пена на удивление есть но тонкая. Вкус немного разочеровал. Начинается все средне плотно, немного паточно, снова специи, ванильное мороженое. При глотке просто очень жесткая горчинка, которая сильно портит все впечатление, и при этом она очень продолжительная и забеирает на себя все вкусовые нотки. Послевкусие немного ореховое, снова нотки карамели но уже за горечью меньше. Очень много лактозы в пиве, и это ощущается. В целом, могло быть намного более топового.\n",
      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 19/10/2006.  York did make some darn good cask ales in a good range of styles.  This was a very tasty strong mild.\n",
      "Can from Struise Shop, Bruges. Pours cloudy yellow with a huge, slowly diminishing, frothy, white head. Aroma of dank lychee, pineapple, peach, onion, herbs, pine, grapefruit peel. Taste is sweet juicy peach, pineapple & papaya, some dank onion with a sourish touch, going over bitter pine, spices, kept together by doughy malts. Dry, floral & earthy hoppy finish, lingering yellow fruit, spicy pine, noticeable hop burn. Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Very assertive & tasty NEIPA-like.\n",

      "Odense twenty twenty winter pt 1 tasting. Black with a small tan head. Intense dark flavour of licorice, dark chocolate, molasses and vanilla. Sweet roasted flavour with a huge, full body. A touch of alcohol, but otherwise a very fine, intense dessert beer.\n",
      "Draft at FOB, Rimini, Italy. Pours reddish brown, with a nice head of whitish foam, fine. Aroma is intense of caramel, plus fig, raisin, alcohol, Bourbon. Body is thick, with moderate carbonation, and quite a stickiness. Taste is intensely sweet, with a nice final spicy feeling. Limited bitterness. A nice bomb for the winter!\n",
      "Opaque amber body with a nice and persistent ivory head. Aroma is malty, fruity, caramel and roasted almonds. Taste is malty, with mild mineral notes. Dry and mineral finish. Low body, average carbonation oily texture\n",
      "330 bottle from a past European Swap. Pours darker, copper, some haze and sediment inside, a few whiter bubbles on the top. Sweet nose with dried dark fruits, plums, figs and cherries. Resembles a nice barleywine. Taste has slight acidity, sweet and fruity, pulpy mouthfeel. Warming and soft, high alcohol beer. Slightly oxidised by now and that feels nice. Full favours, full body and rich with nuances.\n",

      "12oz bottle from Beers of Europe and drunk on 29/09/2006.  I really enjoyed this at the time, and when I’ve had it since, it still stands up as a great, roasty, full, but sessionable Porter.\n",

      "473ml can. (5.0% ABV) Pours a clear blonde with a medium, foamy, long lasting, white head that laces nicely. Mild aroma of bready malt and grassy hops. Sweet flavour of grainy malt, bread, grass, light lemon, black pepper and floral hops in a crisp, dry, mild bitter finish. Light body with a watery texture and average carbonation. Clean, easy drinking. Pretty solid.\n",
      "Dark orange gold.\n",
      "Quite malty and hoppy flavor with dry & bitter after taste.\n",
      "Refreshing type of beer but has depth.\n",
      "12 oz bottle.  Hazy amber with a medium soapy white head.  Botanical aromas with citrus, flowers, pine sap, apricot and toasted sugars.  Hoppy but balanced well with lighter sugary malts.  Juicy and effervescent.  Citrus juice and peel, spices, and lightly bitter finish.  Very nice to drink.\n",
      "delicious beer. hop layer is between the pale ale and the torpedo. just a great tasting beer.\n",
      "Can (1 pint). Pours hazy straw with white head and lacing. Grapefruit and orange citrus aroma with some dank pine notes. Grapefruit rind upfront with some orange notes followed by some dank pine. Long, dry finish. Medium body. Excellent.\n",
      "Unbelievable beer.  High alcohol which is masked completely by a milk chocolate coffee toffee taste.  5 stars. wow\n",
      "Shared pint can poured to a snifter displaying a clear, straw color, with a fluffy layer of white froth, and waves of lacing. The nose was soft grain, slight malt sweetness & corn, with a hint of fruit. A little less than medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste was similar, including some spicy & grassy hop influence, and subtle dryness to the finish. Very sessionable.\n",
      "Pours dark purple with a thin white head. Aroma of tart stone fruits. Taste has cherry, dark malt. Palate has tart cherry. Good. Nuanced.\n",
      "A magnificent Imperial Stout.  Pours a dark cavernous brown with a good ruby red and brownish head.  Works a good puff but not too much.  Head settles down to a simmer at the edges.  Aromas of candied sugar, molasses, chocolate, and roast malts meet the olfactory bulb.  Taste is stellar with previously mentioned aromatic notes along with a base of leathery chew, tobacco, light bitterness from hops and great carbonation.  Creamy mouthfeel. Pitch perfect.  This stout is well balanced with sweet bitter, perfect roasty malts and bittersweet chocolate down the run.  A long dry finish rounds out this true sipper.  There are only a few stouts in this class...   would have again.  YUM!\n",
      "12 oz can courtesy of Motortoddhead. Pours a deep reddish brown amber with a medium cream colored head. Aroma of whiskey, bourbon, candies malt and barley. Taste is much the same as the aroma.\n",
      "Can: Poured a black color stout with a nice large dark foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with black chocolate notes is interesting. Taste is also a mix of roasted malt with some black cholate notes and light residual sugar notes are faint. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Solid stout with plenty of flavours.\n",
      "Pours a dark brown color, lots of bitter malts in the taste, definitely its defining quality, very smooth, tap.\n",
      "Can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom. 10/17/19. Real deep red color. Flavor shows me herbal notes, caramel, and toffee. Hearty pine bitterness. Overall, this is a standard west coast influenced amber ale. Pretty boring. \n",

      "Got this in a trade with Jay Whitson. Thanks Jay!! 2018 edition, waxed and capped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours as pretty as a barrel aged Stout can get. Pitch black, 2 fingers of tan foam, superb lacing and head retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smells of Bourbon, winter spicing..cinnamon and nutmeg, roasty, chocolate of the sweet kind, little bit of coffee, very boozy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of lovely cinnamon up front, a mix of both dark and milk chocolate, Bourbon, light coffee, good roasty character, alcohol ever present and some would probably say..too much!\n",
      "Well, 14%abv IS 14%abv...\n",
      "\n",
      "Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. I get quite a bit of bitter chocolate in the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way that I can describe this beer overall is, luxurious. A must try in my book.\n",
      "Bottle at Fortnight in downtown Providence, RI.  Magenta, lightly cloudy with a cm of light-pink head, moderate-poor retention.  Aroma is big raspberry, grasses, touch of neutral dry grain dust, bit of hay field underneath, substantial raspberry pith in there too.  Body is medium-light weight, oily-watery, bit starchy, medium-light carbonation, medium coarseness, light burn, somewhat creamy, somewhat frothy.  Flavor is tart raspberry, some nutty pithy, some drying dead grasses, bit of hay and lake vegetation, very lightly bitter, just a bit of fruit sweetness comes through.  This is nice, although I'm not sure if I buy into the super-high ratings of this beer.  It's a nice Berliner.\n",

      "75 cl bottle @ home. Pours black with a tan head. Arom and flavour are roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon - with a slightly roasted finish.\n",
      "Złoty opalizujący zamglony. Piana wysoka, dość drobna, długo się trzyma, zostawia lejsing. Aromat średnio intensywny, słodowo-owocowy, przyprawy na drugim tle ale wyraźne (kolendra, gałka, imbir), jakby lekko winny. W smaku słodkawy bardziej słodowy niż owocowy, miodowy. Finisz dość długi korzenny, przyprawowy - nieco pikantny, wytrawny i umiarkowanie rozgrzewający w przełyku. Odczuwalne ciało i umiarkowanie wysokie wysycenie.\n",
      "Yellow, hazy, white beerhead, with lacing, medium, and frothy foam, ok retention. Quite hoppy on the first impression; citrus, grapefruits, and pine are the main characters, also a peach note behind the citrusy flavor, nice balance within them, somehow sourness (lemon juice?), medium sweetness, soft carbonation, medium body, medium-high bitterness.\n",
      "Bottle at the December Ratebeer DC Tasting. Poured a deep, dark brown color with a small tan head. Smells awesome. Aroma of pancakes, coffee. Maple syrup. Sweet, with enough roast from the malts and coffee to keep it balanced, at least balanced enough for a pastry stout.\n",
      "Can. Clear reddish brown with beige head. Aroma is toasted bread, caramel malts.  Nutty with faint fruity notes (dried apricots). Dry with medium tartness. Regular Brown Ale with some welcome hops.\n",
      "Hazy pineapple juice pour with a creamy white head.  Aroma of pineapple, peach, and tangerine.  Pineapple, mango, peach flavor with some tangerine and pine.  Very tasty!\n",
      "0.5 l bottle from 'Bierothek' as 'Ayinger Kirtabier', best before June 2020. Clear (after carefully pouring only half of the bottle), dark amber with a reddish hue and a medium large, frothy, almost stable, off-white head. Slightly sweetish, malty aroma of caramel, honey and a touch of nuts. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, gently malty taste of caramel, honey, some nuts and a touch of raisins, followed by a short, slightly bitter finish. Medium body, smooth and slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Decent, simple Lager, expected way more.\n",
      "Can.  Delightful strong hoppy aroma and flavor, with hazy fruit background flavors.  No off-flavors, slightly bitter finish.  Hops/malt ratio ~ 5/1.\n",
      "Had this as Knoblach Stammberg-Bock. Huge thanks to Erzengel for sharing. Bottle looks simple but good. Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Spicy aroma. Starts strong-malty, spicy, some herbal notes as well. Finish spicy-malty, light alcoholic. Interesting one!\n",
      "Can from Ølkassen. It pours hazy yellow with a creamy white head. The aroma is citrusy hoppy. Spicy grapefruit or pomelo. Light passion fruit. Some lime zest. The flavor has some bitterness. Nice and refreshing.\n",
      "Draft at Growler Guys. Dark pour, not much head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma of coconut flakes and roasty ash. But damn, this is so sweet and so viscous. I can barely sip it at first, and even as my palate acclimates it's dreadfully hard going. I ended up leaving part of the glass on the counter.\n",
      "Tap at magic tree. Coffee nose. Clear pale. Coffee & pepper taste is prominent. Decent overall coffee beer experience. Better than expected.\n",
      "Bottle @ Home. Pours hazy burnt orange with a small offwhite head. Aroma of malt, light sourness, spices, herbs, spruce, lemon. Flavor is light sour, malt, yeast, herbal, spices, spruce, little lemon, little wood. Thin to medium body, soft to average carbonation, dry and light acidic finish. 120120\n",
      "Appearance is amber, with a half-finger fizzy white head. Aroma is peach, pineapple, orange and mango, soft hoppy fruits. Taste is bitter hoppy fruit, orange, pineapple, peach, mango hints, juicy fruit. Smooth in the mouth, slightly bitter finish.\n",
      "500ml bottle brewed in England at 4.1%. Crystal-clear copper colour. Nice-sized fair-duration head. Aroma of sweet brown bread malt and tangerine citrus. Moderate- carbonation. Surprisingly dark toasty malt, mingling with gentle but tangible tangerine citrus, touching base on their respective bitter ends. Really nicely balanced, and surprisingly thick and full of flavour (if fairly straightforward), never mind for the ABV. The care taken and quality of ingredients also come across, partly in the yeast character (surprisingly discernible for so clear a beer) but especially the water - this beer is approximately 95% water, and the imparted character from the unique source is quite noticeable and well-received! A living legend, not much better out there now for a pub drink, and if it's overrated it's only in the same way the Beatles were. Don't go into this expecting an all-singing all-dancing craft-style experience, this is an old school best-of-class, and lives up to its reputation. Also damned inexpensive to pick a few bottles up, another thing to be thankful for. A smooth luxurious 'session' ale, perfect pub fare, exuding quality - but if there's anything to take away from this beer it's how inoffensive it is. Part of the reason this is so many people's favourite ales is how it just doesn't put a foot wrong; not everyone has it as their favourite tipple, but how many have a bad word to say about it? Exactly.\n",

      "16 oz can. Pours slightly cloudy golden. Smells of sweet doughy bread and some clove spice yeastiness.  Tastes of a touch of doughy bready sweetness and bright wheat. Back end is clove yeast and a little bit of bubble gum. Medium body. Not oppressiemvely yeasty or sweet, like a lot of other hefeweizens. It's pretty good for a style I don't generally enjoy.\n",

M: Medium body with medium-high carbonation; very round and smooth; finish is medium dry. O: Very nice IPA; lots of tropical fruit and citrus, with a clean, complimentary, firm malt profile; interesting spice notes, too.\n",

      "This particular bottle is heavily oxidized, but i think the underlying beer is solid, belgian candi and malty with yeasty bubblegum flavor. Online beerwulf bottle\n",
      "Une bière blonde mi-claire, mi voilée avec une bonne carbonatation et peu de d'effervescence. Au nez, assez fruitée avec des touches de mangues mais aussi d'agrumes. En bouche, une certaine amertume, avec la touche florale signature Hill Farmstead. Je trouve la bière anormalement élevée en amertume avec peut-être une touche de manque de corps. Les nôtres fruitées arrivent tranquillement mais je trouve que la bière manque d'un petit quelque chose.\n",
      "Une bière blonde tirant presque sur la blanche, mi-claire, mi-opaque avec une bonne carbonatation ainsi qu'une bonne effervescence. Au nez, bonne dose de houblon exotique, avec l'ananas notamment en avant-plan. En bouche, une touche assez florale, assez vermontoise, avec une amertume un peu plus contenue que dans d'autres bières de chez Alchemist. On retrouve peu de l'ananas décrit en bouche, mais tout de même une touche quand même. L'amertume se révèle un peu plus au fil des gorgées. Intéressante mais sans plus.\n",
      "Hazy pale yellow pour. Hoppy nose. Fruity, light but also very juicy. Very nice DH PA!\n",
      "Shared 12 oz. bottle poured to a snifter showing a clear, dark brown color, with a tan layer of froth. The nose was dark caramel, sweetness, a touch of dark/dried fruit, cocoa, some nuttiness, and a hint of barrel induced vanilla. Medium+ bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar, with warming bourbon, and some tannic & earthy bitterness. Suits the season well.\n",
      "Pours pitch black with a brown head. Aroma and taste is of dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel notes. Full body. Soft carbonation. Very nice oily texture. Roasted finish. Excellent.\n",

      "Bottle @ Saxo tasting. Unclear orange with a small white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, heavy spruce, herbal and tart. Flavor is quite sweet and moderate acdic. Dry and moderate acidic finish. Has absolutely nothing to do with a Finnish Sahti. 110120\n",
      "Bottle @ Højbjerg tasting. Nice head with good duration. Color is amber. Aroma and taste are rich sour lactose acid, fruits, malt and has a nice long sour finish. Doesn't taste like a traditional sahti, more like a sour/wild.\n",
      "Poured amber with a big cloudy head. Lots of hops and citrus in the aroma, as well as the taste. Ok beer. Overhyped\n",
      "Money Moves has a think, beige head, a very dark brown appearance, and minimal glass lacing. The aroma is of intense, salty peanut butter & chocolaty malt. The flavor is of those elements, with lots of sweetness, too. Mouthfeel is heavy, and Money Moves finishes on the sweet side. RJT\n",
      "Awesome malt backbone. Hoppy. Moderate pines and fruits. Slight dank. Mouth of creamy goodness. Well balanced. Very well done APA. Love it!\n",
      "Espresso ist hier in der Tat Programm, sowohl in der Nase als auch im Trunk direkt wahrzunehmen. Dann kommt das Brown Ale durch, malzig, Karamell, süffig, leichte Bitternoten, aber nur ganz wenige, lecker.\n",
      "Very aromatic, dominated by powdered cocoa. Sweet, but a hoppy bite. Well balanced and drinkable\n",
      "Bottiglia. Il gusto al naso viene attratto dal frumento e dallo speziato. La finezza olfattiva è normale e il modo in cui permane è sufficiente. Il manto birroso superiore è caratterizzato da una schiuma dalla buona tenuta. La grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il liquido è di apparenza velata e anche qui la grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il colore è giallo dorato brillante. Il corpo è pieno. L'amaro è pronunciato e c'è anche una componente leggermente acidula. La forza gustativa è elevata e la durata è buona. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di pronta beva. Il retrogusto è di decente intensità. L'aroma in bocca porta i segni di miele, frumento, frutta secca, pane cotto di recente e banana.\n",
      "Light beige weak head. Dark brown colour. Aroma is malty with fruity (prunes, dates ) and very light roasty notes. Flavor is malty too with fruity (raisins and prunes)   tones, ending in a moderately fruity finish. Medium bodied.\n",
      "Super maltosa. Cacao, café, caramelo, toffe. \n",
      "Destaca su final seco y amargo que le restan dulzor y evitan que sea empalagosa, lo que favorece otro trago rápido.\n",
      "Un cervezón muy bien diseñado y desarrollado.\n",
      "Podría parecer una belgian strong ale pero con poco gas y final americano, levadura limpia.\n",
      "Draft. A golden beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of hops, citrus fruits, and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of hops, citrus fruits, and malt, leading to a bitter finish.\n",
      "Cask at The St. Albans Beer Festival on 28/09/2006.  Didn’t like this vintage as much as others.  Maybe it was too young and on cask didn’t help.  Still good, but the booze was a tad too present.\n",
      "On tap at the Moor Taproom. Cloudy dark orange with small white head. Malty, some caramel, toasted, fruity notes, sweetish with some bitterness in finish. Easy drinkable. Smooth. Medium bodied.\n",

      "Goût : L'entrée est marquée par les mêmes arômes qu'au nez puis, on a une transition vers une finale plus pimentée et quelque peu plus torréfiée. Si l'entrée est plus sur les notes sucrées du chocolat et du malt, la finale se veut plus épicée et amère, bien que ce soit contrôlé.   \n",
      "Sensation : Corps moyen-plus, fort chaleureuse, aspect pimenté en bouche, bonne longueur.   \n",
      "Bref : Belle diversité des arômes dans ce stout aux notes sucrées non négligeables, mais ne tombant pas dans la catégorie des bières desserts qu'on rencontre de plus en plus.

      "Poured from can.  Late Harvest version.  Pours hazy golden with white head. Aroma is pineapple with citrus.  Flavor is tropical fruit with crisp citrus.  Some onion and dank hop finish.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Pours a deep gold with off white head. Hot alcohol on the nose with hints of malt and bitterness. Full body with rich malt sweetness and a lot of hop presence tucked away. Interestingly low alcohol in the flavour. An interesting beer but surprisingly huge.\n",
      "16 oz. can, pours an opaque, cliudy orange with a small white head. Aroma is loaded with fresh doughy, gentle piney hops, and bready malt. Flavour is fresh, with gentle piney hops and doughy notes. Fresh, doughy finish. Excellent.\n",
      "Poured from a can. Frothy head that thinned out quickly. Nice, golden hue with a hop punch nose - mostly tropical fruits. Very smooth and easy to drink for a big beer. You can tell it’s strong, but the masterful balance of hops and malts show no signs of booze or harshness. Well done. Cheers!\n",
      "16 oz. A month old. Aroma is cantaloupe, peach, orange, my nutsack. Pours hazy orange golden with a collapsing bone-white head. Taste has a moderate pithy bitterness along with some moderate juicy sweetness. Great creamy mouthfeel. There's something funky here both in aroma and flavor that's reminiscent of sweaty balls, but I can look past it and see that it's still a tasty beverage.\n",
      "Pours a cloudy yellow with a white foam head. Aroma is barnyard funk, earth, and citrus. Flavor is lightly tart funk, peppery yeast, with hints of grapefruit and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is way too bubbly. Pretty good.\n",
      "16 oz can from Tavour. Hazy, milky pour, one finger foamy head. Light, dry hoppy aroma. Taste focuses on the hop variety, bitter citrusy notes, drying out at the finish. Heavy body, thick.\n",

      "12 ounce, canned 12/05/2019. Deep brown with a thin film of cream on top. Nose is chocolate toffee with hints of earthy spice. First tastes are the same with a bit of earthy/peppery peat and vanilla. Nice light hand on the spice shaker so there are small notes of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg that develop and complement, rather than overwhelm, this fine Scottish Ale. Medium-plus body with almost mid-level carbonation and a good balance.\n",
      "Deep copper color with an off white head. Nutty malt flavors pair nicely with an aggressive hop array. Quite bitter. Pine and resin hops. Well done\n",
      "Clearish golden pour from bottle. Pretty decent stuff, clean piney hops, citrus etc. Well done\n",
      "Draft to taster at Cappy's. Pours a dark caramel brown color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor have caramel, light chocolate, spices, dark fruits, mild bubblegum, light roasted malts, hint of banana, actually lighter and not as over the top as expected.\n",
      "Copper color with a spice aroma.  What a winter ale should be.  Caramel malt sweetness with maple syrup flavors.  Floral hop bitterness to balance.\n",

      "Dark stout, smells alcoholic and spirit like. Taste is strong, treekle like and smoked. World class beer\n",
      "16oz bottle from Beers of Europe and drunk on 27/09/2006.  This was at the time an absolute mind-blower, because it was by a mile the most accurate Belgian-style beer I’d tried that wasn’t from Belgium (or at least Benelux).  Actually they remain some of the best beers of these styles outside Belgium.  Wonderful dubbel.\n",
      "330ml bottle from Beers of Europe and drunk on 21/09/2006.  A classic and one of the more rounded and accessible tripels.  Loads of big spicy, fruity flavours.\n",

      "Can. Nose is brown sugar, malt, fruit cake, almond, cherry, christmas cake. Taste is brown sugar, prunes, cherry, almond, hints of vanilla, fruit cake, vodka, dates. Bitter hop note and burnt sugar which stops it being cloying. \n",

      "Muddy brown, moderate off-white head. Aroma: esters, fruit, nuts, coffee, yeast, basement notes. Medium body. Taste: medium dry, malty, fruity. Additional coffee, bread, nuts. Light bitterness. Complex. Very interesting.\n",
      "0,44 boks fra statens helsekostutsalg i Verksagta, hjemme  mens jeg lager middag: en fantastisk liflig duft slår mot nesegrevet i det jeg heller en uklar korngul, fint skummende væske oppi mitt GBGF-glass. En NEIPA-aroma som bare sier \"drikk meg, drikk meg\". Saftige, tropiske frukter, lke safti søt citrus, ganskudd og en solid maltkropp. Hva mer trenger man på en fredagskveld? Ikke så mye mer.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy dark amber color, thick beige head. Intense clove, spice and banana aroma. Medium to dry taste, medium to low bitterness. Clove spicey, banana fruity aftertaste. High carbonation, full body. \n",
      "This is just the perfect Weizen for me, I love it.\n",
      "From can thanks to Gene (Travlr). Light unclear golden color with white head. Hoppy and light malty aroma, pine, grass, dank grassy, citrus. Sweet and moderate bitter taste. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Beers of Europe and drunk on 06/09/2006.  A very smooth, quite roasty stout, with hints of sweetness, but primarily coffee and roasted malt flavours.\n",
      "Floral and mango aroma. Some papaya. Lots of tropical fruits. Hoppy stuff. With a hit of lingering moderate bitterness. Tasty and enjoyable!\n",
      "Muy buena cerveza de estilo american hoppy lager de cuerpo justo y muy aromática\n",
      "500ml bottle from Beers of Europe, and drunk on 01/09/2006.  Always liked this one.  Just a very solid, well balanced Porter.  Only mild complaint was that it was a tad overcarbonated.\n",
      "A bit blunt, to the point, but good all the same. Like the look your boss gives you when you show up to work noticeably hungover, yet still do a good job\n",
      "On tap at Archive. Pours slightly hazy gold w/thin white head, light citrus aroma. Easy drinking and well balanced w/rounded bitterness throughout, a bit of a spicy palate to finish.\n",
      "Pours clear bright golden with a three finger, white head.  Aroma is strong hops and lacto.  Taste is thin caramel, moving to lacto and hops.  Finish is strong hops. A hoppy \"gose.\"\n",
      "Как и ожидалось аромат очень копченый, но не концентрированный, много дымки а также намеки на хлеб и карамель. Пенка средняя а вот цвет темно янтарный и глубокий, манящий конечно но. Вкус на удивление весьма питкий, дикие 8 градусов не ощущаются от слова вообще. От дуппель бока нету тоже почти не следа, только легкая карамельная нотка которая полностью поглощена солодом и копченостью. Хотя при глотке она тоже не особо сильная и приятная, и даже не напоминает рыбу. Наверно и есть намеки на хлеб но тоже под нежныи слоем копчености. В целом один из лучших копченых пивасов что пробовал.\n",
      "Pours hazy amber with one finger, white head.  Aroma is citrus, lacto and tequila.  Taste is grapefruit, moving to tart lime and wheat.  Finish is grapefruit, lime and tequila.  Good sour.\n",
      "Grande IPA, non eccessivamente amara, pulita in bocca e definiti gli aromi, tipici dei luppoli usati.\n",
      "Da berne a secchi\n",
      "Decent white head on a clear amber liquid.  Moderate lacing.  Very slight hop aroma.  Taste is very clean; slight hop bitterness with earthy notes and a hint of carmel in the finish.  Smooth in the mouth with barely dry finish.  Drinkable lager.\n",

      "12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy dull amber with a big dense off-white head. Smells of leather and apricots. Complex combination of malt sweets and then the hops kicks in for a lingering sharply bitter finish. A great taste journey with an astringent mouthfeel with less of the overly juicy notes that are so popular lately. Very good.\n",
      "Can from BrewDog Lothian Road. Hazy golden body with an off-white head. Steady carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of pine, stainless steel and resin. Flavour of lemon and pine with a long, bitter finish. Medium body with a slick texture. Soft fizz. It’s a decent IPA but I expected it to be better based on its score here.\n",
      "I poured it from the bottle into a tulip.  It pours black with a tan head and lacing.  The aroma is great.  You get maple syrup, bourbon, wood, chocolate, and coffee.  The taste is the same.  This is dangerously smooth and delicious.  This is a great sipping beer.  Everything is done nicely.  Nothing is over the top.\n",
      "Nice old school IPA. Good looks, great nose, fresh, piney, citrusy. Great body but carbo is on the verge of too much but it's cool. Well balanced pale and caramel malts and hops. Nicely bittered finish. Yeah, could toss a few. 12oz bottles from statelineliquors.\n",
      "Bottle; supermarket in Copenhagen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a cloudy, deep golden with a touch of red. Frothy head - the foam sticks nicely. Inviting rose and hops scent. Taste is initially fresh, spicy hops accompanied by a floral, slightly fruity, kick. Then it turns more grassy and... mineral-y, almost like pine. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's intoxicating, and not just literally (although the presence of ethanol is clear as the hoppy bitterness fades). \n",

      "Cask at The Grainstore Brewery, Oakham on 26/08/2006.  Always a very solid golden ale.  Among the best out there at the time.\n",
      "2018 release. Appearance is dark ruby, a very small off-white foamy head. Aroma is maple syrup, toffee, caramel biscuit, raisin, dark fruit, Christmas cake, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, marzipan. Taste is sweet almondy malt, cherry Bakewell, sultana, sugary dark fruit, hint of milky chocolate, woody malt, vanilla, Christmas cake, maple syrup, bourbon. Very sweet and tasty, tastes nowhere near 12%.\n",
      "Can from Waitrose.\n",
      "Appearance - golden with generous lacing and a very slight haze. \n",
      "Nose - corn and lightly fusty. \n",
      "Taste - fresher this time. Green herb and corn. \n",
      "Palate - light bodied, creamy texture. Long, dry finish. \n",
      "Overall - a decent example of the style.\n",
      "Bottle.  Pours clear golden-orange with a white head.  Aroma and taste of orange and lemon citrus, biscuit, honey, and floral hops.\n",
      "Pourtant très grand amateur de bières allemandes et spécialement bavaroise, cette dernière ne m'a toutefois pas laissé un souvenir impérissable, la bouche me laissant une note difficile à définir.\n",
      "Piana koloru jasnego beżu, wybiła spora, ale też i szybko się redukowała, złożona z drobnych i średnich pęcherzy, zostawiła lekki ślad na szkle, na koniec pozostała w niewielkiej warstwie na powierzchni. Kolor bardzo ciemnego brązu, trunek prześwitujący. Zapach słodu, chleba razowego, karmelu, orzechów, siana. Smak słodu, karmelu, lekko palonych, kawy i czekolady, w tle goryczka chmielowa, czuć przyprawy, ale też z czasem jakby zgniliznę. Poza tym jednym jest spoko.\n",
      "Pours a hazy brown from a tap, tan head. Sure can smell that cinnamon! Some lactose too even in the nose. Tastes a lot like a cinnamon roll, cinnamon, vanilla, lactose, and some faint breadiness. Sweet and spicy. A little too sweet for my taste. Can’t imagine drinking a 6 pack but glad I tried it. Pretty good beer.\n",
      "Draft to snifter at The Pint Room. Looks good; a slightly hazy golden orange with foamy white head. Smells of tropical and citrusy hops alongside a mildly to moderately bittersweet backbone. Tastes like it smells, but more bitter, with a moderately bitter medium-bodied mouthfeel. Good, not great. Overpriced.\n",
      "Shared 2018 bomber viscously poured to snifters showing a black/brown hue, with some ruby highlighting at the base, a presentable layer of dark tan froth, and foamy spots & stands of lacing. The nose was roasted & cocoa, with some floral hints, sweetness, dark fruit, barrel induced vanilla & coconut, and lurking booze. Medium to full bodied, with inconsequentially low carbonation, the taste was similar, with roasted bitterness, slight barrel astringency, and plenty of bourbon. A solid style representative.\n",
      "2018's version is a blend of 24, 18, 12, and 8 month bourbon barrel Stout in 7-12 year Kentucky barrels at 13.6%.\n",
      "Draught @ Ginger Man - NYC. Clear dark brown with red highlights, small creamy tan head, mocha-rum aroma, low carbonation, medium bitter rich mocha taste with faint alcohol undertones, maple-woodsy flavor, smooth body, long mocha-rum finish. Delicious!\n",

      "I am not a stout drinker but bought this beer as part of a Brewers Pick 12 pack from Great Divide Brewery.  The beer is smooth and creamy like you would expect from a stout,  it’s hearty, it’s chocolatey. Having said that I’m not much of a stout drinker,  I did drink 2 of these while making dinner for the family, so I did find it be an enjoyable beer out side of my typical comfort zone.\n",
      "Poured from both a 750 ml bottle and the newer 375 ml bottle side by side. \n",
      "Aroma is spice forward with lots of coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise and allspice. Light dark roast notes with toasted bread and a light nuttiness. \n",
      "Both bottles pour a dark brown, almost black with a large, thick, creamy, mocha head that recedes slowly. The head on the older bottle is a bit darker. Medium lacing and moderately long legs. \n",
      "Flavor is somewhat sweet with light roast, chocolate and toasted bread notes. Moderate bitterness and light alcohol spice. So much spice though. Tons of coriander, clove, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. \n",
      "Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low,but present alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, this isn't good at all. It has way too much spice and is what I assume licking a spice cabinet would taste like. I find these undrinkable and I can usually drink most beers.\n",
      "473ml can. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold-yellow with a large, foamy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves chunky patches of lace. Aroma of grainy malt, lemon rind and grassy hops. Flavour of cracker malt, lemon peel and spicy hops in a crisp, dry, bitter grass finish. Light to medium body with an oily texture and average carbonation. Refreshing and easy to tip back. An excellent Pils.\n",
      "Will, Jared and Nick reviewed this beer on episode 70 of the Peaceful Treason Podcast for our weekly \"Cerveza of the Week\" segment.  This is the first beer that we and our guest all gave a perfect \"10/10\" score.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel and the taste of this beer are the crown jewels.  It's one of the most pleasant stouts available on the market, if you are lucky enough to find one.  The aging process in barrels that had stored both whiskey and syrup makes for one of the most unique flavors ever achieved in a stout.\n",
      "12 ounce can. Translucent reddish brown pour. Large foamy tan head. Sweet toasted malt nose hints at toffee and roasted nuts. Flavor follows nose with added notes of bakers chocolate and dried dark fruits. Spicy hops are subdued but offer nice balance. Rich and flavorful. An excellent American Brown Ale.\n",
      "Can. Pours clear pale straw with a small white head. Light malt, grass, hint of apple juice.\n",
      "Gold pour. Earthy smell with medium carbonation.   Wheat, grass, and oat flavors.\n",
      "Pounder: Hay nose, mildly fecal. Clear yellow, medium head. Hay and grass. Medium body, easy carbonation.\n",
      "Black in color. Very boozy aroma and taste. Malty, sweet, and bourbon barrel aged flavor. The pour is small, and they are saying the alcohol +15%\n",
      "500mL bottle at brewery.  Batch #2.  Pours gold with a small white head.  Aroma is funk, lemon, oak, butter, and floral.  Taste is tart; lemon, tea, funk, oak, herbal, and apricot.  Light-medium body.  Medium carbonation.  Smooth, slight spritzy mouthfeel.  Awesome.\n",

Loads of oranges in the nose with mostly the juices, and a bit of zest. The zest takes the top in the taste with some nice bitterness and dryness. Not sure if I have had Strata hops many times, but this really works nicely with the Citra. A juicier IPA, without being a NEIPA.\n",
      "From bottle. Dark brown color with beige brown head. Malty aroma, caramel, dark dried fruits, raisins, bourbon, wood, light chocolate notes. Sweet and light bitter taste. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.\n",

      "Tap at mad mex robinson, a pleasant surprise. Clear pale. Nice initial tartness that is greatly appreciated. Much better than most sour or tart IPA. Quite enjoyable and I don't like IPA. Since it said hopped I was thinking IPA but I was wrong, its just a slightly hopped berliner. Nice stuff and overall a great find.\n",

      "500 ml bottle, from Skjold Burne Hjørring. ABV is 5.5%. Beautiful clear reddish brown colour, huge white (or slightly off-white) head, overcarbonated. Aroma of malts and toffee, dark dried fruits and ripe red fruits, a hint of mild spices. Flavour with the same elements, moderate hops. Fizzy mouthfeel.\n",

      "Fruity flavors that are well blended.  This beer goes down very easy.  Nice pleasant finish.  I am not a fan of the Pale Ale beer style but this is a good one.\n",
      "Sample at All in beer fest 2019. Black with tanned head. Thick mouthfeel. Light roasted with milk chocolate, light coffee and a little chilli heat.\n",
      "330ml can (Sip, Tallinn) (6:3:5:3:11=2.8)\n",
      "Golden yellow. Pleasant hoppy aroma, bitter. Taste is harsh, acrid alpha acids. Thin palate, metallic bitter finish. Harsh.\n",
      "Canned, 330ml from Asda in Milton Keynes, Bucks. Gold with white head. There is a malty sweetness to this, some cereals. Lightly roasted malt with a bready hint, some lemon / lime hop hints. It's all somewhat unremarkable but drinkable. It's oaky.\n",
      "Amazing beer! V. 2016\n",
      "Killing aroma! The perfect balance between dark malts and wine.\n",
      "Taste. Pleasant body, a little dry. It tastes like a mix of wine, chocolate coffee. the finish is wine, there are alcoholic notes.\n",
      "Perfectly balanced delicious R.I.S.\n",
      "Pours a deep oily  black with a syrup-like thickness.  Very thin tan head, with lots of lacing  left on the glass as expected.  Nice initial aroma of coffee, sweet cream, and a little chocolate.  Thick going down and silky smooth.  No alcohol taste, but a little bitterness on the tail.  This is a decent stout, although a little plain.  Not horrible, not great.\n",
      "750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cloudy gold-yellow with a large, frothy, long lasting, off-white head that leaves thick patches of lace. Dank aroma of wheat malt, pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit flesh, pine and weedy hops. Sweet fruity flavour of wheat malt, caramel, pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit flesh, orange peel, nectarine, melon, pine resin and oats in a dry, mild bitter, spicy hop finish. Medium body with a smooth, oily texture and average carbonation. East meets west, the best of both worlds. Delicious and very enjoyable.\n",
      "Pours very dark brown with a creamy, light brown head which isn't in any hurry to go away; no lacing.  Mild, slightly bitter aroma with hints of metal roast aromas.  Initial bitterness with a roasty center and sweeter finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin despite the head, and at 5.5% I don't think it's worth the trade-off.  Overall it's fine, but the flatness is distracting and the only remarkable thing about it is how pretty the can is.\n",
      "2009 vintage bottle (opened 3 days prior) shared by alexsdad06 pour opaque black with minimal light tan head. Nose chocolate, molasses, light mineral. Taste mineral, chocolate, light smoke, molasses. Thick mouth feel.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle from Woodman's Appleton, 1/7/20. Hazy amber, large foamy off-white head, good retention. Aroma of dank, earthy hops, pale malt. A bit of lemon. Taste is citrus, orange, grapefruit, pine, pale malt. Medium bodied, hop forward (a rarity these days). Nice beer.\n",
      "It wasn't the best but it is what Sierra Nevada has been doing for 40 years. Making drinkable beers. Here's to 40 more.\n",
      "Had from can.  Pours a dark brown with moderate beige head.  Smells of robust roast barley - dark breads, oatcakes and cookies.  Taste is balanced sweet and bitter - smooth and rich.\n",

      "Nice and PHRESH from Moonraker, one of the more underrated breweries in CA. Nice cannabis fresh bag 'o weed aroma. Fluffy head. Pours hazy and amberish gold. Love it.\n",
      "500ml glass bottle from Morrison’s supermarket, Colindale. Part of a four beers for £6 offer. The bottle was dated as best before 10/2020. Served at cold room temperature into a pint glass. \n",

      "51cl bottle from California as a gift:\n",
      "Clear amber with some bubbles rising but it's lighter than expected. The head is fluffy & white, holding very well with good lacing too. The smell was a fresh & hoppy one with floral notes & a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus & grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine & subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated & medium with a clean feel & the alcohol content is hidden well too. Very nice & easy to drink; not the best DIPA I've had but it is certainly up there.\n",
      "Taster at Bittercreek. Black pour, collar of tan head. Aroma hints at dark malts and coffee. Taste focuses a bit more on the coffee, while very light, and a bit of cola. Schwarzbier? Could be...\n",
      "50cl bottle at Bar Pizzeria Bigno, Rimini, Italy. Pours hazy loaded gold, with abundant white foam, very fine. Aroma is pretty intense of banana, also grainy. Body is average, with good carbonation. Taste is medium sweet, not excessive. Final is average in length.\n",
      "Shared 12 oz. barrel poured to a small snifter showing a black/brown hue, with a presentable layer of tan froth, and foamy spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was roasted, malty, caramel/brown sugar & toffee  sweetness, dark fruit, some barrel hints, and vanilla. Medium+ bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar, remaining rather sweet, adding touches of treacle & soy, roasted bitterness, pronounced, bourbony booze, but not all of 16%, imo.\n",
      "W aromacie mocno chmielowe, pachnie bardziej jak bipa niż stout. Barwa czarna piana piękna. W smaku smukłe, lekko do średniej paloność, tutaj chmielu tak nie czuć. Półwytrawne, kawowe. Przyjemne.\n",
      "Pours black, no head. Rich chocolatey coffee nose, nore chocolate than coffee, hints of mint.  Smooth, surprisingly light, definite milk notes. Almost cola sensation later.\n",
      "Bottle thanks to SimonTomlinson. Hazy golden appearance. Aroma is lemon, grassy, tropical, pineapple and fruity. Flavour is wheat, banana, grassy and malt.\n",
      "An amazingly good beer. I am so happy I tried this one. Very promising. Well chosen, the 6 hops. Wow!!!\n",
      "2018 bottle. Pours a clear ruby-bronze color with a medium off-white head that diminishes steadily to an outer ring. Partial rings of lace. Aroma of tart fruit, oak, yeast and malt. Medium body with flavors of tart raspberry, oak, funky yeast, cherry and biscuit malt. The finish is oaky and tart with a berry and cherry aftertaste. Good beer all around.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Waitrose, Berkhamsted and drunk on 12/06/2006.  Quite a nice bitter, with nothing particularly special about.  Just solid.\n",
      "Can from Honest Brew. Cloudy pale straw colour with a white head. No lacing. Lively carbonation. Aroma: Citrus peel, grapefruit juice, grassy hops and bread. Taste: Bitter hops, citrus and a molty sweetness in the background. Crisp and easy drinking beer\n",

The nose is fresh, floral & clean, doesn’t overpower & is a mix of citrus, pine & grassy hops before some biscuit shows at the end. The taste is pine, citrus & the same biscuit backing with light grapefruit & a hop resin on top of a lively, well-carbonated beer that was crisp & very drinkable; outstanding stuff.\n",

      "From a 500ml can on 7/1/2020 Pours a clear deep golden with a medium head. Has a big resinous hoppy nose. Tastes of sweet caramel, bread and biscuit malt, which is met by a thunderous, clanging hop bitterness - masses of pine and resin which coats the tongue and lingers long. Medium bodied with average carbonation. A flavour packed old school IPA which has a lot going for it. Could just use a shade more balance, but still nice stuff. Great artwork on the can too.\n",

      "Can. Pours clear pale gold with a white head. Gusher. Gushed right on to my carpet so some deductions on the final score. But surprisingly good for a lager. Light malt, cracker, some earthy hops. Crisp finish.\n",
      "The pour looked pale amber in color and there were may small floaters in suspension to show off the unfiltered nature of the beer.  The head was pretty small though, topping off at less than one finger thick. The citric smell was quite potent, and evident at even an arms length, as the glass sat on the table. Bringing it closer revealed grapefruit and peach predominantly. The taste was quite sour at first, which was a little surprising. The acidic taste evoked citrus fruits, and the bitterness was quite subdued. There was a some hop resin in the finish, giving this beer a slightly gummy feel. You can feel the freshness of the hops quite clearly. Nice find at the local liquor store.\n",
      "Draft at the Masonry. Bright gold pour with a fluffy white head. I'm excited to get to try this one and it's every bit as good as anticipated. It's tart but only in an oaked-Nelson sort of way, not acidic. Pineapple and green apricot dominate, lime peel and some grapefruit pith. Aroma is good but the flavor exceptional.\n",
      "Bottle. Pours dark Ruby brown with lacing and a finger of beige head. Aroma is outstanding and complex. Gingerbread cookies, spicy whisky, oak barrel. Sweet malts, scotch, Christmas cookies and more earthy wood barrel flavor. For 11% it is stupid smooth and easy to drink. The flavors last, it's not overbearing at all. Wow. I loved Dirty Bastard and this is even better in terms of the flavors I like. Probably the best Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy you can get.\n",
      "Can (16oz).  Light golden cloudy yellow with one finger white head.  Nice strong citrus aroma.  Body is medium.  Taste is quite fruity with pineapple being the dominant flavor.  Some sweetness follows, finishing with a pineapple bitterness.  Yummy.\n",

      "( tap) clear, bright yellow orange colour with a small white head; aroma of vanilla, cinnamon; balanced flavour with a long, light bitter finish\n",
      "Can pour from the brewery, Canton. Appearance is opaque black with nice sparkle at the edges of the glass, finger-width attractive foamy light brown head with good retention and nice soapy lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, caramel and pine. Taste follows aroma. Mouthfeel is medium-to-full bodied with thick, frothy texture, average carbonation, mild alcohol warmth and mostly sweet finish offset by light bitterness. Overall, strong aroma and flavor are a good representative of the style but nothing revolutionary or particularly complex here.\n",
      "Bottle at home with Caressa, Apollo, and the wife. Pale yellow with a bit of chill haze. The aroma is citrusy hops, lime. Medium bodied, grapefruit and chalky mineral notes, dry well attenuated finish, bright and hoppy. Really nice .\n",
      "Aroma is sweet bread, plums and raisins, spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Color is dark brown from the front, murky ruby red with a back light.  1/3 inch tan head from a careful pour into the chalice, thick, creamy, uneven top, excellent retention. Thick sheets of lacing on the opposite side. Upward showers of bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is somewhat bitter in the beginning, and this remains in the background throughout. Dark fruits, raisins, mild spiciness.  The taste is fairly complex, with the interplay of fruit, spice, and a dry bitterness that borders on astringency. The bitterness is more like bitter coffee (albeit with no coffee taste) rather than bitter hops. The finish is surprisingly toward dry, given the sweetness of the aroma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel is smooth and a bit thin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a very good traditional dubbel.\n",
      "De Bieronomy. En copa Teku. Viendo The Mandalorian 1x06-07. Perfil a bourbon bastante agradable, aunque los hay mejores, mas complejas y que se suben menos a la cabeza\n",
      "Creamy, super sweet, sour, blackberries, raspberries. A little too sweet for my tastes but still good overall.\n",
      "Can from The Wine Cabinet in Reston, VA\n",
      "Aroma: caramel, coffee, chocolate\n",
      "Appearance: dark brown with a tan head\n",
      "Taste: medium sweetness, medium bitterness\n",
      "Mouthfeel: light carbonation, creamy feel, medium body, long finish\n",
      "Delicious\n",
      "Bottle from Yamaya. Had this one many tome over the years. Direct line to brain with light pruney aroma, some other dark fruits, rainsins, and light cocoa. Thick dark brown and a finger of tan foan. Gentle roastiness, chocolate, dark fruit, and thin cocoa lining the tongue. Pleasant bitterness. Not overdone. Well balanced all the way.\n",
      "Kroger bottle. Golden-copper with a soft off-white head. Nose is orange and grapefruit peel, light floral hops. Flavor is orange peel, grapefruit flesh, light pine.\n",
      "Brassy golden orange.  Slightly sweet and bitter with citrus pine and hop oils.  Quite nice.\n",
      "2018 vintage. Chocolate, vanilla oak, licorice, candied sugar. Chewy body and prominent barrel notes. No flavour depth though and no expected complexity. And way too much booze. Very disappointing.\n",
      "Аромат неплохой, имеются сладкие нотки от цветов, что удивительно хмель, а также легкие дрожжи. Цвет мутный, темно желтый, пенки что удивительно чертовски мало для стиля. Вкус странный. Сначала газы и дрожжи с какими то яблоками, причем слегка кислыми. При глотке самое странное а именно горчинка от хмеля, при чем весьма горькая и продолжительная, что мне не понравилось. И в принципе только легкая пшеница с такими же легкими дрожжами. Странная и не очень вкусная пшеничка.\n",
      "It sure has nauseating amounts of vanilla. The vanilla is so strong and overpowering that it makes an artificial impression. Take the most pastry-overclocked pastry stouts that are in vogue right now. There is also a good amount of dark chocolate and coffee and a little bit of barrel notes, though overall it tastes like a cheap perfumy cheesecake in chocolate coating in the form of beer. Nah.\n",
      "Very malty, sweet dried fruit, mainly dates, some rather uninspiring (though not bothersome) coffee, accounting for a stouty twist, some licorice. very thick mouthfeel, also boozy. Light coconut-tinged bourbon. No flavour depth and a bit too boozy. Decent though also disappointing.\n",
      "330ml glass bottle dated as best before xx/xx/xxxx. From Whole Foods Market, Kensington. Served having been out refrigeration for about 15 minutes into a tumbler. \n",
      "\n",
      "Deep dark brown, almost touching black. A small finger and a half tan head. Dissipates quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is heavily malt driven, molasses, caramel, confectioners sugar and dark dried fruit. Some limited apple. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is sweet and heavily malty. Dark fruit and molasses. Easily drinkable, similar to a English strong ale. Fruit cake-like. Flavour balance not present but does not diminish the enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet in the mouth. Lingering malty, molasses tastes. An unexpected amount of carbonation that is fairly lively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, from the small haul of holiday ales I got this festive season, this one is my favourite but also the simplest. A very good beer.\n",

      "All of the leather tobacco coffee and dried fruits that you may desire for such a strong stout. Highly recommended\n",
      "On tap at Hoppy Corner, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out lots of rich coffee upfront, with a lightly toasted malt backbone. Flavour likewise reveals a rich coffee character upfront and dominating, with a hint of dark fruits further back. One of the best coffee porters I can think of in recent memory. Excellent.\n",
      "6/1/2020. Bottle from Cobbetts, Dorking. As Buxton Extra Stout. Pours dark brown almost black in colour, with a thick tan coloured head. Aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, black treacle, nut and dried fruit. Moderate sweetness, medium to heavy roasted bitterness. Full bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation. Very good.\n",
      "Bottle shared @ Malt & Mold. Very dark brown/black with a very thin ring of lacing, bourbon-chocolate/mocha aroma, low carbonation, sweetish mocha-dark chocolate taste with strong bourbon flavor, alcohol undertones, thin body, long bourbon finish. Strong and tasty, also very boozy!\n",
      "Copenhagen 27/12 2018. 33 cl bottle from Høkeren, Kbh N. Drawing of little snowman with a star in one hand and a glass of beer in the other. Long golden scarf with a Christmas greeting hanging around his head. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pours hazy orange with medium-sized white head. Settles as thin layer of foam just managing to cover the surface of the beer. Crawling up the sides of the glass. Moderate lacing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma is has a sweet and sugary quality. Bubblegum, fruity banana and hard candy. Underneath it I can smell a solid malt-base and some humid Belgian basement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Light carbonation. Slightly thick, oily texture. Sticky.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor is heavy sweet followed by medium strong bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish with a lighter spicy bitterness. Lingering. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sugary sweet without being nauseating due to a notable bitterness giving a little balance. Solid, sweet Belgian.\n",
      "Copenhagen 26/5 2018. 75 cl corked bottle from Den Belgiske Ølbutik, Jyllingevej, Vanløse. Dark bottle with print. Both the heavy metal logo from Bush and \"Prestige\" written in florid handwriting. A bit schizophrenic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pours hazy amber with very big bubbly head making a fuss. Settles as thin patchy layer of foam. Moderate lacing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma is sweet, sugary and potent. Caramel, brown sugar, banana, hints of marzipan and boozy alcoholic odor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soft yet prickly carbonation. Quite thin texture. A little oily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor is sweet without being cloying. Followed by light spicy bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish and woody. Clear presence of alcohol. \n",
      "\n",
      "A very pleasant, quite sweet and boozy acquaintance.\n",
      "At £8.20 for a 440ml can I actually got a good price on this beer from Brads Beers in Rotherham indoor market. But I found it very regrettable. To me it tastes exactly like a swisher sweets chocolate cigar. Artificial and synthetically sweet.  Had it not been so expensive I would score it higher, but I was not impressed with this beer one bit. It tasted false.\n",
      "Pick black, creamy, malty smooth.  Almost like a cross between a barley wine ale and and an imperial Stout.  YUM!\n",
      "An incredible amount of bourbon and oak barrels in the aroma and taste with tones of smooth chocolate and coffee. Exquisite bitterness in the aftertaste that fills the mouth forever. Perfection on bottle! Follow me @ Kung av öl @ Facebook for more pictures and ratings.\n",
      "Ich weiß, dass viele Leute begeistert sind von diesem Bier sind, aber mir war es einfach zu brutal. Das Bier ist primär süß und alkoholisch, aber ohne feine Fruchtnoten wie es mancher Belgier hat. Hier fährt man wie die Iquisition mit dem Knüppel voll über die Zunge her.\n",
      "Es mag seine Sinnvolligkeit haben, dieses Bier in einem kalten Klostergewölbe zu trinken, um das fasten zu umgehen, aber im Vergleich mit modernen Bieren ist es einfach zu flach und brutal.\n",
      "500ml bottle. Pours a clear golden amber with an off white head. Aroma of citrus, orange, grass, grass, lemon flavoured cream biscuits. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel. Flavour of orange marmalade, eart, spices, citrus and some floral elements. There is a zesty bitterness that cuts through right from arrival to finish. A little different from what I was expecting, but good nevertheless.\n",
      "Tap @Mikeller Bangkok. Hazy pale yellow little foam. Medium body. Taste mango, pomelo juice. Juicy yet piney and slightly sour passionfruit finish. Amazing\n",
      "Pours dark brown with a smallish beige head. Sweet and intense aroma with notes of raisins, caramel and dried fruits. Taste is sweet with syrup, caramel, raisins and a hint of coffee. Finishes with dryish touch of alcohol. Full body with sticky and sugary mouthfeel. A good and typical bock beer. (Poured from a 0,5l bottle, bb 04.04.20)\n",
      "Bottle split at CCV, picked up at the previous years GBBF IIRC, Cotteridge Wines 08/06/19.\n",
      "Murky golden orange with a decent off white cap.\n",
      "Nose is dusty hops, earthy fruit rinds, candied orange peel, straw, grains.\n",
      "Taste comprises stoned fruits, grape must, funk, orange peel, straw, musty fruit, grains.\n",
      "Medium plus bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close with a kiss of alcohol.\n",

      "Pleasantly surprised by this smooth IPA. Very easy to drink, not real strong hops.\n",
      "12 oz bottle from a variety 12 pack.  Amber body beneath a soapy white head.  Aroma of bread, hay, caramel malts and slight cinnamon spices.  Clean and crisp finish.  Very slight stickiness.  Classic example and well done for the style.\n",
      "Deep ruddy amber-brown pour. The aroma has a touch of sweet malt, some toffee, caramel and light woodiness. There's a little bit of light fruitiness. Some cooked fruit and a little bit of plum and prune. There's a bit of light molasses as well. Decent beer.\n",
      "Aroma is dark cherry, clove, caramel and dried cranberries. Taste is deep cherries, clove, tart, soured grapes and fruit yogurt. Nice fragrant and tasty beer.\n",
      "Bardzo fajnie przyprawowe, ale nie słodkie - wytrawne. Sporo suszonych owoców, lekko może karmel. Pełne, gładkie, nisko wysycone. Ale przede wszystkim przyprawowe i wytrawne.\n",
      "Bottle from my cellar. Ebony pour, small soft ring of beige head. Sweet roasty aroma. Taste is sweet, milky, chocolate with an afterglow. Incredibly smooth.\n",
      "Aroma is soured grapes, wine, Tamina and funk. Taste is heavy wine character, fresh pine needles, soured grapes and butter bark.\n",
      "Bomber. Clear dark reddish brown that is black in the glass, large, foamy, tan head that lasts and laces at first but then dissappates. Aromas of bourbon, dark fruit, plum, raisin, toffee, light caramel, spice, vanilla, chocolate, and wood. Flavor is the same, sweet and complex with a spicy finish. Medium plus bodied, smooth creamy with a dry, warm finish. Hides the ABV  well and is incredibly smooth.\n",
      "Pours an orange bronze color.  One finger white head.  Okay retention, great lacing.  Lightly hazy. Aroma is heavily hoppy.  Lots of grass, lots of bitter hay and pine...yet not overwhelming.  A lot of floral.  Hoppy, but not bitter... Taste is floral and bitter.  Fresh and earthy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied.  Sticky and kinda oily.  Well hidden alcohol.  Smooth and clean. Overall it’s good.  Not quite what I think of as a pale, but delicious.  I would recommend it and would buy it again.\n",
      "12 oz bottle from Tavour. 2019 vintage at 14.1%. Pours out a dark, clear brown with a tiny ring of fine bubbles. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is more of the sweet malts with some molasses notes. Finishes with a nice glowing warmth, pretty gentle for a high ABV beer.\n",
      "Hazy amber pour. Thin white head. The aroma is loaded with pine and some sweet malt. Sort of a toffee, iced tea and herbal/pine nose. The flavour is sweet and a little bit fruity. As it starts to warm, the herbal/tea notes start to settle down and there’s more of a straight up pine and grapefruit hop aroma. There’s a touch of something in here that I definitely don’t love. Okay.\n",
      "Can bought at BrewDog Leicester, drunk at home. Dark gold, pretty hazy with a ring of white head and a scummy white head. Some apricot, melon, white grape and lemon biscuit on the nose. Initially sweet with a nice malty hit followed by bitter and slightly astringent hop. Some peach and TCP in the aftertaste. Medium to heavy carbonation. Delicious!\n",
      "Drunk in late 2018. Thick, creamy, chocolate liqueur, coffee ice cream, lots of roast, light leather furniture and pumpernikel, forest fruit, roasted coffee finish. Amazing balance and flavour depth. Outstanding beer.\n",
      "Drunk in late 2017. Dark chocolate, coffee, pumpernikel, light vanilla, light fruity coffee. Creamy, smooth, amazing flavour depth, more coffee in the flavour, mellow yet captivating finish. Absolutely outstanding!\n",

      "Draught at a burger/craft beer joint in Singapore. Blueberries, blackberries, cherries, lots of chocolate, coffee, licorice, subtle tobacco. Smooth and creamy, high drinkability despite its ABV, earthy coffee finish. Quite dry, which is really nice in this era of pastry stout overflow. Superb!\n",
      "Draught at Absurdalna, somewhere between 2017 and 2018. Dark chocolate, redcurrant, vinous notes, raspberries, coffee, pumpernikel, subtle vanilla, thick, oily and smooth beer. More fruity aroma and more malty flavour. Sweet-bitter, balanced, alcohol hidden. Its reputation is justified.\n",
      "Can from a friend thanks for the opportunity! \n",
      "Hazy electric lemon in color with a decent sized bubbly white head that shows moderate retention. Tangerine pineapple grapefruit mango just dripping with citrus. Light bready maltiness provides a backbone for the hops. Outstanding beer.\n",
      "Canned, from glasbanken.se.  Cloudy golden, firm mid sized head. Aroma of lime and tangerine. Mid sweet with medium body and clean, rounded mouthfeel. Mostly key lime, some grapefruit. The 65 IBU are well hidden. A luxurious version of Grape Tonic with added lime. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy barrel aged, oatmeal and raisins aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy dark dark rich sweet flavor with a moderate to heavy dark boozy sweet finish of medium to long duration. This is a standout beer met my expectations.\n",

      "Bottle from Beers Of Europe.\n",
      "Pours a clear dark mahogany/ruby colour with a thinnish beige head. Fairly lively carbonation in the glass. Aromas of roasted malts, dry dark fruits, fruit cake, caramel, treacle, syrup, cherries, berries, tobacco, leather, roasted bread and a little sugar. Taste has all the notes as the aroma. Slightly sweet but not overly so. Full bodied with a lovely smooth oily chewy mouthfeel. Much lower carbonation on the palate. Nice malty lip smacking aftertaste. Easy drinking for 7.1%, alcohol is well hidden. Very nice.\n",
      "On draft. Light golden color,  with a white head. Clean dry malt, cracker, melon, grass, notes of citrus, and some dank hops. Tasty and easy drinking. Definitely not a traditional pilsner.\n",
      "Łohoho, ależ to dłuugie ma usta, wypijesz łyk, zaśniesz i rano jeszcze czujesz smak. Gęste, genialna wanilia z beczki, aromat nie jest taki obiecujący, trochę alkoholowy, ale podniebienie wynagradza wszystko. Piwo do sączenia godzinami. Umiar wskazany.\n",
      "Bevuta alla spina in baita a Gares. Tipica bionda molto buona nel suo genere.\n",
      "Amber clear with a one finger wide head.\n",
      "Smell of roasted malts with a caramel note and a hoppy background. In taste a roasted malty side melts with a strong bitter one, rich and smooth body. Low carbonation and a nutty, bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "A fine beer.\n",
      "Which is easy to drink weiss beer, but also very clear and little bit less bodier than usual weizen beers. It is like a typical lager style i think but it has unique notes of taste and it is very permanant senses for every bottle.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy golden colour with a medium fine pored white head, nose is yeasty, bready and a bit fruity and spicy with notes of iced biscuit cake, banana and cloves, taste is sweet, fruity and bready with a tart and slightly boozy finish.\n",
      "Drickes 2 SVT under sommaren 2019. En drickes i Djursvik. Underbar doft o redan här vet du att det är en riktig höjdaröl. Smaken är SÅ balanserad. Choklad nougat lite kaffe med bourbontwist. Söt krämig rund o go eftersmak med en fin mjuk beska som ligger o skvalpar i gomseglet.\n",
      "Bottle at Fierce. It pours hazy bright yellow with a decent foamy white head. The aroma is musty bright, funk, peach, yellow plum, spicy, hay, kitty litter and granny smith apple. The taste is crisp, soft, sweet, juicy, tangy, musty, funky, earthy, yellow plum, lactic, leather, soft fruits, must, funk and leather with a drying finish. Medium body and decent, foamy white head. What's not to like!?\n",

      "Opaque black beer with slight yeast and with a medium brown/dark brown head. Medium/heavy aroma; taste starts medium/heavy sweet and ends slightly/medium bitter and dry. Fruit, chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and coffee. 8/5/9/5\n",
      "Best pale that's around almost, greatly balanced and fruity as hell.. scores better than most nedipas\n",
      "14/IX/19 - on tap @ Wanderlust (Brussels), BB: n/a - (2019-1397) Thanks to Sebletitje, Rubin77 and ElManana+1 for sharing today’s beers!\n",

      "Very cloudy blond to beige beer, big solid creamy white head, stable, adhesive, leaving a nice lacing in the glass. Aroma: oh yes, lovely stuff, very juicy, dank hops, very nice! MF: ok carbon, medium to full body. Taste: lovely, super juicy, fruity, dank, tropical fruits, soft bitterness, lovely stuff. Aftertaste: nice bitterness, super juicy, dank hops. Love it!\n",

      "AROMA: Aroma a malta medio, tostado con notas de café,. Sin ésteres. Lúpulo bajo con tonos florales. Notas bajhas de alcohol. APARIENCIA: Color marrón muy oscuro casi negro. Opaca. Espuma abundante sin ser excesiva. Color canela suave. Persistencia media. Cremosa. SABOR: Maltosidad elevada, con fuertes notas de café y caramelo. Lúpulo bajo con suaves notas cítricas y florales. Equilibrio maltoso evidente y un final suave. Amargor bajo. SENSACIONES EN BOCA: Carbonatación media, cuerpo medio. Calentamiento por alcohol muy bajo. Suave, sin astringencia. Una cierta viscosida muy leve. IMPRESIÓN GENERAL: Muy buena cerveza con una agradable sensación en boca. Muy bebible y muy agradable ala trago.\n",
      "Lovely IPA with the distinct hope taste.. fresh an fruity and not too sweet.. goes well with Danish “smoerrebroed” (open sandwich)\n",
      "Sixpack from the supermarket in Watsonville. Old-school IPA brewed more or less to perfection. Plenty of c-hop or similar, but none the ruinous oils. Caramel malt but no overt sweetness. So drinkable. This would be a classic if it had been around since back when.\n",
      "It pours slightly murky copper orange with no head.  The arrival has stone fruit, caramel, oak and richness.  It has a medium full body with light carbonation.  The taste has caramel, pear, oak, red wine, alcohol, apple, citrus and vanilla.  Delicious.\n",
      "2014\n",
      "Belated birthday bottle to me in a lovely red wooden box. It pours translucent brown, no head or lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, nutty, caramel, mild oak. Tastes quite sweet, elegant and velvety, without any sort of carbonation. Reminds of aged wines like fine Port. Flavours lingers, with caramel, ripe fruits, spices and oak notes. A sofa sipper (Birra da Divano, as its label read) that you want to be eternal. Just awesome.\n",
      "Sample 12/9/16 (Binny's Montgomery) Pours black with a small head. Aroma of bourbon, roasted malt, and coffee. Taste of the same with not much hop taste. This full bodied brew is very potent but also very tasty.\n",
      "750ml bottle. Poured a hazy golden color with a medium sized head. Yeasty, nice lighter funky and tart finish, citrus, and some grass.\n",
      "A traditional Sierra Nevada IPA, as firmly entrenched in their brewing ethos as you'd expect a 40th anniversary beer to be. Pine, grapefruit, cedar, resin, and a mild herbal-floral note, underlined by caramel and biscuit, then bitter and woody with a hint of yeast on the finish. Not flashy, not trendy, but absolutely delicious.\n",
      "Can and Tap at Godspeed Brew Pub & Store. Pours a nice dark dense brown color, roasty and kind of chocolate and demerara aromas and tastes, nicely dry hint of hop finish. Bready roasted barley. The palate is spot on, full and yet never treacly. Ashy bit of smoke is a house trademark.\n",
      "2020/01/03 - 2019 Vintage. Pours dark brown (nearly black), with a thick, foamy, beige head that quickly reduces and leaves no lacing. Aroma is rich chocolate, vanilla, toffee, oak, bourbon, lots of tobacco and roasted malts with hints of black cherry and dark red fruits. Taste is loads of toasted malts and tobacco and hints of chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, licorice and dark red fruits. Mouthfeel is full and oily with soft carbonation and a long finish that is sweet, toasty and warming. Wow. Fantastic beer. The tobacco notes add complexity and depth.\n",
      "6 pack for futzing around house this weekend and nfl playoffs.  Clear orange pour one finger head.  Nose is light resin and pine.  Taste of little orange citrus, some peppery notes, resin and subdued pine.   Clean palate.  Easy drinking.   Seems a subdued choice for 40th anniversary but it is tasty.\n",

      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up in the US. Pours totally clear honey gold with a frothy, white head that settles into a cream. Holds moderate sweetness, a little alcohol, dried biscuits and grains, lemon peel, subtle yeast expression. Medium bodied with active carbonation. Nicely balanced finish, with more notes of citrus peel, biscuits, wheat, nips of grass and yeast. Highly drinkable.\n",

      "Bottle pour from Colonial Spirits, Acton. Appearance is lightly hazy yellow with nice sparkle, thin cap of white head receding to persistent ring and no lacing. Aroma is wheat, yeast, fruity esters. Taste is strong wheat, fruity esters, mild banana. Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with thin, frothy texture, soft-to-average carbonation and crisp finish as taste. Overall, great representative of the style.\n",

      "On [email protected] Ranzani 13, Bologna. Naturtrüb und hellbraun. Saurer runder Duft. Essig und Trockenpflaume. Klasse. Saurer weicher Geschmack. Fast wie alter Balsamico mit Apfel.

      "355ml bottle. Sweet, heavy with caramely malty notes, toffee, bourbon, plums, oak and fudge. Heavy and sweet. Okay.\n",
      "Pours a clear burgundy color. Aroma is oaky. Hints of triple bock. Tastes of dark fruit, vanilla. Warm in the mouth. Unlike anything I’ve tasted before. Outstanding\n",
      "Bottle. Orange amber pour. Aroma of malt, buttery caramel, whiskey booze, grapefruit and vanilla. Taste of watery malt, buttery caramel, vanilla, orange and grapefruit. Aroma is stronger than the flavor, but it's nice.\n",
      "Butelka. Piana zwarta, beżowa, złożona głównie z drobnych pęcherzy, zredukowała się do warstwy na powierzchni, szyła na szkle. Kolor bardzo ciemno karminowy, trunek przejrzysty. Aromat wędzonki, lekko słodu, karmelu, jeszcze mniej czekolady, wanilii, rodzynek. Smak jak na podwójnego koźlaka zaczyna się delikatnie, na co ma pewnie mocny wpływ dębowa beczka, a co jest również i zwodnicze, jest wygładzony, aksamitny, by z czasem przejść w nuty wędzonki, ale przeplecone czekoladą, czy wanilią. Ogólnie piwo choć ma swój ciężar pije się lekko i przyjemnie, mi podchodzi.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Asda, Watford and drunk on 05/03/2006.  I’m not quite sure why this beer gets any particular reverence, but it’s a decent best bitter and the bottled version is still quite pleasant.\n",
      "Pint can. Pours a deep cloudy honey gold with a medium frosty white head. Aroma of mango, pineapple, orange and juicy hops. Taste is much the same as the aroma. Excellent.\n",

The aroma and flavor have tart dark fruits, black cherries, roasted malts, some acidity, chocolate, apple vinegar, the cherry character is huge, I really liked this in the smaller 5 oz. sample but would have struggled with more (although I had a little more).\n",

Words to describe this beer are pale wheat malts, citrus, grass, sourdough.\n",
      "Huge thanks to Erzengel for sharing! Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Womderful hoppy aroma. Starts mild, malty, more and more fruity, notes of apricot, mild sourish touch. Dry bitter background. Finish well balanced, milder, almost a bit washy. Not bad!\n",

      "Draft at The Partisan. Pours coca-cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Lots of bourbon and coffee on the nose and tongue. I’m getting a trace of cinnamon on the finish. Hides it’s booze very well\n",
      "Bottle pours very hazy light gold. Pretty fruity hop aroma. Healthy carbonation, Brett, sticky floral hops. Wouldn't have guessed it's 8% but it is a bit of a heavier saison on terms of body. I like that the Brett is there and mixes well with the hops but doesn't overpower the beer.\n",
      "Aroma is citrus/fruit and slightly earthy malts.  The flavor is citrus/fr, earthy malts and a West Coast ipa bitter hop finish.\n",
      "Chicory, coffee, chocolate malt, and hay aroma.   Dark brown with large brown head.   Moderately sweet coffee chocolate malt, and mildly bitter chicory, coffee grounds, and hay aroma.  Good body.     Very tasty - strong chicory presence.\n",
      "Growler from Whole Foods.  Poured very dark brown opaque with pretty tan head.  Full bodied, with licorice, molasses and roasted grain prominent in the aroma.  Great, complex taste - licorice, sweet milk chocolate , wood and bourbon notes.  Chocolate mildly boozy finish.\n",
      "Clear, tawny blonde pour with a tall, sticky white head.  Squat 12oz bottle, Fair label.  Doughy, yeasty aroma with vegetal hops. It has a good malt bill, moderate bitterness, and is biscuity.  Hops really come through on the back end.  Not esteric or fruity. OK, drinkable.  ABC Liquors, Bull Run.\n",
      "Pours dirty yellow, unfiltered cloudy with a white, fully lasting, 1-finger head that leaves very good lacing. Aroma of sweet tropical fruit, hay  and calgon dish detergent. Medium body, lightly bitter and light to medium sweet, average carbonation, flavors of pineapple, apples and  black tea. Finish is lightly bitter, brief and dry. Very good.\n",
      "2013 vintage. 0,5l bottle. Pours dark brown with no head. Aroma of oak, whisky, slight smoke, malt, vanilla, toffee, dark fruits. Taste is peat, oak, malt, toffee, vanilla. Finishes on a peat smoked, malty finish.\n",

      "Bottle from the local Raleys. Pours clear, bright copper with a nice near-white head. Intense aroma of citrus/pine - not very resin tho. Mouthfeel is somewhat lush (bottle is 3 weeks old) and about med body. Flavor is citrus/pine on the verge of hop burn. Supporting slightly roasty malt. This is very good stuff.\n",
      "Delightful to the nose and the palate.  very Smooth, and yet with just enough English ‘gun metal’ character to let you know it’s from across the Atlantic.  At  5 abv can be sipped for a nice extended session.\n",

      "34.5cl fles. Vlokkig troebel donker robijnrood van kleur, middelfijne romige licht bruine schuimkraag. De geur is chocolade en rood fruit. Smaak is zoet, chocolade, karamel en rood fruit. Vol body en veel koolzuur.\n",
      "On tap at International Beer Bar, pours a cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of bright piney hops, some dank notes, and some juicy stone fruits. Flavour is juicy and pithy, with gently dank hops, lots of juicy stone fruits, and just enough malt to balance. Juicy and nicely hoppy, with no harshness. This is excellent.\n",

      "A rather expensive bottle found in Guadeloupe, but what the hey, this thing is hyped and I'm on vacation. Poured slightly chilled it has okay dark beige foam and brownish black body. Smells of deep and heavy maple and coffee, the coffee takes centre stage but the maple helps immensely to tone it down a bit. Some vague wood notes and coffee liqueur is showing. Taste is deep syrupy coffee liqueur in a good way, maple is helping to smooth and balance everything out. Mouthfeel is  smooth and chewy, warming, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I'm not sure how it could get better than this. Nonetheless this is very good, heavy but extremely balanced. It also works very well with the 22 month aged comté cheese I somehow found here in Guadeloupe.\n",
      "On tap at Capone's. Poured a deep brown color with a thin sized tan head. Wood / oaky, bourbon, brown sugary sweetness, vanilla, roast, and dark fruits.\n",
      "12oz can.  the description says it best - smooth and crisp german-style lager.  tasty\n",
      "On tap at The Alehouse - Palmhof, pours a deep dark red / burgundy with almost no head. Aroma reveals that characteristic balsamic / red wine vinegar quality, with gentle oak / wood in the background. Flavour is tart and moderately-to-highly acidic, with balsamic, red wine, and wood. The acidity is high, but kept in check so that it’s not enamel-stripping. Not sure how much of this I could drink, but it’s very well-done.\n",
      "This is a backlog rating from 2013 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are toasted malts, chocolate, peppery spice, marzipan, caramel, interesting.\n",
      "Draft. A black beer with a lazing dark brown head. The aroma has notes of cake, chocolate, and roasted malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of chocolate, cake, and roasted malt, leading to a dry finish.\n",
      "Good, solid aroma of citrus and pine. Hints of something sweeter - pineapple, perhaps?\n",
      "\n",
      "1/2 inch thick, creamy white head with decent retention, leaving thick lacing and a pitted surface as it drops. Color is clear deep amber with ample rising bubbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial feel is thick (for an APA) and smooth, which remains pretty much throughout until it is overcome by a bitter middle and finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial taste repeats the citrus from the aroma, with a substantial malt sweetness behind.  The middle becomes more piney and bitter, but the bitterness is always controlled by the balancing sweet malts. Aftertaste is piney and moderately bitter. The finish is tending toward dry, but enough sweetness remains that it never actually gets there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is an excellent APA. Hoppy, but well-balanced and delicious.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hoppy. Punch of lingering bitterness. Yes, it's a punch. Slightly bready. Light sweetness. Medium bodied. Refreshing for a 30 Celsius night.\n",
      "This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are sweet malts, oaky, Brett, funk, floral, good.\n",
      "Perfect for a Friday after work willing to chill. Pours cloudy copper, small white head, which retains around the glass, no lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, marmalade, fruits. Tastes quite sweet, rich in flavour to recall caramel, marmalade, apricots, raisins. Flavour lingers, and goes slowly, and improving as the beer warms up. Viscous, full bodied, no carbonation, booze comes up later. As every edition a joy for malty beer lovers.\n",

      "Can from Wine Press, Beacon St, Boston. Malty, hay, flowery, citrus, fairly bitter. Low hop profile. Canned 24 Jan 19. Not fresh. Shouldn't be for sale.\n",
      "Draft at Mekong. Pours Coca-Cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Lots of bourbon on the nose and tongue. Hides it’s booze well. Solid.\n",
      "Refrigerated 12 oz. squat bottle poured into a  snifter.  Opaque dark brown with small off-white head.  Aroma is caramel, medium body, lower carbonation, and little lacing.  Taste is caramel.\n",

      "355ml can from Boue Ha Ha. Pours an opaque black colour with one finger of light brown head. Aromas of coffee, roasted malts, cacao, vanilla. Taste matches the aroma with roasted coffee bean notes on the finish. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Excellent stout.\n",
      "Spectacular, indulgent and warm and jam-packed with vanilla goodness, sweet without being cloy or syrupy. Starts with a welcoming mix of dark chocolate, vanilla, and caramel—like a liquid Milky Way Midnight—yet the oak, coffee cherry, and bourbon add grown-up depth to the candy bar elements, leading to a whiskey-infused fade. Shocking in its easygoing texture, what with the ABV coming in a hair under 15%. Delicious.\n",
      "Can from Eli. Pours hazy gold with a clinging off-white head and a citrus aroma. There is a near full-bodie pale malt flavor with a lot of citrus and a very bitter finish. Huge flavor.\n",
      "Pours medium amber gold - slightly hazy - brief fizzy white head, receding to ample lacing around the edges. Citrus, biscuit aroma. A lot of body, juicy. Taste citrus - orange and pith dryness with a substantial toasted malt backdrop. Just as the hop/bitter starts to peak, the malt/biscuit emerges to mellow it. It's a nice effect.\n",
      "Sour cherry, biscuit, caramel, hazy brown, sweet with light sourness, caramel, dark fruit,. Flanders weizen.\n",
      "Aroma is mushroom sweet caramel good soy sauce something coffeelike. Taste is mushroom with sweet caramel juice. And some fine bubbled texture. Good.\n",
      "Black pour with a tan head that didn’t last. Powdered chocolate aroma. Taste dark roasted malts powdered chocolate. Creamy marshmallow. Fairly bitter finish. Great brew.\n",
      "Pint can. Pours a murky yellow orange gold with a large white head. Aroma of freshly squeezed oranges, tangerines and Citra hops. Taste is much the same as the aroma. Excellent. Juicy.\n",
      "Bottle. Aroma- fantastic, multidimensional composition of vanilla, red white, figs, dark cherries with subtle caramel and toffee in the background. Subtle alcohol note. Dark brown, a bit hazy, with a low, beige head, which reduces to the ring. Taste- in general feels like a very rich Barley Wine, but it's not so sweet. Vanilla plays very well with red notes (figs, dactyl and some dark berries). Medium-low bodied, quite slim, dry, with a low carbonation. Noticeable, warming alcohol at the end. Very, very elegant and noble Ale. Great stuff.\n",
      "Pint can thanks to Drake! Minor haze, gold, off-white head. Lovely aroma of mango, floral hops, stone fruit, orange peel. Nice flavor of orange peel, tangerine, pine, light pineapple, mango, flroal hops. Very nice.\n",
      "Surprisingly good, just bought it to complete my Trappist list and was positively surprised.\n",

      "355ml can. Clear dark golden with a frothy head. Medium body. Floral, earthy aroma with a hint of spices, pine, citrus, apricot and fresh leaves. Taste has everything in the aroma plus a touch of butterscotch. Sweet with a lovely bitterness on the back end. The flavours come together very well and linger for a long long time, which makes you take a pause before going in for another sip. Just as well, considering the ABV. Quality stuff.\n",
      "Цвет темно-медный. Шапка пены небольшая. Аромат: немного жженки, сухофрукты - слива, инжир, легкие копченые нотки, темная карамель. Вкус: сладковатый, но сбалансированный нотками жженого солода. Послевкусие: легкая копченка и сухофрукты. \n",
      "Итог: отличный представитель стиля доппельбок.\n",
      "In einem Restaurant in DC. Leicht trübes Orange mit einermittleren Schaumkrone.\n",

      "Bitter.\n",
      "330ml bottle into signature Trappist glass. Murky chestnut-brown pour, decent-sized beige head doesn’t last. Complex aroma is caramel, cherries, plums, candy sugar, dark chocolate, sherry-like alcohol, spicy notes. Flavour is medium-sweet, toasty caramel malts, fruitcake, spicy finish with mild alcohol burn, low bitterness. Palate is chewy and fullish, malty, softly carbonated, creamy texture. Nice addition to the Trappist canon.\n",
      "Buona ma troppo luppolata. Per i miei gusti è esagerato il luppolo e alla fine stanca, non la si beve volentieri.\n",
      "16 oz. can shared by Robert via Roger - thanks again, guys! Pours a hazy gold with two fingers of frothy white head that settle into an uneven ring and film while leaving soapy lace in the glass. Notes of melon, doughy malts, herbs, florals, pine resin, and orange citrus. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, bitter, zesty, citrusy mouthfeel in good balance. Well done, and I'll give it just a slight edge over Julius.\n",
      "12oz can x 2. Poured a deep brown with a thinner sized tan head. Vanilla, woody, some dark fruits, chocolate, and some bourbon. Alcohol content well hidden.\n",
      "Bottle.  BB Dec 2027; Drank 31st Dec 2019 - Clear amber brown.  Medium off-white head.  Heavily malted, toasty malts, bready, caramel, toffee.  Dried and citrus fruity, raisins, prunes, dates, orange, marmalade.  Moderate hop bitterness, piney hops, earthy notes.  Rich and smooth.  Quite dry.  Sweet-bitter heavily malted dried and citrus fruity and moderately hoppy.  Enjoyed this.  Good stuff.  Good choice for my last beer of the decade.  (2019-12)\n",
      "375 ml bottle shared by Mark - thanks again, Mark! Pours a clear but very deep maroon-violet with no head, leaving some decent legs in the glass. Notes of rich red and black currants - more red, I'm thinking - with honey, grapes, and cherries. Medium-plus bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, coating, fruity mouthfeel. Awesome stuff. Delicious.\n",

      "Bouteille de 50 CL offerte par Sophie. Robe ambrée sombre et limpide sans mousse. Arômes de fumé, feu de bois, charcuterie sèche, boisés. Texture crémeuse, carbonatation moyenne. Notes de malts grillés, feu de bois, saucisse sèche, boisées, caramel et fruits secs. Finale sèche portée sur le fumé. Un véritable délice.\n",
      "16-Apr-09 (Draft: Chuckanut Brewery & Kitchen in Bellingham, WA)Clean, dry and crisp, this Kolsch offers a the dominant flavor of pleasant, mildly bitter Noble hops backed by a grainy, minimally sweet, pilsener malt flavor.  Overall flavor is light, so this is pretty easy to drink.  Light-bodied and moderately carbonated.  Modestly hoppy and grainy malty aromas, dry, with a touch of straw.  Pale-golden in color with perfect clarity and a small, white head that settles to a wide ring.  A good everyday session lager.\n",
      "Alluring citrus pine aroma in a golden pour.  Hop forward balance dominates the light zesty citrus fruit body right through tothe big bitter finish.  A little one dimensional to my mind.\n",

      "Poured into pint glass.  Dark amber color with frothy head.   First taste was big and bold and I didn’t think I was worthy.  But after a couple drinks this beer keeps you wanting more.   Great beer to enjoy while making dinner.  I will be buying more in the future\n",
      "Lemon-pine nose, some sweet orange notes. Medium body, lots of hop flavors without excessive bitterness. Very slight malty sweetness. Crisp and refreshing. Pleasant bitter finish. Doesn't have the complexity of the great hazy IPAs, but nevertheless, a good drink.\n",

      "Cracking this with two good mates on my 40th birthday as a night cap after a day of solid beer drinking. This big, bad boozy bastard is a huge beer. It’s thick and warming. It’s quite sweet, almost molasses in sickly sweetness. I understand why this is so highly sought after, it’s a great beer and a perfect way to end my 40th birthday. \n",

      "\n",
      "A quick whiff of the top of the 5 oz jigger plainly reveals its cafe espresso history, and a cautious sip consists mainly of cocoa. Further sips show a nice balance of coffee and cocoa, tending more toward cocoa. Very seasonal for January, but contrary to the popular opinion of ratebeerians, it’d take something more to make this beer complex, and I’m not finding it. No doubt my lack! 😉\n",
      "12oz can.  Thick, murky orange body.  Big, foamy, white head.  medium bodied, very easy drinking and refreshing.  Big apple tone, lesser lemon.  Tart up front, smooth sweet finish.  Rather enjoyable for the style.\n",
      "Smells like a wine Black & Mild cigarillo. Heavy notes of vanilla, stewed berries, pipe tobacco, and faint spice. Very sweet, tangy mouthfeel with a bite. Long haunting finish. Crazy good.\n",
      "Canette de 473 ml. Coulleur blanche/blonde avec un joli col blanc. Arômes de banane et d'épices. Goût de céréales grillées, de fruits doux, d'herbes et d'épices. Bonne bière.\n",
      "Accidentally opened when I went to the fridge for food, saw none, and grabbed a beer instead. Bottle courtesy of Drake! Light gold, slightest hint of haze, white head. Dried floral hops, grasses, leaf, and bready aroma. Smooth green and brown leaf, grasses, light cracker. Hint of sweetness in there.\n",
      "Tap at the brewery. \n",
      "Deep red brown with a little head and lace. \n",
      "Aroma is lifted and concentrated. Dried fruit. Aged Vintage Port. Intense, heave yet fresh. \n",
      "Palate is massive. Hint of sweetness yet not dominating. Big structure but not bitter. \n",
      "No hint of sluggish ferments. \n",
      "\n",
      "12.7 oz waxed. Aroma is wood, vegetable soup, Schezwan sauce, chocolate, coconut, sherry. Pours black with a thin tan quickly collapsing head. Taste is highly sweet, never cloying, savory, some tartness, with flavors of chocolate, coconut, toffee, oak. Nothing wrong with the mouthfeel. Tastes a lot better than it smells. Kind of a disappointment overall, but it's not bad at all. Just a bit weird and definitely overrated.\n",
      "Cloudy straw gold with foamy lacy white head\n",
      "Aroma is rich floral hoppy \n",

      "Hoppy, with a funky note. Bitter taste with a citric note. Smooth body. Stronger carbonation.\n",
      "Poured from the tap. Dark brown with beige head. Very nice espresso with mild vanilla and toasted malt. Very good.\n",
      "Got lucky and found this in Indy while wandering on New Years Day. Pours dark brown with a thin khaki head. Strong aroma of sweet dark malt, dark fruit and light booze. Big bold flavor with dark syrup, toffee and light bitterness but leaves a brown sugar sweetness on your lips. ABV is hidden well. Another great version.\n",
      "Can from the brewery. Pours hazy gold with a bubbly white head. Tastes like resin, pine, cereal malt, and some grapefruit. Light/medium body and carbonation. Smells like resin, cereal malt, grapefruit, and pine.\n",
      "Bottle, 2015 vintage. Dark brown color with a red shine, and thick creamy head, slowly disappearing. Aroma is immediately vinous, brandy, berries. taste is a mix of sour and sweet notes, perfectly balanced, vinousfruity, lactic acid. Quite low carbonation, full body, viscous/oily texture. The 13% alcohol is really well hidden, very complex beer but with quite an easy drinkability. Delicious.\n",
      "Appearance: black, little to no head and some lacing. \n",

      "Overall:  suggest to lower the alcohol content, eliminate soy sauce aroma and taste, and improve head and retention.\n",
      "5 week old bottle\n",
      "A: Poured a tall frothy head atop clear deep gold body. Very good retention and busy carbonation leaving thick lacing. \n",
      "S: Light scent. Fruity with citrus and tropical notes. Pine and caramel.\n",
      "T: Much like the nose. Fresh tropicals, melon and citrus pith. Pine and caramel again well in the background. A bit of alcohol in the tart fruity aftertaste.\n",
      "M: Crisp carbonation, thin-ish body and clean finish. Very crushable.\n",
      "O: Very nice. Not a flavor bomb as the flavors are fairly subtle but very well done.\n",
      "Copper colored, small beige head. Aromas of malt, caramel, dried fruit, candi sugar, marmalade and syrup. Taste of malt, sugar, wood, dried fruit, leather, marmalade and slight tobacco.\n",
      "Pour is a thick black with a small tan head that goes away quickly.  Flavor is nice whiskey barrel with maple syrup and tons of coconut.  Flavor is more barrel notes with a nice roast with a little sweet maple syrup with just a ever so slight alcohol note. Not as thick of a mouthfeel as I thought it would have but it still has a nice chewy malt.  Hard to find fault with this beer.  Plenty of barrel and maple syrup notes without being overly heavy or boozy.\n",
      "Excellent beer the only trappist ale produced in the UK rearly enjoyed this will buy again trappist beers are some of the best as the monks know, what there doing when it comes to beer as they have been doing it since the medieval times\n",
      "Crystal malts complementing the hops perfectly having a grassy finish.  Very nice pale ale at a time full of ipas.\n",

      "Golden hazy with a thin head.\n",
      "Smell of exotic fruits with a little funk. Smooth body with a strong grapefruit component. Medium carbonation.\n",
      "Pour is a hazy orange with a white head.  Aroma is pine hops maybe some grapefruit.  Flavor is a slight hop,some chewy malt and a decent pop of bitterness on the end.  Not a big bold exciting beer but this is something expected from the brewer.  Want to take a walk down yesteryear?  This would be for you.\n",

      "Perfectly clear and crisp golden body with the slightest dash of a haze, along with a relatively large and noticeable three to four centimetre tall, pure white head that stays afloat for a long time. Aroma of crisp grass, pine, light malts with some grain and a dash of hay towards the end. Light-bodied; Strong grassy and herbal flavours dominate with a lot of dry malts and some subtle hops along with a touch of sweetness and a clean, very easy-drinking yeast bite towards the end that showcases the malts as well. Aftertaste is pure and clean with the yeast and malt coming out front and centre and the hops not really showing nor any sweetness, graininess or character. Overall, a pretty understated and soft beer, and even though that's what you'd expect from the style, I was thinking that from the brewery you'd get a bit more character and depth, but that isn't the case here - this is easy drinking and a pure Pils without any real class. I sampled this tall, 50 cL (European-Styled) bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Beverly Hills (Los Angeles), California on 26-December-2019 for US$5,99 sampled in my hotel room here in San Diego, California on the turn of the decade on 31-December-2019 to celebrate the New Year and my family's trip to Hawai'i in the morning.\n",

      "12 oz bottle pours an opaque dark brown/black with small tan head that lingers but doesn't leave much lacing.  Aroma has maple syrup, figs, oak, vanilla, and a hint of coffee.  Taste is quite sweet with warming alcohol in the finish.  Body is full with a syrupy but silky, slick mouthfeel.  I'd enjoy this even more if it were not so highly rated or expensive.\n",

      "Amber color beer with a foamy off white head. Big sweet banana pudding nose. Lots of cinnamon spice, bourbon, banana and an almost pina colada flavor. Vanilla ice cream, banana cream pie and cinnamon toast notes. Lots of alcohol, but it works with these flavors. Great dessert beer.\n",
      "Аромат отличный, очень крепкий и приятный, немного цветочных ноток, много цитрусов и кожуры от ней, то есть цедры, немного спелых фруктов вроде манго и персиков. Цвет мутный насколько это возможно. Вкус горький почти по максиму для этого стиля, что бы получать удовольствие. Уже больше цитрусов и меньше фруктов во вкусе. При глотке горчинка немного усиливается. Появляется стойкие и мощные еловые нотки, немного цедры снова вместе с травянистостью. В целом неплохая Нью Ингланд.\n",
      "Very floral and tasty. Has a great nose and a bit  of sourness. A very good offering.\n",
      "Straightforward weissbier, full of bananaclove goodness and a yeasty, lemon-squeeze tartness on the finish. Grassy and bready in the middle, dry and clingy on the fade. Nice.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle at the house. 2018 bottle. Smell sweet malt. Ruby clear in color. Amazing in color. No head. Very sweet. Malty in taste and the sweetness makes this unique tasting. Heavy bodied. Alcohol well hidden. Smooth and there is just a wild sweet aftertaste That’s you don’t find in other beers Just an unusual and a wonderful beer. Cheers!\n",
      "12 ounce can poured into a pint glass. The beer is a clear black with a beige head of foam. Strong roasty notes and a bit of coffee. Earthy and roasty taste. Medium body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Can from David. Golden pour with a white head. Taste is bright and bitter hops. Aroma of bitter grain. Refreshing and sessionable.\n",
      "Bouteille de 341 ml. Couleur noire avec un joli col beige. Arômes de caramel et d'épices fortes. Goût de malt caramélisé, de pain brûlée, de caramel, de mélasse et de fruits rancis. Bonne bière qui frappe fort!\n",
      "The art on the can is what got me to buy. A very good ipa. Bitter hoppy taste but not too strong on the aftertaste.\n",
      "Pours a clear golden with a white head.......aroma is a heavy dose of citrus and pine.....taste is hop forward, citrus hits first then moves to and earthy with a PVC chlorine taste ending in pine and bitterness.\n",
      "12 oz. Bottled about three weeks ago. Aromas of latex, bread, fresh garden peas (:D), pine, caramel. Pours a hazy cantaloupe hue with a fleeting bone white head; collapses into a big-bubbly ring pretty quick. Taste is light to moderately bitter with weird hoppy flavors and faint malt sweetness. Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel. The hop profile here is really weird, but it's strangely good and I keep wanting to take another sip.\n",
      "Pours black into an English pint. Mocha head with little retention recedes to mottle surface. Marshmallow and vanilla aromas. Sweet with vanilla, coconut and molasses front to back.\n",
      "21Dec2019 Fresh, juicy tropical fruits, mango, papaya, passion fruit smoothie. Hazy, milky gold, medium, creamy, white head. Light bitter. More juicy fresh tropical fruits, mango, papaya, passion fruit, zesty tangerine, soft carbonation, medium bodied.Outstanding. Can from radbeer.com.\n",

      "major league hoppy pale. absolute crusher delicious.fresh can from paradise grapevine.\n",
      "16 oz can.  Pours a cloudy golden color and capped by a small off white layer of foam that fades away quickly to a few bubbles and some lace around the glass.  The aroma shows notes of citrus fruits with hints of orange, grapefruit, and melon over a toasted biscuit malt base with hints of resinous pine.  The flavor follows suit with notes of orange, grapefruit, and earthy notes and backed up by the biscuit malts and a firm hop bitterness on the back end with some lingering notes of resinous pine.  Medium bodied and fairly smooth with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and dry citrus on the finish.  Definitely more on the dry and bitter end of the spectrum than the usual juicy IPAs.  Solid and easy drinking IPA that is fairly old school with its level of bitterness.\n",
      "Az óév utolsó söréül választott főzet varázslatos vanília aromáit hordozza magán, mely az olvasztott csokoládé, fagylaltöntet, mályvacukor, karamell és bourbon megnyerő kompozíciójával lép frigyre. Olajos, sűrű és tüzes kortyai a bársonyosság legmagasabb fokán izzanak, magukba forrasztva minden elemet, amely valaha is kapcsolatban állt a csokoládé, konyakmeggy, s természetesen a vanília fenséges, mégsem uralkodó vérvonalával, s amely a hordóban történő érlelés legnagyszerűbb példájaként szolgálhat bármely főzet összetevője számára. Ebben az esetben sem beszélhetünk túlzottan nagy meglepetésről az ital stílusát illetően, a kivitelezés azonban oly mesteri, hogy mindennapi alkalmakon történő fogyasztása szinte szentségtörésnek hathat.\n",
      "12 oz can. Xmas gift from brother Mark. Hazy yellow gold topped by a large frothy white head. Aroma of fresh citrus, apple and cinnamon. Sweet apple and pear flavor upfront. Mildly tart in middle. notes of apple sauce and lemon grass. crisp finish is lightly sweet.\n",
      "Clear amber with a big white head that gives way to lacing. Aroma full of peaches and tropical fruit. Taste a wonderful hop explosion, peaches, mango, apricot, chewy resin, deliciously bitter. Nice soft mouthfeel. Classic.\n",
      "16 oz can.  Pours a hazy golden orange and capped by a small off white layer of foam that settles quickly to a thin film and leaves patches of lace around the glass.  The aroma shows notes of tropical fruits with notes of tangerine, grapefruit, and mango along with some earthy dank notes over a toasted biscuit malt base.  The flavor follows with the tropical fruit notes up front along with some earthy pine and an metallic note as well with a firm bitterness on the back end.  Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and tropical finish with that lingering metallic note.  Something is definitely off with this one and the can is only 3 weeks old.  Disappointed as I had high hopes for this one.\n",
      "Slightly hazy pale gold, white head. Aroma of pine and citrus. Taste citrus lemon, hint of resin. A very nice IPA.\n",
      "375 ml bottle, batch No. 005. Unclear orange, small foamy head. A lot of brett, lime, fresh red currant, cabbage, basement notes, white balsamico vinegar, tart, green apples, white pepper, wine grapes. Dry acidic sourness. Full bodied, oily texture, lively carbonated, dry sour finish. Great!\n",

      "\n",
      "Six-pack of 12 ouncers, bottled 11/27/2019. Mostly clear, brassy gold beer with a disc of meringue on top. Nose of lemon, biscuit, caramel and a whiff of grass. Flavors of the same mix, plus pine resin and a touch of citrus zest. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body. Easy drinker with a clean and crisp taste.\n",
      "Opaque black beer with a slight brown/darl brown head. Medium/heavy aroma; taste starts heavy sweet and ends slightly bitter and dry. Coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate and roasted malts. Blend 2. 8/5/10/5\n",
      "Big old coffee and leather hit with a whack of dark chocolate. Smooth as you like. Good shit.\n",
      "On tap at Muted Horn, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out grassy notes, light herbal character, straw, and biscuity malt. Flavour is clean and drinkable, with grassy notes, herbal notes, straw, and sweet cereal malt. Lots of clarity and well-balanced. Very nice.\n",
      "Can: Aroma is roasted malt with cacao, coffee and chocolate. Black color, low head. Flavor is full of dark chocolate, cacao, some coffee, roasted malt, some dark fruits. Ends roasty bitter with burnt cacao. Very intensive stout with nice chocolate notes.\n",

      "Pours hazy amber orange with a fast-fading off white head that leaves just a rim and coating. Aroma is dank jungle citrus. Taste brings the sweet funk - and a hoppy bitterness out the back. Nice crisp-biscuit malt backbone. Moderate carbonation; cloying and somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter and sticky. Not too boozy. Very good but I prefer a bit more fruit these days.\n",
      "75cl bottle at home, bought in Mikkeller Webshop. Appearance: hazy light straw with medium sized white head.  Aroma: grassy, wild, white pepper, brett, lemon juice, touch of funk even. Taste: medium sweetness and bitterness. Pretty wild en lemony with notes of grass, slight spiciness, some funk. Palate: medium bodied, oily texture and lively carbonation. Overall: best farmhouse ale I’ve had so far. Enjoyable and complex.\n",
      "Pours black with an awesome reddish head and develops after the pour is complete.  The nose is overpowering whiskey and mild oak and roasted malt.  The taste isn't very sweet, which in this case is unfortunate since its needed to cut the alcohol flavor.  As it is, oak and whiskey clearly dominate, while minor chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt do come through as well.  Long and heavy oak finish.  Full bodied and thick in texture.  All of the oak and whiskey didn't agree with me.  I though I would like this much more, but instead its a colossal disappointment.\n",
      "Bottle from Beers Of Europe.\n",
      "Pours a very dark mahogany colour with a fast dissipating beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, dry dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, coffee, cherries, brown bread and brown sugar. Taste is the same notes as the aroma and very full flavoured. Full bodied with a lovely thick chewy mouthfeel. Very moreish for the strength. One of my favourite bocks. Great beer. Delicious!\n",
      "75cl bottle split with SimonBlok and Richardvv. Courtesy of SimonBlok. Pours a hazy pale yellow colour with a rapidly receding white head. Aroma of citrus, peach, slight vanilla, wheat, yeast. Taste is moderate sweet, medium bitter with a moderate dry and sour finish. Notes of pale malt, wheat, floral, yeast, slight citrus. Texture is oily to watery, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation.\n",
      "Brilliant white tight creamy head stayed all the way on a murky marmalade coloured still body.\n",
      "Pomegranate, yeast & orange aroma.\n",
      "Full bodied, thick, greasy & oily with a sticky back.\n",
      "Sweet orange, heavy yeast, pomegranate, sugar, chalk & spice tastes.\n",
      "Bottle from trade. Pours black with very brief head. Deep bitter chocolate, tobacco, toasted grains, wee bit candi sugar. Some alcohol heat. Quite old school heavy hitter. Intense.\n",
      "Tap at new bohemia golden valley. Black with small off white head.  Roasty nose.  Taste is sweet, roast, chocolate,  milk sugar,  nice balance at the finish.  Nice.\n",
      "2018 edition.  Pours black with a medium tan head.  The aroma is an assault of vanilla, then chocolate, fudge, licorice, and mild roasted malt.  This one is sweet.  The flavor of vanilla is strong as expected, but it isn't overwhelming like it was in the nose.  Whiskey, and oak are distinct, chocolate comes through later on in the sip, there are traces of licorice, and some roasted malt.  A quick sharp aftertaste is vanilla with a touch of whiskey.  Its medium to full in body and has a smooth, creamy texture.  Despite a mild whiskey burn, this one isn't as intense as other Bourbon County offerings.  It much smoother and easier drinking.  All told, this is a wonderful beer.\n",
      "Like the flavor of the hops and the light Carmel background of the grain to balance the bitterness. Didn’t care for the flavor of what is believed to be rye.\n",
      "Bottle order from the lcbo. Thick syrupy sweet imperial with boozy bourbon hit. Oakiness, chocolate and coffee, and a little vanilla in the finish. Little sweeter than I would have expected. It's quite good, though it tough to compete with the hype.\n",
      "Bottle shred at tilt, bingoham shn. A jet black coloured pour with a halo of dark tan head. Aroma is sweet black malts, liquorice, brandy snap, Warming alcohol, peanut. Flavour is composed of thick chewy, black malts, meaty roast, liquorice, bacon, brown sugars, light tang. Palate is medium sweet, Sticky rounded, moderate carbonation.\n",
      "A kávé alkalmazásához egy barley wine esetében csak abban az esetben nem közeledek idegenkedve és fenntartásokkal, ha azt egy Goose Island kvalitású főzde teszi egy Bourbon County-hoz mérhető színvonallal megáldott keretbe ágyazva. A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az \"imperial\" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival. Ebben az esetben tehát az ízek befogadhatatlanul sokszínű jellegéhez egy intenzív, mégis a kompozícióba kívánkozó karakter csatlakozik a kávé személyében, így téve megismételhetetlenül egyedivé az eleve speciális, önmagában sem mindennapi főzetet.\n",

      "Bár még csak egy alkalommal volt szerencsém a legendához, a Bourbon County-sorozattal már akkor életre szóló barátságot kötöttem, a sörfőzés ilyen szintű magasfoka mellett egyszerűen nem lehet úgy elmenni, hogy az ember ne arra gondoljon, magát az etalont kóstolgatja éppen, amikor a Goose Island örökbecsű darabjait ízleli meg. Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban. A legnemesebb tölgyes, fahordós, whiskyben ázó dohányleveles, bőrszerű, őszi faleveles aromák, amihez kékvérű test bársonyos, csillogó jegyei társulnak, a maguk ezerszínű palástját felöltve, melyet órákig csodálhatunk, betelni mégsem tudunk vele. Az aromák folyékony halmazállapotba kerülve konyakmeggy, vanília, bourbon, csipkebogyólekvár és füstös eperdzsem varázslatos keverékét adják, melyet angolszász stílusban közvetítenek, teret engedve azonban minden elem vibrálásának, így téve lehetővé végtelennek tetsző részletességű komponenseinek érvényesülését, melyek egyenként is művészi értékkel bírnak. Csodálatos barley wine, valóban nem a mindennapok itala, örömömre szolgál, hogy megfelelő időzítéssel döntöttem az elfogyasztása mellett.\n",

      "amazing stout with great oak and bourbon and chocolate character.Great vanilla notes\n",
      "Quite a firm and herbal, spicy tripel - it really says \"I'm here\". Complex, full body, yet well balanced. A bit dry. A really good tripel that draws your attention with every nip!\n",
      "En klassiker, en bra lager. Trevligt besk men ändå relativt lätt drucken. Fungerar till mat så som vid en trevlig utgång.\n",
      ".75 bottle  pale golden hazy. Pretty nice sharp citrus on nose, meadows, florals, bit wit-like actually, but with a dupondy dirt dusty straw maltyness. Med bodied, med tart, really clean, citrus, piercing lemon peely finish. Right ok.\n",
      "Can @ Nusser. Aroma of roasted malt, Maple, chocolate, nuts cinnamon, coffee, lacto. Complex but balanced. Moderate sweet and bitter with lingering roasted notes. Full and creamy. Great...\n",
      "Can. It pours opaque black with a creamy dark tan head. The aroma is roasted malty with notes of light cinnamon, rich chocolate, vanilla and light nuts. Wow! The flavor is lacto sweet with some bitter roasted notes. Formidable.\n",
      "Deep reddish brown colour.  smooth full body malt flavour Dubbel as expected for a good Belgian Trappist, however it’s just not worth the extra cost as a Leffe Brune at half the price is as good in my opinion.\n",
      "Botella de 335 ml @ Saveur Biere online store. Color negro, aspecto denso y oleoso. Espuma marrón. Buena retención. \n",
      "Aromas a vainilla, torrefactos, cacao, licor. Sabor complejo, dulzón al principio con notas a chocolate, vainilla. Después se vuelve más astrigente, notas a chocolate negro, café, licor. Final persistente y equilibrado.\n",
      "Bouteille 750ml. Couleur orangée trouble, mousse blanche tenace. Arôme de clémentine, levure, fermier, poivré. Goût de levure poivrée, malt, amertume moyenne-élevée. Carbonatation élevée, corps moyen.\n",
      "Bottle. Murky brown/ Notes of dark fruits, earth, burnt toffee. Very complex barrel aged character. I wasn’t hugely impressed with the first iteration of this beer so was pleasantly surprised with how good this was.\n",
      "Bottle from Beergium shared, pours brown reddish color. Aroma of dark fruits, plums, maltiness, vanilla, caramel, toffee bourbon, oak notes and quite a lot of alcohol. Almost full body, medium bitterness. Complex sweet aroma, a lot of warming alcohol, and just a heavy hitting beer overall, which isn't a surprise. Dryish alcoholy aftertaste. Boozy ale overall, with a lot of maltiness and sweetness, but still a well balanced beer if the alcohol doesn't turn you off, as it fits the criteria here quite nicely.\n",
      "Can. An unlcear yellow colored beer with a nice white head. A bit boring aroma, piney and grapefruity, with a light malty touch. Dry and medium bodied, with a soft carbonation and a pleasant bitterness. Pale malts, grapefruit and pine cones in the flavor. Rather chalky. Short finish. An easy drinkable one, but a tad boring. 191231\n",
      "473 ml can.\n",
      "Pours clear golden color with a small white head. Peachy and lactic aroma, some vanilla notes, toffee and caramel. Flavor is sweet with toffee, vanilla notes, toasted malts, very faint spice notes. Not particularly enjoyable mixture but not a complete failure either.\n",
      "4224\n",
      "Pretty hoppy for  Doppelbock but that's how they \"kick it up a notch\" on the West Coast, I'm told. Can. Clear pale gold with a white head. Aroma of tenor register citrus - kumquat, mandarin, cooked grapefruit, some pine and tropical fruit. Ooozy with a top end. Pretty light bodied. Some hayish malts are almost enough to support the aromatics. Lovely citrus, resin and some herbal notes build towards the strongly bitter end. Good (but one can is enough).\n",
      "Can at a tasting. Opaque black color, beige head. Aroma is roasted, grassy, piney, black coffee.  Sweetish, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, piney, caramel, citric, dry bitter finish.  Medium-bodied, smooth. Great stuff.\n",

      "Nera, testa nocciola a grana irregolare e dalla veloce evanescenza. Profumo di malto tostato, caffè, cacao, legno e bourbon. Scaldandosi emergono sentori di frutta scura e un accenno di vaniglia. Al palato si ripresenta in toto il bouquet aromatico. Il finale è cenere, tabacco, liquirizia e con una corposa luppolatura resinosa. Retrogusto alcolico di bourbon invecchiato. Corpo pieno e bassa carbonazione. Birra molto bilanciata ed estremamente pulita.\n",

      "From a 650ml bottle on 31/12/2019 (2014 edition, shared by Butz with thanks). Smells of oak and dark fruit, with a bit of smoke. This is a complex beast - chocolate, cherry, smoke, licorice and bourbon. There's some red wine, oak and booze to make it very much a sipper. The palate is viscous, the carbonation softish. Undeniably high quality stuff, though perhaps not my thing style wise.\n",

The nose features some light chocolate and a lot of oak and whiskey. Flavour wise, it's very sweet up front with the cocoa prevalent, along with some cherry. It finishes with lots of warming booze. Definitely drinks every bit of its 13.6%. Quite light bodied for such a big beer. The mouthfeel is a touch oily and the carbonation softish. A lovely dessertish, boozy sipper.\n",

      "Bottle. Poured hazy golden color with a medium sized head. Dank (but not as much as name would imply), fruity, citrus, and some sweet caramel.\n",
      "2008 (at the tail end of 2019) poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Cognac colored with no head (SLOW pour to avoid sediment). Aroma is merlot, oak, dark fruits, sweet bread, caramel malt. Initial taste is oaky, earthy, merlot, fading into a light malty sweetness. Slick palate and next to no carbonation. Seriously good stuff. I can't wait to see what another 10-15 years does for the other bottle in my cellar.\n",
      "16oz can. Poured a hazy golden color with a medium sized head. Toasted grains, citrus, floral and grass. I'm not crazy about session IPAs, but this was good.\n",
      "Bottle from Brou Ha Ha, Gatineau, Quebec. Pours an opaque black colour with minimal head that dissipates quickly and leaves a small film that lingers. Strong bourbon/brandy aroma on the nose with some oak notes. Complex taste mirrors the aroma with a sweet malty backbone, chocolate notes on the finish. Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. High alcohol content is well concealed. Overall an all around excellent brew. Highly recommended if you are into dark beers.\n",
      "0,33l bottle. Pours amber with off-white head. Aroma of malt, honey, caramel, fruits. Taste is malty, honey, stone fruit, caramel, toffee. Very sweet, yet enjoyable.\n",
      "12 oz can from Half Time. Pale golden, hazy, huge towering head. Grainy aroma with some citrus peel. Taste brings more citrus, floral flavors, dry, tangy, light bitterness. Seemingly light but packs a wallop in the hop department.\n",
      "16 oz. Canned about nine weeks ago. This batch is 6.5% ABV with 50 IBUs. Aroma is peachy, Smarties, orange creamsicle, citrus peel. Pours a hazy cantaloupe-orange with a one finger bone-white head with decent retention. Taste is moderately sweet and only lightly bitter. Perfectly carbonated creamy mouthfeel. Nice beer.\n",
      "Notes: Keg, 7/Apr/19. $12 for a plastic cup. 6.9% abv. Had with Maxwell Hianaese Chicken Rice. Last meal for holiday #2 in SG. \n",

      "One of the remaining beers I picked up  in Ft. Worth over the Thanksgiving holiday, I am ready to have a taste.  I do like berries, let us see how it translates to a brew.  My Great Heights snifter from Houston is out for this one.  I lift the lid off the 12 oz bottle and the scent fills the air, very fruity indeed with some chocolate, interesting.  The pour is cinnamon brown completed by a eggshell-white rim of foam around the glass. A taste now, wow, a lot of flavor here. It's like a slice of berry pie, what kind I cannot say. Tart veering to sour, I am not put off by that.  And I do get the presence of alcohol, 16.5% is hard to cover up. A lot going on here, mostly good.\n",
      "Waxed bottle. Poured a near black color with a medium sized tan head. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, oaky, strong and warming ... sipper and I'll sit on my other bottle for a few years.\n",
      "1/3 pint (4%) on tap on 30 Dec 2019: fruity, tropical fruits aroma, hazy golden, thin short-lived head, very sparse lacing,  passionfruit, mango flavour, oily, soft carbonation, sweet fruity finish.\n",
      "Clementine soap yeast funk founder wood barrel wood light cheese oak vanilla. Amazing.\n",
      "2019/12/30 - Pours deep dark brown with a foamy light tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is amazing; decadent dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, loads of coconut, roasted coffee and nutty notes. Like kahlua. Taste is sweet dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, roasted coffee, toasted malts, oak, bourbon and nuts. Mouthfeel is medium and oily with smooth carbonation and a sweet, dry, lightly warming finish. Awesome stuff.\n",
      "Coffee stout by this rising star in the English craft beer firmament, thanks to Craftmember for sharing.  Creamy, mocha-beige, dense and stable, thick head on a black beer with thin mahogany edge.  Aroma of coffee cream, mocha ice cream, caramel candy, 'Haagse hopjes', candied figs, ground pecan nuts, cold cappuccino.  Rounded onset, quite restrained in sweetness especially for a postmodern coffee stout, hints of dried fig, medlar and fried pear, softish carb, creamy and soft, even somewhat silky mouthfeel.  Pecan-nutty, caramelly and black-toasty maltiness, bittersweet with more bitterness than sweetness, remaining altogether quite dry, with the roasty side enhanced by softly bittering coffee - which does, in the end, provide a strong retronasal aroma highlighted by some warming, gin-like alcohol and a peppery hop bitter note.  Hard caramel- and cappuccino-like aspects linger.  Soft, creamy and drier than expected, this is a somewhat distinct, but in many aspects great coffee stout, though hardly the best stout in Europe...  Still quite a special one indeed, but in a subtle and indirect manner that not all the geeks will pick up, I think.\n",

      "75CL, acquired in 2014 and forgot I had it. Finally opening February of 2020. \"will age for decades\" so let's see :) Dark reddish color, had a 7-up kind of carbonation when I poured it. can smell sweet syrupy brandy from a few feet away. maple syrup, baked apples and cinnamon aroma. wow, this has blended and aged so well. soggy oak, burnt sugar, vanilla, bible paper, ice cream, candied sugar and more apple. little bits of cherry and lovely smokey flavor with an oily grain alcohol finish. Easily the best of the anniversary beers.\n",
      "Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.\n",
      "Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. \n",

      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",

      "750-ml caged and corked bottle purchased at the brewery in Brossard, Quebec, Canada. Pours pitch black yet with the tiniest bit of mahogany hightlights, along with a trace of brown head and lots of clingy lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate, dark dried fruits, smoke. Flavor: espresso, milk chocolate, campfire marshmallows, prunes, raisin bread, date bars, figs, molasses cookies, burnt toast; perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel: full-bodied with a velvety smooth, creamy yet oily finish.\n",
      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours black-brown with a foamy, beige head. Luxurious and delicious, with lots of layered chocolate character, a bit of chocolate sauce, ripening dark fruits, subtle roast, creamy-sugary coffee. Full bodied, oily and lightly chewy, with fine carbonation. Softly warming finish, almost a little sticky, more more decadent chocolate character, raisins, mellow earthy bitterness, more dense fresh coffee. Has an obscene amount of depth. Makes for a great sipper. Delicious.\n",
      "\"il solito\" al pub che frequento di più era la Beamish. Una birra che non ti stanca mai, leggera di gradazione, dissetante, ne berresti litri!\n",
      "Ottima stout Irlandese \"caffelattosa\", con schiuma spumosa (spillatura ad azoto).\n",
      "Per il mio gusto, superiore alla \"sorella\" ben più famosa e diffusa.\n",
      "Absolutely delicious. The hoppiness of Torpedo is toned down, but the results are oh so fascinating once this subdued IPA bitterness is coupled with generous barrel aging. The bourbon notes provide a lovely baseline, while subtle grapefruit, orange, and pine notes play off the vanilla and wood from the barrel. Texture's dreamy in its supple smooth feel; ABV's a nonfactor. Just a frickin' amazing beer.\n",
      "3.5 yrs aged. Black pour with a foamy thin tan head. Rich darkly sweet aroma with notes of brandy and plum and raisin and dates. Hints of roast malt and blackberry. Big dark boozy flavor with notes of charred barrel, dates, brandy, blackberries, and a little bittersweet dark cocoa. Lingering roasty and gently earthy finish.\n",
      "Had on tap at Tenaya Creek, this was delicious. Quite hazy, a ton of grapefruit flavors with a little orange.  This is the Stone quality I remember but had been missing in some recent average beers. This one is top notch! Tasty tasty.\n",
      "An American Lager with no bitter aftertaste. Clean but not overpowering Lemon and Ginger flavor. A Light & Crisp finish. Doesn't weigh you down. Perfect for a warm afternoon or just relaxing at home or with your friends. High Recommended if you are an America Lager Fan.\n",

All lactic/acetic.  Complex dark red wine flavors with the dark fruits are great.  Really delicious and complex.\n",
      "This one was surprising to me.  It's essentially the perfect sessionable Belgian styled amber ale. Awesome spicy Belgian yeast backed by strong caramel malt is the main flavor and aroma component. A nip of raisin and cotton candy. Lightly sweet, very malty, but well in balance. This would pair with any pub grub. Nice substantial chewy mouthfeel that lightens as it fades. A modern masterpiece from the only Trappist brewery in North America. Impressive.\n",

      "A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate. The results speak for themselves as this world class imperial stout delivers a product worth traveling or trading for.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!\n",

      "deep rich stout. not super overwhelming either for 12% rich chocolate darkfruit flavors, a little woody, very thick and oily. just overall tasty stuff.\n",
      "First of all, boozy af. You can really taste the bourbon. Along with that is vanilla and an earthiness I associate with fresh tobacco. A dark, complex beer that you practically need to chew, the mouthfeel is so thick and smooth, like a Dove bar. One of my absolute favs, though I cant handle more that about 8oz at a time - that ABV is no joke\n",
      "It's good. No unwanted tastes or flavors that I notice. 15 pack for $14.50 before tax.\n",

      "The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.\n",

      "750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!\n",
      "Found at El Tap in San Juan. Burgundy in color. Lots of cherry flavor. Intense sour.\n",
      "Sierra Nebmvada really knows how to celebrate an anniversary. Their 40th IPA is truly a victory of brewing. It's a balanced affair that channels their west coast pedigree while still delivering interest and quality. A solid light malt backbone lifts an impressive resiny piney hop bill that is both familiar and engaging at the same time.  Nice long hoppy finish that still manages to avoid rindiness. Quite clean. Awesome lacing too. This is why they are the west coast kings.\n",
      "Semmi hab, vöröses árnyalatú fekete szín. Kávés, kakaós, paprikás illat, aszalt gyümölcsös és némi vaníliás beütéssel. Kakaóporos, kávés, aszalt gyümölcsös ízek, vaníliás, paprikás aromákkal, és a whiskey-s hordó enyhe fás fanyarságával. Enyhén édes, testes, jelzés értékű szénsavval, közepes keserűvel. Nehézsúlyú versenyző, tökéletes egyensúllyal. Isteni.\n",

      "Aroma : Massive sweet black cherry hit with some espresso coffee & hint of dark chocolate maltiness.  Taste : Black Cherry sweetness is balanced by bitterness from deep roasted (almost burnt) chocolate malt & espresso coffee. Body is heavy and mouthfeel slightly oily. Absolutley fabulous...not just best beer had in Florida tour (Nov 2018), but one of the best I've ever had!\n",

      "This is a heavy hitter. %10 IPA VERY hoppy but the aroma is the most inviting thing. Taste isn exceptional and almost deceiving for such a high percentage. Notes of eccentric citrus and bitter but not to the point of undrinkable. You really have to take your time with it and allow your pallet to have a break in between sips to really appreciate what it has to offer.\n",
      "Wow this is damn good. Right away when I opened the can I could smell tropical fruits for days and the taste didn't disappoint neither. Packed with tropical fruits such as mango, papaya, passion fruit and in come the peaches and honey dew melon. This is world class IPA!\n",
      "One of the old guard of American craft brewers, Ommegang's artful delivery of Belgian styles is truly on par with many of the European MVPs that served as their influence. Hennepin is, dare I say, ever but as good, and perhaps better than Saison Du Pont, THE saison. Hennepin's deep golden body floats a thick even bubbled white head that leaves plenty of lacing behind with each swallow. Toasted malt, honey, orange, meadow flower, ginger and white peppercorn dance in a complex melange that shifts and changes with each sip. Mildly sweet as it fades, spicy hops dart in and out, piquing the palate with earthy, herbal goodness. The carbonation is fairly high, but not overdone or brittle. A modern classic.\n",
      "Pure peanut butter aroma, well chocolatey, cocoa, pitch black, sweet chocolate, 20% cocoa, very very nutty, thick, creamy, so smooth, incredibly drinkable, abv feels around 8%, just amazing brew. Tidy bit too sweet, but that's just personal preference.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. Rounding out the set of 4 Berry White meads we sampled. This, like the others, was fantastic. Sweet, honey, tart berry, fruity, hints of chocolate.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. This was my favorite of the 4 Berry White's we sampled. Sweet, earthy blueberry, hints of chocolate. Crazy good.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. This was unbelievable. Strawberry, honey, sweet, and rich. So good!\n",
      "I'm not sure how you rate this beer less than 5. I understand tastes vary, but this is defines the style. Perfectly balanced. Delicious.\n",
      "I have been sampling many imperial stouts recently. Rasputin rises to the top. No extra flavorings, and all the better for it. Perfectly balanced and delicious. I know that tastes are personal, but the malt, hop and carbonation balance are perfect, and the alcohol level is high but doesn't totally overwhelm.\n",
      "Hazy purple pour with a small violet head. Aroma has vanilla and blueberry along with a sweet pastry. Taste is amazing, with blueberry, mild cherry, and a sweet cheese danish pastry. Absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet. Not overly tart. Perfection.\n",

      "Attained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Dia de Los Mangos is a Belgian-style sour ale fermented and aged in oak barrels with mango, tamarind, and chili crafted by Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of chilis and mango are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 6.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancho chili greets you with a sweet spice on the take. Aleppo chili follows with a cayenne touch. Guajillo chili adds a smoky, berry like hue to the chili feel. Serrano chili provides a sharp earthy spice that deepens as the finish prolongs. Mango fairly sweetens the complexion, smooths the take, and slightly weighs the drink. Yellow chili assists with the sweet mango. A barnyard funk is notable with the juicy mango. Tamarind is vibrant in the earthy spice and lactic finish. Oak is sensible with the aleppo and guajillo chili characters. The chilis are tasted and felt when you licked your chops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dia de Los Mangos is a stunning Belgian-style sour ale. The bouquet of ancho, aleppo, yellow, guajillo, and serrano chilis along with tart tamarind and lactic yeast makes this beer a one of a kind. The mango makes this brew drinkable. The aleppo, guajillo, and serrano chilis ravishes the drink yet colorful. Tamarind, mangos, and ancho and yellow chilis provides a wonderful sweet tone. This is a spicy beer, yet it is pleasing for me but I have mention that I like my salsa hot and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this craft beer and enamored by the chili profile.\n",

Flavor yields roast malt, molasses, bourbon, woody, sweet chocolate, quality coffee and subtle earthy notes for a superb stout. Texture presents firm body, peppy fizz, and a satisfying dark finish. Plumb these depths!\n",

      "Vintage 2016. Bottle from the VI Warsaw Beer Festiwal almost three years ago. The last bottle on this Festival. Lambic z mocno musujacym efektem, piany jest sporo, nawet wiecej niz wirusow w Chinach, do tego trwala ze monety mozna na niej ukladac. Mocno metne, pod koniec tak metne i brudne ze barwa byla jak capucino z ekspresu. Doskonaly aromat zielonej salaty, rukoli, agrestu i tych kasztanow wlasnie, tak to mi sie kojarzylo z dziecinstwa, gdy chodzilem do szkoly przy drodze roslo drzewo z ktorego spadaly kasztany w zielonej skorce, lekko pekaly, nie wszystkie i kiedy podnioslem i powachalem wlasnie taki zapach czulem. Co do smaku to jest mega kwasno, nawet porzadnie chmielno, (jak na Lambic to zadki przypadek) wytrawne klimaty, zielony kwasny i nie dojrzaly agrest,, biale winogrona i wytrawne biale wino. doskonaly lambic, nieco inny, ale jak ze przez to ciekawy. polecam zwlaszcza do sera Roquefort. po prostu bajka...z kasztanowymi drzewami... Bezcenne chwile.\n",
      "0,65 l bottle from Systembolaget Gothenburg. 0,65 l bottle and 11,8% is big deal. Beer was superb, thanks.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Slightly ruddy very dark brown pour, practically black in the glass, with a very large yet very swiftly disintegrating head. Very prominent coffee aroma, with lurking sweetness. Thick, slick, smooth and chocolatey-sweet, with next to no carbonation. The fenugreek does indeed lend a herbal-cum-maple syrup effect to the beer as claimed, to go alongside the (lightly supported by hazelnut and vanilla) chocolate syrup. Coffee notes, however, develop primarily in the aftertaste. Absolutely gorgeous Imperial Stout, albeit (and perhaps because of being) totally unchallenging. 10% beer should not be this damn easy to drink! However, although it's powerful and delicious, from a strict artistic standpoint I'd like to see more depth and complexity from a double-digit ABV beer - which might also have served to keep the fenugreek in check; if there's any complaint I have with this it's that it's just a little more 'herbal' than I'd have made it. Still, this rates very, very highly. By far the easiest-drinking Imperial Stout I've tasted - might not bring all the richness and complexity some fans of the style are looking for, however, it's certainly not generic!\n",
      "from a 12oz bottle to a Sierra Nevada branded pint glass\n",
      "Appearance: pours deep golden with a 3/4\" thick perfectly white head with above average retention. this beer has almost 100% clarity. excellent lacing was observed.\n",

      "Taste: excellent balance of bready, slightly sweet malts and assertive hop bitterness. \n",
      "Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. oily, rich texture. subdued astringency and crisp carbonation. Finish is extra smooth with a lingering (and slowly descending) bitterness.\n",
      "Overall: Sierra Nevada at what they do best! this is a beer from another era. reminds one of those early early IPAs from the 90s. I love it.\n",
      "Had on draft at Lost Abbey tasting room. Pours cloudy gold with medium/small head.  A bit cool at first, as it warms Bretta aroma  goes from subtle to up front. Light body beer. Flavor is light a little tart, faint hops, with Brett at the finish and aftertaste. Fantastic session beer.\n",
      "12 ounce, bottled 11/19/2019. Deep ebony brew with an enduring film of creamy brown foam. Nose is chocolate, caramel, bread pudding, vanilla and a touch of bourbon. Front flavor start the same, turns to chocolate cookie dough and whiskey in the middle, then finishes with toasted barrel, maple, chocolate torte and coffee. Heavy bodied with smooth, low-medium fizz and a definite sweet slant, but never cloy. Dangerously drinkable dessert beer.\n",
      "Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of intense notes of chocolate mix in with some maple syrup and bourbon with vanilla notes also noticeable. Taste is also a mix of sweet chocolate notes, maple syrup with some woody notes, bourbon and vanilla notes also perceptible. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with some light warming alcohol notes. World-class imperial stout from a great brewery.\n",
      "Nera con testa ebano pannosa e persistente. Al naso, cioccolato al latte, caffè, note tostate, prugna, ciliegie, luppolo, spirito.  Al palato c’è il dolce del cioccolato e della melassa, malto, tiramisù, poi arriva il tabacco, legno, liquirizia e le tostature di orzo e caffè a bilanciare la bevuta. \n",
      "Retrogusto con scia di cioccolato fondente con leggera nota di vaniglia e generosissimo finale amaricante e resinoso del luppolo. Retrogusto quasi polveroso. Abbraccio etilico non indifferente sempre presente ma non invadente. Corpo enorme, masticabile, vellutato, carbonazione molto bassa. Birra impegnativa, mastodontica, eccessiva ma fatta con cuore e maestria\n",

Flavour of whisky, smoked ham, dates, ash and tobacco. Warming alcohol in the end. Has a silky mouth feel, full-bodied and a light bitterness. A perfect match between a barley wine and whisky. Incredibly balanced and pleasant to drink. Smoked and sweet and a little bitterness to balanced it. Just wow!\n",

Gusto a malta tostada, caramelo, vino blanco, cognac, madera, fruta confitada, pomelo, mermelada de naranja amarga y un punto especiado. Cuerpo medio. Un cerveza de lo más complejo que he probado en mi bida, que pasada, voy a intentar cada año hacerme con una edición Vintage porque son lo más, brutalísima.\n",

Rich flavor yields dark chocolate, coffee, roast malt, molasses, toffee and a bit of piney hops - this is a liquid candy bar! Texture offers heavy, viscous body and lively fizz that lasts. Go on the assault! I love the artwork on the can; the cat looks a lot like Helena, a cat I had to give up when I moved recently. :( At least she's happy in her new home.\n",

      "Golden clear with a very thin head.\n",
      "Grassy smell with a hint of molasses. Rich lager taste, satisfyingly malty with an agreeable, but pronounced, bitterness. The body's richness is accentuated by a fine but mouthfilling carbonation.\n",
      "This is a very well made lager beer. I won't say anymore Americans can't brew a good lager.\n",
      "Four friends - kernel iteration. Bottle share at Beer Merchants Tap. Aroma is intense apricot, nectarine - beautiful potent mixed stone fruits. Taste is again the same just juicy stone fruit and a funky dryness and acidity pulling through the fruit. So juicy and lovely. Great drinkability yet complex. Moderate acidity lingers. Outrageously good and the best of the set in my opinion.\n",

Ginger is distinguishable in the finish at the back of the throat. Honey adds tone to the drink and tasted when you lick your chops. Wheat grains the mouthfeel and accompanies the pear and honey notes.\n",

      "Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a delightful gose. Quince, rhubarb, coriander, and honey combine into a beautiful bouquet.

The centerfolds of pear like quince and green apple like rhubarb harmonizes magnificently. I treasured each drink and impressed by its colorful array of flavors.\n",

      "On tap self-pour at Whole Foods/Tysons, VA.  This reminded me of one of my top rated beers....North Coast Old Stock Cellar Reserve.   That one was 14%, so this is a toned down smoother version of that.    Didn't know at first it was a blend of imperial stout and barleywine, so that definitely explains the heavy malty notes.  The bourbon is there for sure, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  Smooth, semi-creamy texture. Medium to dark brown appearance with light cream colored head.  Going to look for a 4-pack of this.\n",

This is what God intended as the standard for great beer.  Tripel with bourbon barrel aging.   This is as close to perfection as I've tasted in my long beer rating.  These kind of beers do not come along often.  Pretty close to perfection.\n",
      "(2019 KBS) Pours pitch black and with a tan head. Noticeably smells of boozy and lovely bourbon with some vanilla and coffee beans. First tastes that come through are pleasant coffee and then a nice wave of bourbon comes through before finishing with semi-sweet chocolate. The ending hop presence is a nice addition and gives it some dry bitterness (in a good way). Very smooth given the ABV.\n",

Amazing flavor that’s dark English toasty malts with lots of oak and sublime bourbon flavors. Complex and bourbonny with a lingering toasted oak flavor.\n",
      "On tap at City Beer new location.  Pungent aromas of citrus hops with honey, pear, lemon, floral scents. I don't know if it is the hops in this beer, but it is great.  Maybe it's the malts.  Really enjoying this.  Nice first beer at an excellent place.\n",

      "2012 Vintage. Dark reddish brown pou. Cloudy throughout. No head to speak of. This aged old ale is incredibly complex with new elements unfolding with every sip. Strong caramel and saddle leather, some chocolate, and dark cherry battle for position in the aroma. Smoky notes atop the caramel start to appear as I sip. Dark fruits. Some currants. A nip of fennel. The hops are still banging here, with a spicy earthy tone that mingles in and through the complex malt and yeast esters. It drinks light, and the only hint if alcohol comes in the chest,  mid glass and beyond. This is one special beer. This is art.\n",

      "This was great.  Black with mocha head.  Smooth and thick.  Vanilla comes through the most, with light roast (could have bet there was coffee in here too), cocoa, deep malts.  Very nice!\n",
      "Black as my soul with mocha head.  Thick but NO sign of 15.5%, in part because the roasted malts hazelnut and awesome JBM coffee (my personal favorite) obscure the alcohol.  Great great great dessert beer.  4.5-\n",
      "Color negro, opaca. Un dedo de espuma marrón con buena retención. Aroma a malta tostada, café chocolate negro, canela y notas de guindilla. Gusto en la misma línea del aroma, añadiría vainilla y avena, bastante láctea y el chili habanero lo tiene bastante pronunciado. Cuerpo oleoso. Una maravilla de Imperial Stout, la edición anterior tenía la canela mucho más marcada y en esta el habanero manda, obligado su elaboración anual.\n",
      "13.2%ABV.   Imperial stout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tapped out black.  40°SRM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nose has aromas of earth, wood, fire.  There are elements of raw flour, wheat dust, dry hay as well which for me is totally attractive for a stout, which is so rare these days. It’s probably the PB2 that’s giving it the depth of earthy aroma. This is the aroma that suggest wet rotting logs, a compost heap, and fresh turned earth.  The nose has a bit of umami funk that suggest raw soy sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is full and juicy with watered honey.  Low-moderate carbonation.  There is a bit of a carbonic tingle on the palate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Palate has flavors peanut butter and jelly.  There are herbal flavors suggesting licorice and lineament. There is nice base flavor peanut like a nice peanut butter sandwich or a Thai satay peanut sauce.  There are ample roasty flavors that suggest black coffee, espresso, charcoal and burnt ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hop flavors are woody with a hint of pine resin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish is surprisingly brief and clean with a hint of umami that suggests dashi, bonito flakes or soy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a big complex imperial stout that’s not like any other peanut butter concoction. This iteration seems to have gone umami, funky, and earthy instead of creamy, sweet, and boring.\n",
      "750 ml bottle from the brewery. Weird to change the blend so dramatically in year 6 of this beer. Pours a deep, dark, inky and basically opaque brown with virtually no head. The liquid leaves thick legs in the glass as it goes down, too. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, dark dried fruits, and molasses. Medium-full bodied, with low to modest carbonation and a sweet, slick, rich, warming, coating mouthfeel in great balance. It's great. Not quite to the level of TWCP Maman but slightly better than previous vintages.\n",
      "Holy hell, what a beer...Cocoa, coffee, vanilla, black cherry, molasses, and anise, backed up by oak, chiles, roast, spice, and a lovely rum warmth. Amazing in its balance, never growing overly sweet or boozy, with a gentle, easygoing texture that would be surprising at 8%, much less friggin’ 15%. Amazing. The best Bomb! of them all. I want more. So much more.\n",
      "Sample at the taproom during Jackie O's XIV Anniversary on 1/11/20. Dark red pour with a medium pink head. Nose of malt, cherry and vanilla. Cherry pie, basically. Malt and cherry flavor leading into vanilla before a sour cherry finish. Really good stuff.\n",
      "Couleur jaune paille bien voilée; au nez, le fruit jaune, mangue, ananas.\n",
      "En bouche, les fruits tropicaux, mange, ananas, c'est légèrement laiteux, avec un picotement dans la gorge qui fait du bien. Une finale piquante sur le fruit qui perdure! Miam délicieux, c'est presque parfait!\n",
      "De Landbierparadies. En vaso de hefe de Bavaria. Viendo Sex Education 2x02-03. Sobresaliente feel, dan ganas de bebersela de un trago. Perfil maltoso muy fresco, con notas herbales y excelente equilibrio dulzor/amargor\n",
      "This stuff is phenomenal. Just working on the last one from my four pack and I'll be going back to get some more. Big sour pineapple and coconut with the milk sugar finishing it out.\n",
      "Dark brown, near black. Strong aroma of roasted coffee beans.  In taste, dominant roast coffee flavour, chocolate, some vanilla,  malt, bitter note, sweetness. Medium carbonation, medium body. Best coffee porter I’ve had.  Surprised to see it’s 9% ABV - can’t taste the alcohol. Smart black and beige can design.\n",
      "Fles 35,5cl thuis. 2019 batch. 11,3%. Zwaar, vol en vet, bourbon, zoet, chocolade, koffietonen, roasted malts, ahornsiroop, boozy, caramel. (26-1-2020).\n",
      "Aroma: Lovely malty smell with sweet notes\n",
      "Appearance: Very dark beer with somewhat of an amber glow, soft foamy head\n",
      "Taste: Nice round balanced flavour with a nice level of hops and sweetness along with some sour fruity tastes\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Very smooth, heavy and creamy\n",
      "Overall: I really can't fault this beer on anything, it's as delicious and iconic as ever from one of the top independent brewers in England. This is real ale within a budget done right. 5/5, no question.\n",
      "Can.  Pours as expected, black velvet with a thin but holding tan head. \n",
      " Rich aromas, and equally alluring warming flavors ... cocoa mostly, dark chocolate, the thinnest of coffee profiles.  Absolutely delicious! \n",

That said, I just threw down 200 bucks on 12 four packs for my European buddies who really know beer and will await their feedback on this one and the others.  This one is brewed in Woburn, MA which makes it all the better.\n",
      "A very good Milk Stout. When you are in the mood for a milk Stout this is a good one to get. Vary smooth like a milk stout should be.\n",
      "A very good dark beer. A creamy aftertaste. 6.5% alcohol but you don't taste the poison. It's a good one.\n",
      "One of the best Porters. A very smooth Porter with no back bite. If you ever see it on tap grab it. A great winter beer. But I can't see why it wouldn't be good in the summer also\n",
      "A very good Vanilla Porter. I like it just as much as Leinenkugel's Snowdrift. In a tasting they were both hard to tell apart.\n",
      "Fles 35,5cl thuis. Donkere koffie, duidelijk bourbon tonen, caramel, zoetig, oily, vanille, hout, licht klef. Lange nadronk. Goed. (26-1-2020).\n",
      "Dunkles Schwarz mit Braunstich im Glas, hellbrauner Schaum. In der Nase Blockmalz, Vanille, Schokolade, Karamell, Pumpernickel. Im Mund Cognac, Zuckerrübensirup, Pumpernickel, Vanilleschaum, Zartbitterschokolade.\n",
      "Aroma: Complex smell with some notes of chocolate, a strong malty bready smell and a hint of toffee or fudge\n",
      "Appearance: Medium-dark colour with a cream coloured head, has a nice glow without being completely clear\n",
      "Taste: Amazing variety of flavours with a nice bitter English ale taste alongside sweet tastes similar to fruit and cocoa\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Quite heavy with a foamy head and mild carbonation\n",
      "Overall: Very nice English ale, best served around 10-15 degrees to bring out the subtler flavours but perfectly acceptable cold, as Marston's products go this is one of the better ones.\n",
      "one of the pioneers in beer world. i cannot imagine any other beer with this much smokey aroma and taste\n",
      "De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En almuerzo, cumple de asun hija (9 años) Con bacalao dorado de calamocha + filetes de pollo. Version de 2019. Sobresaliente aun con unos meses encima. Herbal, resinosa y acaramelada, de una manera suave pero asertiva. Deja con ganas de mas\n",
      "Tap at Besk - a NEIPA to rival the best of ‘em - crikey what stunning depth of stonefruit hop flavour - no usual soft NEIPA here, the firm bitter finish gets extra marks - this brew is flying the Geordie flag all the way to Perth, Western Australia - so, from this former Geordie to the Geordies of Wylam Brewery - good on ya!\n",
      "El primer encuentro con el sentido del olfato es agradable aún cuando logras percibir la fragancia al alcohol. Una vez en boca te conecta con sabores a café, chocolate y en mi opinión tiene un sabor a madera ahumada. El color y el cuerpo de la misma son los tradicionales en una cerveza oscura. El último sorbo se siente más amargo y más tibio en el paladar. Recomiendo disfrutarla sola sin ningún acompañamiento de comida y a temperatura de 11°C. Chills!!!\n",
      "Beer Advent calendar day 13. Brown pour. Malt aroma, strong like a malt extract. Malty flavor, but not sweet. Just the right amount of hops for a malty finish.\n",
      "very hazy pale yellow colour, moderate sized dense white head; aroma of mango, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple juice, some tangerine and biscuity notes; taste is basically the same; excellent IPA!\n",
      "330ml bottle. Black with a tan head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, honey, cherries. Taste of rich, expensive tasting bittersweet chocolate liqueur, sweet vanilla, honey, cherries (minor criticism: more like cherry flavoured sweets than actual cherries), dark malts. Full bodied, thick, and luxuriously smooth, and incredibly easy drinking considering the ABV. He's done it again, another absolutely outstanding stout.\n",

      "Acheté à la SAQ de Longueuil. Il s’agit d’une bière noire très opaque avec une belle mousse brune peu persistante. Au nez, sa sent le café et le caramel. En bouche c’est très complet et extrêmement bien équilibré. On retrouve chêne, café, mélasse, caramel et vanille. Le tout est harmonieux et la finale est juste assez amer. Le prix de la bouteille est élevé mais mes elle a bien répondu à mes attentes.\n",

      "The fragrance of Lactobacillus yeast and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy gold and pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plums flavors the body, sours the comprehension, and felt upon the mouthfeel. Lactobacillus delbrueckii adds a soft lactic touch and tarts the take. Mexican candy is noticeable with the Lactobacillus. Saison brightens the dry finish. Munich malt compliments the plum profile. Flaked oats are sensible upon the yeasty and plum mouthfeel. Himalayan sea salt adds a touch to the saison and Lactobacillus blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ume Saladitos is a glamorous sour plum gose. The plums, Lactobacillus, Mexican candy, saison, Munich malt, and Himalayan sea salt combine into a delectable craft beer. Inspired by Umeboshi soda and Saladitos, the Lactobacillus delbrueckii and sea salt blend into a soda like tinge. The Lactobacillus delbrueckii gives off a yogurt like tone to the plum and saison body. The sour plum and lactic tart are fair and easy to experience. I prized every drink and dazzled by its complexity. The artwork is by Andrea Mendoza.\n",

      "very haz golden to orange colour, large, dense and stable yellowish ecru head; aroma of intensive piney, some grapefruity and moderate tropical fruity notes, orange peel oils, as well as biscuits; taste of a piney-resiny IIPA with a touch of tropical fruits, grapefruit, maybe tangerine, orange juice and biscuity notes, as well as horseradish-like spiciness in the aftertaste; amazing IIPA!\n",

      "Bottle. Pours opaque black with a thin brown head. Aroma of bourbon, maple, oak, chocolate and vanilla. Flavor was rich, sweet and full bodied with dark chocolate, maple syrup, soft bourbon, vanilla, coffee and molasses.  Fantastic imp stout.\n",
      "Draft at the source, 2019 re-release.  Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a lasting thin brown head.  Bourbon and coconut nose with chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, still plenty of coconut flavor for a 4-yr old (the re-infusion talking), still plenty of habanero. Chocolate is sweeter here than the 2014, but not overly so and the beer overall remains well balanced.  Low carb, full body.  Lingering heat with cinnamon, cocoa and coconut.  Big, beautiful, delicious.\n",
      "Cloudy light brown color light sweet aroma. Sweet taste with a carmel malt sweet finish. Excellent beer.\n",
      "Natick extravaganza 2020 at the barn.  I just met Aaron the brewer who said this one was good and he was right.  A new favorite.  This one needs to global recognition.\n",
      "Natick extravaganza 2020 at the barn.  This one is incredible.  Till some rye into this ale please.  Awesome beer that makes me want to jump behind the tiller at gramps farm.\n",
      "Natick extravaganza 2020 at the barn.  The first time I have ever had the pleasure of being the first rater on a brew and I am honored that this is the first.  AMAZING.\n",
      "Quite simply the best lager I've had. A classic on draught or bottled. Excellent in a frosty glass in summer. Refreshing, tasty, almost perfect German lager.\n",
      "Can, courtesy of Leighton. Cheers chief. Pours like mango juice. Very fine, lasting, fully lacing, white head. If you were to imagine an OH TIPA, this is how it’d look. Nose has super ripe and soggy mango. Pineapple cake. Coconut. Sabro hops? Just all fruit juice here. Taste is predictably sweet, with a decent hit of dank and ripe fruit bitterness. Silly smooth on the palate, with barely a trace of the 10%. Fine carbonation. Lingering juicy bitterness to finish. Awesome big hitter.\n",
      "Black appearance with a small light brown head. Alluring aroma of toasted coconut, chocolate, molasses, mild oak and light coffee notes. Similar flavor, pleasant barrel notes with strong coconut and lingering complexities. Full body with a soft smooth feel and a lasting finish. Excellent.\n",

      "Dark brown pour with a fleeting white head. Amazing nose with dark fruit and caramel standouts. Fantastic. Taste follows suit with muted oak and whiskey backbeats. Man, not many people do this style and even less do it right. This is a real stunner. Bravo!!\n",
      "0,33 bottle. Világos, átlátszó, valódi aranysárga szín, kehelyben hatalmas fehér habbal. Viszonylag visszafogott illat, komlós, gyantás, picit citrusos, alkohol teljesen elbújtatva. Nagyon durván komplex, testes, de nagyon finom, és jól iható triple. Érdemes egy-egy kortyonként inni. Minden kortynál kijön valamilyen íz. Édes-pezsgő-szőlő, vagy komlós keserű, vagy édes, mézes, aszalt gyümölcsös, vagy narancshéj. Ez nem vicc, tényleg. Nagyon jó a szénsavassága is. Most már lassan kóstoltam az alap trappista triple-belga söröket, de számomra eddig ez a legjobb!\n",
      "Draught. Amazingly juicy citrus fruit throughout. Amazingly clean taste, superb balance, hoppy to the core yet without a trace of hop burn. Shows that a simple beer can be mindblowing. Could drink this everyday.\n",
      "Can at home bought from brewery website. The beer poured hazy as usual with this brewery. Yet again cloudwater are at their very best with this beer. Its juicy, hoppy, refreshing and with tropical fruits\n",
      "16-ounce can finally settles into a black color with ruby highlights and a 1\" thick super creamy tan head and lots of residual lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate. Flavor: milk chocolate, coffee with cream, figs, dates, campfire marshallows, burnt wood. Mouthfeel: medium-bodied with a very creamy finish.\n",
      "2017 vintage.\n",

      "Great American style IPA, hazy golden colour, pineapple and citrusy flavours and plenty of hops.\n",
      "Can, 0.473l. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, caramel, vanilla and coconut. Pours almost black color with medium sized frothy brown head and average sparkling appearance. Taste starts with sweet chocolate and coconut, follows by bourbon, molasses, vanilla and roasted malt, mouthfeel is warm alcoholic, while finish is mild bitter. Full body, thick creamy texture and average carbonation in palate. Bruemaster...\n",
      "Attained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $10.25, Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout brewed with liquid cocoa and cocoa nibs is crafted by Mother Earth Brew Company from Vista, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of cocoa, roasted malt, lactose, and mint are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 10.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liquid cocoa is rich, creamy, prominent in tone, and tasted when you lick your chops. Roasted malt lightly textures the mouthfeel. Cocoa nibs is tangible and compliments the roasted malt feel. Milk assists with the creamy liquid cocoa hue. Mint is strong from beginning to end and imbued with the liquid cocoa and milk complexion. Rye malt is distinguished as the finish drags on. A caramel, barleywine touch is discerned upon the mouthfeel in the finish. Oak applies a woodsy tinge to the liquid cocoa, milk, and caramel finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout is a luminous stout. The liquid cocoa, roasted malt, cocoa nibs, milk, mint, rye malt, and barleywine combine into an impressive interpretation of a mint chocolate stout. The barleywine, rye malt, and cocoa nibs provide a hair-raising finish. The liquid cocoa and milk blend delightfully together. The barleywine barrel aging is the highlight of this beer. I cherished every single drink and found an impressive beer beyond a variant of a style.\n",

      "Label im Stil eines Kupferstichs. Schwarz-Braun mit stouttypisch dichtem braunem Schaum. Geruch: unerwartet wenig Süße, voluminöse runde Röstmalzaromen. Geschmack: Auch hier weniger Süße als bei den meisten Stouts. Ein sehr rundes und leckeres Stout.\n",
      "Can at home bought from mikkeller's website. This was such a good beer. Its hazy, fruit, smooth, tropical fruits, and bloody beautiful beer\n",
      "22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2019 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with solid retention, that reduces a spotty ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, brownie/cake batter, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, nuts, biscuit, and brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, dark fruit, char, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/oaky earthiness. Amazing aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, maple syrup, vanilla, chocolate, light-moderate bourbon barrels, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, brownie/cake batter, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, nuts, biscuit, and brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, dark fruit, char, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, roast, char bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, brownie/cake batter, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, nuts, biscuit, brown bread, light molasses/dark fruit/char, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Insane complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, maple syrup, vanilla, chocolate, light-moderate bourbon barrels, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with an amazing roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Minimal warmth of 13% or lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged pastry stout. All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, maple syrup, vanilla, chocolate, light-moderate bourbon barrels, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to sip on for the huge ABV with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Perfectly balanced super rich malts, chocolate, vanilla, and maple flavor complexity; with nice barrel presence and mild earthy hops/fruity yeast. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. Not too heavy on the barrel. A pretty mind blowing offering. Legitimately one of the best Pastry stouts I've ever had.\n",
      "16-ounce can pours cloudy gold-yellow-orange with a 1/2\" fluffy beige head and residual lacing. Aroma: fragrant tropical and citrus fruits. Flavor: fresh and succulent tangerine, cantaloupe, pineapple, apple, mango, apricots, peaches and pears, along with honey and pine. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied with a creamy and slick finish. A great deal of flavor packed into a beer with this ABV. Drinks more like a DIPA. Very tasty!\n",
      "500ml shared by brother at home. Aroma: lots of wood, chocolate, lots of caramel, lots bourbon and alcohol coming through. App: dark brown almost black, minimal to no head, shy lacing. Taste and palate: full body but thin feeling, liquoreux, medium sweetness, lots of chocolate and caramel, light acidity and alcool burning finish. Overall: damn good. The nose and mouthfeel of this one is amazing. Not too sure where I could take away points on this bet tbh. Maybe appearance I guess? Excellent!\n",

      "Bottiglia 2018. Quasi totalmente nera, poca schiuma color nocciola e dalla velocissima evanescenza. Profumo ciliegie, prugna, uvetta, leggera vaniglia, tostature, legno affumicato e bourbon. Al palato sempre dark fruir, tanto cioccolato al latte ma anche fondente, caffè, vaniglia, tabacco e note alcoliche ma gentili di bourbon. Finale con leggera luppolatura. Retrogusto di cioccolatino al whisky. Sorso vellutato e pieno, carbonazione bassa. Bevuta dove il dolce, le tostature e il bourbon si bilanciano e completano in modo sopraffino. Ottima\n",
      "We reviewed this in episode 71 of the Peaceful Treason podcast.  This beer is surprisingly approaching flawless as a sour.  It's very complex, bursting at the seems with flavor, and uniquely balanced.  The sour sensations hit all parts of the tongue at different times, and the sweetness is very well infused into the flavor profile without disrupting the sour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our collective rating was 9.5/10.  Highly recommended.  Bonus points for the disturbing artwork!\n",
      "Black pour with a thin beige head. Lovely semisweet aroma of dark bittersweet chocolate and graham cracker and a kiss of vanilla. Lovely flavor that’s dark and chocolaty with a nice little sweetness and a kiss of vanilla with a lovely undertone of dark bourbon and just a whisper of barrel char. Mellow sweetness and dark malty chocolaty roastiness.\n",
      "Most people here claim this beer is bitter.  I respectfully disagree.  This beer is hoppy, but very well balanced.  I’d actually call it malt forward.   Very well done.  Daddy like.\n",
      "Bottle from 4 pack. Black and opaque. Strong malt and roast aroma.  Wow! Really good. Strong with roasted, bourbon and malt. Warming.\n",

      "Gifted for Christmas from Jenna and James Sepulveda (purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $14.99), Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a malt beverage brewed with spices crafted between Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri and Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of saison, rye, honey, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber with a half a finger of white head. When held up to light, a cloudy golden amber shows. The alcohol content is 7.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saison is fairly sweet and wholesome to the complexion. Caramel malt textures the mouthfeel and light to the body. Honey blends well with the saison and caramel. Coriander compliments the caramel and honey frame. Orange peel is tangible with the saison feel. Lemon peel is subtle to the honeyed touch. Safir hops applies a tangerine hue to the saison and orange peel combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rye fairly spices the take and the caramel comprehension. Grains of paradise softly peppers the malt body. Oats adds texture to the mouthfeel and easily picked out in the finish. Pear is drawn out in the finish followed by the honey. Perle hops express mint and evergreen notes that are vibrant to the pear finish. Clove provides an underlying tone to the minty profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a sensational malt beverage. The saison, caramel malt, honey, rye, orange peel, lemon peel, and Safir hops makes this beer a one of a kind. The caramel, honey, and rye blend beautifully together. The pear, honey, and oats work in concert well in the effervescent finish. My favorite aspect is how the spicy hops, rye, and grains of paradise interplay collectively. After being bottled in the summer of 2014 and aged for 5 years, the Perle hops give off a strong minty hue in the finish. I treasure every single drink and enamored by this brew’s complexity and depth. It is beer like this that challenges the notion how long should you age your beer.\n",

The flavor is similar, with sugar and cream. Mouthfeel is heavy and velvety, and Hailstorm Lumberjack finishes sweet, but neither cloying nor boozy. RJT\n",
      "I love the flavor of this brew we're talking cream soda on the hops with a graham cracker sweetness which overall is very smooth and easy drinking and not boring at the same time.\n",
      "Slightly hazy rich golden hue with a thick foamy white head. Complex aroma that’s citrusy and tropical with a little pine and melon. Smooth crisp flavor that’s clean and fruity and a little tropical and lightly juicy. Really balanced and hoppy with just the right amount of bitterness due the style. Really well done.\n",

Texture features firm, ciscous body and lively fizz with a fruity finish. A peach of a brewski!\n",

      "0,33 bottle. A sör csodásan néz ki. Az üveg és cimke tekintélyt parancsoló, a hab hatalmas, nagy lyukú barna, a sör színe pedig csodás sötét gesztenye-barna. Illata mazsolás, konyakos, fűszeres, kiemelkedő! Sokáig lehetne még az illat összetevőkről írni. de tényleg. Szénsavasság eltalálva, pont jó. Picit cukros-édes, de mellette kesernyés, fanyar, mégis aszalt gyümölcsös is, egyszóval komplex. Egy ugyanilyen hírű trappista dubbel után teszteltem azonnal, és ez klasszisokkal jobb! Testes, komoly, mégis jól iható kiemelkedő sör!\n",
      "Tasting at Andrey'sPitch black colour. Intense dark chocolate, with a layer of vanilla, hazelnuts, coconut; it's full bodied, very sweet, with the richest chocolate flavour, nuts, vanilla, bourbon, and a nice warmth in the finish.Wonderful.\n",
      "What a beer. Oh my God this beer is insane.. I was expecting something less from the famous and classic \"KBS\" but this for me is simple a better beer all around.\n",
      "First of all the aroma is great like usual.. You smell coffe and chocolate notes very much.. But the mouthfeel is the best i have get from any beer out there in my life. The beer embrace your mouth with such a pleasand and smooth aura and make the whole thing so good.. The taste is sweet with more chocolate notes this time because \"KBS\" has more coffe than chocolate. Here the taste is what i want from any beer out there. Also slightly alcohol taste in the finish..\n",
      "Overall one insane beer to drink and for sure one of the best in this world.. All here is Godlike!\n",
      "Bottle thanks to Ryan and Ibrew2or3, shared at Tilt during SHNup: Poured dark brown black with off white head. Aroma is super peach sticky fruit. Taste is super peach very boozy burnt malts. World class barleywine!\n",
      "Whole Foods Market. Abrams. Bottle. Dark ebony color, light thin head. Wonderful blend of bourbon-barrel aged stout. Creme brûlée , burnt sugar, vanilla hints. One of the best of the style...\n",
      "Pours obsidian with a dark khaki head. Smells of leather and dried fruit. Tastes of plumb and cocoa nibs. Some honey sweetness and not overwhelming bourbon booziness. Great luxurious imperial stout.\n",
      "This is another great sour for a beginner. It isn’t so sour it will blow your mind and your tongue, but it has great flavor as well as sourness. Interested in trying the other flavors.\n",
      "I’m not usually a sour beer fan, but this swayed me over to the other side. It’s sour, but not too strong with hints of sweet that have your brain trying to figure out if it’s sweet or sour. It has a lot of flavor, which most sours miss and no, it is not spicy.\n",
      "very hoppy aroma. the hops and bitterness continue throughout. a really solid west coast DIPA. impressed with this brewery.\n",
      "Cask at CBC, Covent Garden on 23rd June 2019. Clear amber with loose white foam. Richly hoppy aroma with spice and peel. Rich and intense citrus and tropical fruits in mouth with peach, apricot, grapefruit and lemon zest. A lasting, solid hoppy finish. Full bodied with a thick texture. Absolutely exquisite.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is a double dry hopped pale ale brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pineapple is juicy and felt upon the mouthfeel in the dry finish. Grapefruit blends with the pineapple and fairly bitters the take. Oranges are discerned as the finish prolongs. Mango fills the body and smoothens the drink. Cantaloupe is noticeable with the watery aspect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is an appetizing American pale ale. The pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and cantaloupe come together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple and grapefruit dazzles the take. The light orange note compliments the cantaloupe. The double dry hop is barely noticeable until the dry finish. I enjoyed drinking this brew and found the pineapple dry finish to persist long after you drink it.\n",

      "This beer pours a dark brown color with a three finger tan head. The aroma is sweet creamy hazelnut up front and coffee. The flavor is more of the same. Right up front there is strong coffee flavor with like a hazelnut creamer taste. There is some bitterness I am assuming from the coffee. The mouthfeel is on the creamy side. Great beer.\n",
      "The beer is that I've had from the series have been really good. The Aromas are not quite as good as the flavors but are fresh Citrus hops with some dry grain in pale malt. Flavors are like nose Plus some apricot, melon and a little Pine resin. Very good balancing carbonation and a slightly chewy body. Really good drinking beer.\n",

      "Black appearance with a brown head. Aroma of roasted malt, bourbon, dark chocolate, toasted oak, mild vanilla and hints of dark fruit. Similar flavor, rich and layered with lingering barrel complexities. Full body with a smooth feel and a warming bourbon finish. Excellent.\n",
      "Bottle from trade. Darkest brown pour with no head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla and roast. Sweet malt and chocolate flavor with vanilla and coffee before a bourbon finish.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from House Of Hops (McNeill Pointe), Raleigh, NC.  I can find no \"bottled on\" date but this was purchased in November 2019, has a black label, and has an ABV of 12.4%.  Pours black with a short khaki head.  Enticing aroma of rye whiskey, star anise, and roasted coffee.  Taste is of dark chocolate, black licorice, vanilla, coconut, and damp oak.  Warm finish.  A great surprise from Lagunitas!\n",
      "Black pour with a thin rocky light tan head that quickly disappears. Lovely nose of peanut butter and vanilla lactose and a little banana. Smooth dark sweet flavor of milk chocolate and peanut and bananas Foster. Light lingering touch of vanilla, chocolate, peanut, and marshmallow.\n",
      "Half pour at The Draft Room on 12/20/19. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a thick tan head. Aroma of malt, Log Cabin maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla and booze. Sweet malt flavor transitioning to cinnamon, maple and bourbon before a vanilla and maple finish. Really good stuff!\n",

      "Waxed bomber from Bine & Vine. Pours dark brn/blk with a large, creamy darkish tan head. Aroma of chocolate and very toasty malt followed by a big hit of sherry. Arguably full bodied. Flavor starts with musty oak, then sherry, then very toasty malt, and then some chocolate, finishing with a pleasing level of heat. Smooth sherry continues, with a pleasant taste of musty oak with each quaff. This is quite delicious. The world needs more ancient sherry barrels!\n",
      "Bottle. Dark brown color. Opaque. Tan head. Sweet chocolate aroma. Light spice. Wood and port. Sweet flavor. Syrup and maple mouthfeel. Thick. Soft sweetness. Good!\n",
      "12oz bottle from Discount in Waukesha, shared with bananabi11. Holy cow ... KBS, and they added ESPRESSO! About black pour with a tan ice cream head. Big espresso to go with the lovely barrel and great Founders malts. Still has the KBS \"slightly thin\" issue. Excellent nose. Super tasty.  Yum! 17.3\n",
      "Tap at ABC. Colour...hazy peach with a thick very head. Nose...fresh, heady, fleshy hops with peach and apricot purée. Palate... full, bright, chewy and plush with the dry hop character. This is a ball buster, but in a good way! Light tartness mid palate with Incan berries, quince and sumo orange pith. The finish is very long, lightly cloying and provides a sudden headiness of ethanol.\n",
      "It is what a German beer should taste like. A great beer to start with. German friends say it is an authentic German beer.\n",
      "Kolsvart med ljusbrunt skum. Doftar och smakar mycket bourbonfat! Även choklad och kaffe. Söt och fyllig med ganska mycket alkoholsting. Sjukt gött!\n",
      "Deep dark plummy brown with a thin sticky ring of ivory head. Lovely nose of dark Belgian malt with fruity tones of dates and raisin with light relaxing herbal undertones and a touch of vanilla. Smooth rich flavor that’s gently sweet with dark stone fruit tones and light vanilla and a touch of caramel and dates and a smooth herbal tea whisper that’s mellow and relaxing and really works on such a semisweet dark malty body. Light touch of cocoa throughout. Delightful.\n",

      "Exceptional strong Stout that keeps its flavor despite being over 8% alcohol.\n",
      "500-ml bottle from clybourn. good foamy head, huge chocolate earthy burnt nose, creamy, chocolate, burnt, soy, dark fruit.\n",
      "An excellent finish to your day with a very nice creamy head that lingers silky smooth well after consumption, and this is what distinguishes the Founders Imperial Stout from it's peers. I've found numerous Imperial Stouts with very nice flavor, but this finish is outstanding. Overall rating 98.\n",
      "Near black pour. Tan head. Aroma is maple syrup. Taste is maple and some booziness at the end. Really like.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink. \n",

      "Less than 16 week old bottle, from Bier Huis, Ossett. Hazed, medium gold. Some fine floaters. Fine ring of white head. Wasn’t having a beer for a week, supposedly, but got a flyer from work, and did this with some crumpets and Alpha Toma cheese. I don’t know sometimes, but words can’t do justice. This is a beer I haven’t had since pre RB days, and I remember it standing out back then as something unique and exciting. It’s just a warming, ridiculously smooth and tasty, bittersweet glass of gorgeousness.\n",

      "Portland, Maine, poured from a can.  Clean, pure, effervescent sensations from start to finish.  My current favorite afternoon beer.  ABV is 4.6%, about the same as Founder's All-Day IPA, which I would consider to be this beer's cousin in the ale family.  I'm not sure what qualifies this as a pilsner as opposed to a session IPL.  Whatever it is, as a bitter and hoppy lager, I think this is excellent.  It has fruity, juicy front notes and a long citrus-rind finish.\n",
      "I don't know if this is technically a pilsner, but regardless it's my favorite pilsner.  Perfectly balanced and very refreshing.  Exactly what you want from this type of beer.\n",

      "I waiting so long time to find and after drink this beer in my country and i was so exciting to try it.. But all my excitement was nothing when i finally drink this beer..\n",
      "Anyway like i said i was pretty sure for how good can be this legendary beer and when i open it the aroma bursting my nose in the first secs. So much coffe inside and so much power. The beer is really lively.. And when i get the first draught, one massive mouthfeel fill my mouth and my stomach.. This beer is a real dynamite.. It has the most coffe flavor i have get from any other beer out there and i love that. The beer is so rich and complex and give you one insane mouthfeel and go down in your stomach so smouth.. Your mouth is so alive when you drink this beer.. You can get any detail from the flavors in your mouth.. Chocolate, caramel and one massive amount of rich coffe there.. Also the carboration is moderate and in the right levels.\n",
      "Overall one of the best and rich beers i have drink in my life. And also the most coffe beer too.. Despite \"Stout - imperial\" beers are so expensive, this one deserve every penny from my wallet..\n",
      "From a 500ml bottle on 17/1/2020 (Christmas present from Desmond). Pours a really deep cloudy amber with small head which dissipates quickly. The nose features toffee, caramel, cake, spice and dried fruit. Flavour wise, it's huge and impressive. Again, there's caramel, toffee, and Christmas cake, but also butterscotch, as well as dates, prunes and raisins. There are some firm piney slightly spicy hops at the back, which finish of proceedings beautifully. The mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, the carbonation moderate. Goddamn this is a magnificent, complex, rich and sumptuous treat. Seems more like a hoppy barley wine than IIPA, but who cares when it's this good? The 10.5% doesn't necessarily surprise, yet it's extremely approachable. Just outstanding.\n",
      "Perfect black pour w/ a mocha head & good lacing. The aroma is a lovely bourbon & espresso blend. The taste is a phenomenal blend of the bourbon & espresso. The coffee pops yet the mouthfeel is so soft & enticing. Another masterpiece from the kings of stouts!\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a hazy orange color with a huge frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is Orange, pineapple, apple, grapefruit, mango, slight papaya and apricot and peach. Taste follows the aroma with a very well balance between hops and malts. Medium heavy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking and alcohol very well hidden. Awesome Beer!\n",
      "From the 500 ml. bottle with no date noticed but probably from Oct 2019.  Handsome deep mahogany brown pour with a long lingering tan head.  Enticing aroma of smoke malts, smoked meat, and floral attributes.  The body is medium to full.  It is also very smooth.  The taste is just lovely with its smoky sweetness that usurps everything else save for the light floral finale.  What an extraordinary beer. But I am a fan of this style.\n",
      "16-ounce can pours slightly hazy gold with a spritz of beige head and residual lacing. Aroma: fragrant tropical fruits. Flavor: mango, pineapple, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, jack fruit, guava, tangerine, honey, pine. Mouthfeel: full-bodied, with an oily finish.\n",
      "Growler shared in London - big thanks to Garrold. Pours deep brown with a bubbly beige head. Gorgeous, lots of freshly brewed coffee, chocolate, soft roast, brownies. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Lightly warming finish, rich chocolate, coffee, touches of ash. Impressive.\n",

      "Little cloudy blond beer, small creamy irregular off-white head, little stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: lots of super dank hops, lovely, piny, bit herbal, laurel, very intense, some onions, oh my god, this is an amazing beer! MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: super fruity, resinous, lovely, super dank, nice bitterness, some grapefruit. Aftertaste: lovely, super dank, earthy, very nice, love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite beer of the evening. this is a fine traditional west coast IPA. Plenty of hops and bite, it's just a solid beer.\n",
      "Deep reddish appearance with purple hues and a pink head. Juicy aroma of raspberries, sour funk, mild grape and light lemon zest. Similar flavor, jammy and tart with moderate acidity and a mild puckering mouthfeel. Lingering raspberry finish. Absolutely delicious overall.\n",
      "Purple appearance with a white head and pink hues. Enticing aroma of blackberries, jam, fresh vanilla and pleasant sour notes. Similar flavor, adding moderate acidity and moderate sweetness. Medium body with a balanced feel and a pleasant tart/berry finish. Excellent.\n",
      "Black pour. Aroma of peanut butter and chocolate.  Full of peanut butter and chocolate taste. Not sweet.\n",
      "750-ml caged and corked bottle pours nearly opaque auburn-brown with a tiny tan head and residual lacing. Aroma: dark dried fruits, cherries, brown sugar. Flavor: raisins, plums, dates, figs, molasses cookies, fruitcake, caramel, caramelized malt vinegar. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied with a slick finish.\n",
      "Hanss down, one of the Best IPAs.  I have tasted. I vacation in Saugatuck and recently found local KC Grocery HyVee.\n",
      "Cloudy deep golden with a thin foamy white head. Big nose of peaches and pineapple and a little marijuana dankness. Big flavor that’s pale and juicy and soft with bright fruity juicy flavors of pineapple and white peach. Juicy and citrusy and tropical with a little weed and smooth juicy pale malt. Lovely.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $5.99), Hitchhiking Ghosts is a hazy IPA crafted by Brouwerij West from San Pedro, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of pineapple and floral hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pineapple is juicy and offers a fair tart to the take. Motueka hops compliments the pineapple with a lime touch. Citra hops give off a mango hue to the pine complexion. Mosaic hops imbues a bubblegum flavor to the body. Raw oats are distinguished upon the mouthfeel in the finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hitchhiking Ghosts is an ethereal IPA. The pineapple and Motueka hops combination is the vehicle that takes us on for the ride. The bubblegum aspect is the figurative hitchhiker while setting the beer apart. The mango and bubblegum notes harmonize well with the raw oats. I loved drinking this craft brew and impressed by its creative, interpretive concept.\n",

      "Can version.  This is not a beer for pub drinking. Its not a beer for the football game. Its not a summertime cookout beer. There is nothing \"everyday\" about this beer. This is a full on, \"sip by the rustic fireplace for an extended period of time beer\". Its huge, full of bourbon character, resplendent with dark rich chocolate and toasted coconut, and packs a punch like an angry yak in mating season.  Beautiful oak, vanilla, coconut and chocolate ooze from the glass. A long chocolaty finish is helped along by a rising alcohol heat that warms all the way down. At 12.2%, its strong, but not overly hot. Rather, its rich, moderately sweet, and has tons of umami.  Decadent, over the top, but well crafted, and ultimately \"worth it\". Dont cheat yourself. Put those lips on this.\n",
      "Malty sweetness with pleasant bitterness that finishes crisp and clean. A Canadian classic, super easy drinking, and one of my favourite beers to sip any time of the year. Tried the unfiltered at the end of the tour at their brewery in Toronto, equally delicious!\n",

      "Absence of Light has a medium, beige head, a dark brown appearance, and very minimal glass lacing. The aroma is of peanut butter and dark malts. The flavor is similar, with cocoa, cream, coffee, and no bitterness. Mouthfeel is into heavy, and Absence of Light finishes medium dry. RJT\n",

      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick and persistent cocoa head. Aroma yields roast malt, quality coffee, chocolate, earthy and nutty tones, demanding a taste. Flavor provides rich coffee, chocolate, roast malt, nutty, earthy and subtle toffee notes, adding up to one delicious ale. Texture features firm, viscous body and lively fizz. You'll need a steady hand to drink this one!\n",

      "Had this last night (one of a six I purchased directly from the brewery), 2 Row's Feelin’ Hazy NE DIPA.  Unfiltered, to the point of noticeable chunks of yeast in the pour, which dissolve as the beer warms from the 38 degrees of my fridge.  Effervescent in the mouth, big hops (pine nuts, resin) on the start, but with a rounded, juicy, citrus finish.  Great balance of bitter at the start and very slightly sweet at the end. Hides its 9% very well because of its inherent drinkability.  It’s an excellent version of the NE style from a promising new Utah brewery. It may be in the Straptank Hazy league (a limited ed. from the talented Springville brewmaster), but since that beer has evolved into a legend in my mind, it’s hard for me to say. Regardless, the 2 Row NE is very, very good.\n",
      "Saint Archer Gold has a thick, white head, a clear, bubbly, straw appearance, and no glass lacing. The aroma is of sweet, musty grains, and the flavor is similar, with a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Saint Archer Gold finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT\n",
      "Medium to sweet, not sweet in my opinion.  For me this really hits the spot and has a light refreshing flavour with good, lingering appley after-taste.    (As a cava drinker, this also has perfect level of carbonation for me.)\n",
      "Una cerveza excepcional dentro de la tipología alemana Helles. Con 5,1% de alcohol resulta suave en la boca, con poco sabor a lúpulo y muy refrescante. \n",
      "A un precio muy razonable por su calidad, y pertenece a la cervecería más antigua de Alemania.\n",

      "Every once in a while I find a beer that has me speaking in foreign dialects, because it is so good. Pouring a slightly cloudy light gold color in the glass with a rather large white head on top. Mild aroma has some hint of hops with malts. Taste is a well balanced  mild hop presence with toasted malt and a hint of butterscotch cookie dough. Old school IPA for sure.\n",

      "As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.\n",

Aroma is bourbon oak woody notes, roasted malts, mocha, dark fruits, black licorice, molasses, slight brown sugar, slight leather. Taste follows the aroma with a slight hop bitterness in the sip to balance out all the sweetness perfectly. Very chewy silky heavy mouthfeel. Incredible Stout! Best bang for the buck hands down!\n",

      "Je l'ai dit l'autre jour, j'ai un faible pour les noires, pour les noires de cette mer entourée de pays scandinaves et de l'Europe de l'Est. Une petite pensée pour mon ami Sébastien qui habite en Lituanie et qui me disait l'autre jour être incapable de mettre la main sur une porter baltique. Si tu savais l'incroyable soirée que j'ai passé en compagnie de cette compagne à la peau d'ébène.\n",
      "Can at home bought from brewery website. The beer poured hazy. This is tasting amazing. It's hoppy, citrusy and juicy and light\n",
      "Pours a gorgeous jet black with nice brown head. Nose is big. Toffee, vanilla, dark cherries, vanilla, and the barest hints of coconut and leather. Taste is equally bold: dark fruit like cherries, plums, and dates, vanilla, oak, and a bare hint of coconut. Very, very smooth, light carbonation. Dangerously drinkable. This is an excellent beer and suitably different from B-Bomb, BBADs, and Rusty Nail. I look forward to coming back in a couple of years with my other bottle.\n",
      "Black inky pour with a thin foamy light tan head. Lovely aroma that’s chocolaty with lots of bourbonny brown sugar and woody Barrel char and semisweet spirit. Rich flavor that’s dark and boozy sweet with oak char and brown sugar and sweet dark cocoa and dark roast malt. Complex and tasty and full.\n",
      "Unbelievable beer.  High alcohol which is masked completely by a milk chocolate coffee toffee taste.  5 stars. wow\n",
      "Medium yellow orange hue pour. Sour raspberry aroma and flavor, though not overly sour. Dry finish.\n",
      "16 oz. Aroma of strawberry, guava, Cap'n Crunch Berries. Pours murky pinkish-red with a one finger pinkish-white head with decent retention. Taste is moderately to highly sour (8/10), moderately sweet, with fruity and wheaty flavors. Tastes a bit like Strawberry flavored Laffy Taffy with an added guava element. Nice perfectly carbonated creamy mouthfeel. Yummy!\n",

      "OHHHH SHHHHEEEEEETTT!  This is tasty!  Pours dark reddish brown with a moderate off white foam.  Aroma is sweet bourbon, sweet malt with a touch of metallic and caramel.  Taste is big bourbon sweetness, Caramel and toffee sweet malts.  Pine hops.  I wish I had more access to this.   Seems like I say this a lot with Founders stuff.\n",

      "500 ml can from a 2019 Advent calendar.  Pours a very clear gold with a nice white head.  The foam retention is good with nice lacing.  The aroma is very malty with no hop aroma which is proper for this style.  The flavor is also full malt, but balanced by a decent amount of hop bitterness.  This is a fine example of a Bavarian Helles Lagerbier.  Some are too sweet for me, but this one is not.  My only criticism of this beer is that at 5.0% ABV it is a bit strong for the style.\n",
      "Bottle, at bottle share, thanks to Ryan. Pours ruby red. Blackcurrant, rich tart blackcurrant, red grape, honey, sweet, raspberry, floral, hint of dark chocolate, fig, so blackcurrant. Oily body. Absolutely insane.\n",
      "Terrific beer !  I’m sure beer purists might be offput as its sort of like a beer crossed with an orange radler. But I think it’s awesome. I like sours occasionally but I find I really have to sip and savour them slowly as the flavour is so intense, this one is much mellower but it still has enough bite to be a little different .  Very drinkable . A bit like a an alcoholic san Pelegrínno with more of a tasty bite .\n",
      "When it comes to light beers nothing is even close to the “superior light beer”. True to it’s name it clearly is a remarkable. The amazing taste and smooth flow makes this beer quite the enjoyment. If it were not for michelob I would not be the beer concierge I am today. Michelobe makes every party go 0 to 100 real quick!! All hail michelob.\n",
      "Berry cacao and coffee on the nose. Coffee and bourbon with berry on the finish. And still a solid stout. I was prepared for this to be too sweet but it wasn't. I would be hard pressed to name another beer that had such a perfect balance when so many ingredients and flavors where involved. I've had beers I didn't like from this brewer but could always tell they were crafted with care and attention but this 1  Knox it out of the park! Well done boys.\n",
      "75CL capped, just picked this one up. super stoked. pours a golden 1 finger, slightly hazy. aroma is perfect. this is possibly the best sparkling cider eden has made. I can tel it's super dry with a lot of fresh apple aroma. yheap. delicious. insanely dry, I love the light puncheon flavor. pear an d apple. delicious.\n",
      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours deep brown with a large, frothy beige head. Loads or hard roast, ash, bitter dark chocolate, torched pine, hints of citrus rind. Medium to full bodied with massaging carbonation. Finishes with further ashy roast, bittersweet baking cocoa, pine, earth. Yet another illustration of Kernel's dominance in the realm of dark beer.\n",
      "Clear bright golden with a thin foamy white head. Wild funky golden sour aroma that’s complexly fruity and funky and features a tangy little lactic juiciness. Brisk flavor that’s golden and juicy and tart and savory that’s got some tropic fruity lacto bugginess and a crisp golden sour tangy juicy finish. Lovely.\n",
      "Slightly cloudy copper hue with a thin ivory head. Lovely nose of toffee and vanilla and a little fruity whiskey barrels. Big robust flavor that’s malty and spirited and boozy with woody Barrel tones and toffee and fruity malty notes. Amazing.\n",
      "This is one delicious beer/barleywine or whatever.  It has a nice bourbon flavor along with the oak notes of caramel and slight vanilla.  Aroma is alcohol and bourbon.  Mouth feel is perfect, not overly strong or light.  Nice malt taste without being overpowering, the coffee and chocolate is almost netural.   Coloring is very dark with almost no head and slight carbonization.  This is the perfect beer/strong ale/barleywine!!!\n",
      "Cloudy light gold with a thin foamy white head. Lovely aroma of dank floral tropical hops resins and a little tropical citrus peel. Smooth full flavor loaded with pale fluffy malt and a dank sticky resinous floral flavor that’s loaded with tropical tones and not bitter. Flavorful and dank and juicy.\n",
      "Black pour with a foamy tan head. Big vanilla boozy aroma with lots of rye whiskey and honey and boozy cocoa. Big robust flavor b that’s dark and black malty with lots of whiskey barrel and rye spice and a pinch of vanilla.\n",
      "From the 500 ml bottle.  Cocoa brown color with a short-lived tan head.  The aroma emits notes of vanilla, sweet malts, and alcohol.  Low fruity hop sensation.  Full body.  Sweet vanilla defines the taste with a warming and penetrating finish.  Boozy too.  Excellent.\n",
      "32 oz. crowler shared Adamchandler. Purchased at the Bruery Store, DC. Huge amount of chocolate supported by dry roast and light dark chocolate bitterness. The body is full and bold. Slight earthy spice to it. Impressive thing is the alcohol is not forward at all. To quote Darth Vader;   “Impressive, most impressive!”\n",
      "Crowler acquired at The Bruery DC Store. $40 a Crowler? jeez but hope it's good! Oily pitch black. no head. Pours thick. nice alcohol legs. This is a huge beer. can I seriously drink a liter of this? nose is good. zero Booze, cocoa and milk chocolate. the cocoa aroma is insane. Thick, sweet, creamy. This is a very insane cocoa-forward beer. it's 'decadent' and I don't use that word very often. decadent, baked, primo dessert like Tiaramisu and some sort of cocoa custard.\n",

      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick and persistent tan head. Aroma presents roast malt, molasses, earthy, mocha and caramel notes. Flavor gives caramel, roast malt, molasses, chocolate, earthy and subtle coffee notes. Texture delivers firm body and lively fizz. Bark bark bark for it!\n",
      "Aromat beczki, wanilii, cynamonu, kakao, czekolady, alkoholu. Barwa ciemno brązowa do czarnej, nieprzejrzysta. Smak słodki,  migdałowy, waniliowy, beczkowy, cynamonowy, kakao, alkohol, czekolada. Niemal idealny balans. Goryczka, jaka goryczka? Pełnia wysoka, wysycenie średnie i beczkowo-dodatkowa końcówka z wyraźną nutą alkoholową rozgrzewającą przełyk.\n",
      "Opaque black beer with a slight/medium brown/dark brown head. Heavy aroma; taste starts heavy sweet and ends slightly bitter and dry. Vanilla, maple, nuts, chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and coffee. 9/5/9/4\n",
      "Money Moves has a think, beige head, a very dark brown appearance, and minimal glass lacing. The aroma is of intense, salty peanut butter & chocolaty malt. The flavor is of those elements, with lots of sweetness, too. Mouthfeel is heavy, and Money Moves finishes on the sweet side. RJT\n",
      "Awesome malt backbone. Hoppy. Moderate pines and fruits. Slight dank. Mouth of creamy goodness. Well balanced. Very well done APA. Love it!\n",
      "Super maltosa. Cacao, café, caramelo, toffe. \n",
      "Destaca su final seco y amargo que le restan dulzor y evitan que sea empalagosa, lo que favorece otro trago rápido.\n",
      "Un cervezón muy bien diseñado y desarrollado.\n",
      "Podría parecer una belgian strong ale pero con poco gas y final americano, levadura limpia.\n",
      "Vraiment magnifique ! La robe est d'un rouge sang incroyable qui coule de manière presque visqueuse. En bouche, c'est vineux à souhait, complexe et tout en équilibre. Un travail énorme et un gros gros coup de coeur.\n",
      "DELICIOUS!! Sweet on the nose but a nice beer with chocolate note not too overpowering. Great dark beer.\n",
      "Deep burgundy cherry hue with a thin foamy light pink head. Complex lovely nose featuring pomegranate and sour red berries with a lovely complex oaky acidic buggy funk. Crisp flavor that’s loaded with a little caramalt and nice tart red fruits like currant and cherry and pomegranate with a lingering complex buggy acidic funk. Super flavorful and complex.\n",
      "Couleur jaune dorée voilée. Nez fruité et vanillé. En bouche, c'est fruité,  sucre  bien dosé, une belle texture, excllent.\n",
      "Hazelnut, chocolate malt, bourbon, and dry hay aroma.  Black with large brown head.   Moderately sweet hazelnut, chocolate malt, bourbon, and mildly bitter hay and alcohol flavor.   Great body and balance.    A bit boozy but one of the best variants in the past few year.\n",
      "De Landbierparadies. En vaso de hefe de Bavaria. Con papas fritas de Umbrete. Viendo Joker, y luego The Witcher 1x01. Muy buena hefe, con todo el perfil tipico del estilo muy bien implementado, sin mada que achacarle salvo que no sorprenda\n",

      "Four Peaks may be in my top 3 favorite breweries and they do not even sell in my state (Oklahoma), so I drive 2.5 hours to Dallas just to purchase it. This beer has some great IPA bitterness, it goes down with a warm finish and after a couple does quickly impact your decision making abilities.\n",
      "almost black colour,  one inch of stable dense brown head; aroma of cream fudge, dark chocolate, slight licorice, maple syrup and woody notes; taste of dark chocolate, fudge, maple syrup, some dried cherry and licorice notes; excellemt imp stout\n",
      "For an Octoberfest beer you cannot go wrong here. The flavor is good lot of malty notes that makes it a smooth finish.\n",
      "This beer is like the go to game day beer, but when you want a top shelf selection. This beer has just the slightest bite to it with all sorts of flavor and aroma.\n",
      "Someone in marketing needs a raise, because they nailed this on the head when they called it a Wonderland. This is a bright and crisp peer with a nice mild hoppy flavor. If I was limited to one beer for the rest of my life, this is making the shortlist. The only thing I hate is that I have to drive 2.5 hours from Oklahoma just to buy it--which I do.\n",
      "If happiness has a taste, this is it. You cannot drink this and not enjoy yourself. The aroma, the taste, even the after taste, are all pleasant and enjoyable. This is in my top 5 favorite all time beers. It has a very refreshing taste that makes it worth the 2.5 hour drive every time I want to go buy it (Not sold in Oklahoma).\n",
      "I am starting to wonder if Deschutes knows how to make a bad beer. Everything I have ever had from Deschutes has been amazing (7-8 different varieties) and this is no different. The citrus aroma and taste is almost a reminder of being young and enjoying a summer day with some lemonade.\n",
      "This is literally one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. I am surprised the reviews don't have this at 5 stars. I have never given this to anyone that hasn't loved it. There is a light aroma with a full body and taste. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had.\n",

Wide taste spectrum and long aftertaste with dark chocolate, some roasted malts and whiskey surrounding everything. Strong body with medium, lively carbonation. Overall, top-notch quality, reference Russian Imperial Stout. Carbonation is a bit too lively and somebody would need more distinctive touch to the taste.\n",

The aroma/flavour is fruit-filled, dank and resinous, with plenty of tropical mango giving a moreish drinkability.

      "Sampled on draught at the Round Man brewpub in Spooner, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy golden straw colored brewer with a thick white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of golden grain malt, some layering years, and floral hops. Taste is medium to medium-full bodied, creamy golden grain malt with some floral and light grassy hop flavors. Finish is smooth as silk with a short bitterness followed by a crisp finish. Reminds me of the lager from Das Bierhaus that I was greatly fond of.\n",
      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick chocolate-milkshake head. Aroma yields rich bourbon, smoky roast malt, mocha and molasses tones. Flavor provides a strong bourbon bite, followed by roast malt, smoky, molasses, coffee and chocolate notes - a good stout indeed! Texture offers thick body and peppy fizz. This one is not for the faint of heart - or palate.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Bulloq is an American stout with coffee and vanilla added brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a minimal khaki head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 7.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is light and smooth the drink. Vanilla creams and tones the chocolate complexion. Espresso bitters the take and flavors the body. Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and espresso combination. Roasted malt textures the mouthfeel and compliments the espresso. Char deepens and enriches the chocolate and roasted malt frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bulloq is a luscious American stout. The chocolate, vanilla, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and char blend together into a ravishing beer. The chocolate, espresso, and char leaves a lasting impression. The caramel and espresso dazzles the chocolate and vanilla body. The roasted malt and char applies a tantalizing touch to the mouthfeel. I loved drinking this beer and found it to go down easy for a stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",
      "I poured it from the bottle into a tulip.  It pours black with a tan head and lacing.  The aroma is great.  You get maple syrup, bourbon, wood, chocolate, and coffee.  The taste is the same.  This is dangerously smooth and delicious.  This is a great sipping beer.  Everything is done nicely.  Nothing is over the top.\n",
      "My bottle label rated it at 12.4% (2019 vintage). Willettized Coffee Stout has a medium, beige head, a very dark brown appearance, with tight bubbles, ascending up the sides of the glass, and marginal lacing. The aroma is of whiskey barrel, coffee, cream, cocoa, and very dark malts, the flavor is the same, and bitterness plays no role, here. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Willettized Coffee Stout finishes slightly on the dry side. RJT\n",
      "Purchase in a variety pack from my local Stater Brothers. Average 10 head on top of a opaque near black body. It smells sweet really really sweet. It tastes sweet this kind of like a high alcohol burning taste at the end Ditmars and otherwise perfect beer.\n",
      "Purchase in a variety pack from my local Stater Brothers. Thick brown head on top of a dark dark Amber body. It smells sweet like molasses. It's sweet with no taste of hops on pallet. There's no little dreaded aftertaste it's quite refreshing after drinking a bunch of ipas.\n",
      "Taste sweet, with a hint of caramel. I love dark beers and this is my favorite by far. Buy it and enjoy!\n",
      "Will, Jared and Nick reviewed this beer on episode 70 of the Peaceful Treason Podcast for our weekly \"Cerveza of the Week\" segment.  This is the first beer that we and our guest all gave a perfect \"10/10\" score.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel and the taste of this beer are the crown jewels.  It's one of the most pleasant stouts available on the market, if you are lucky enough to find one.  The aging process in barrels that had stored both whiskey and syrup makes for one of the most unique flavors ever achieved in a stout.\n",
      "Can from Total Wine in San Jose.  Beautiful hazy yellow color thick lasting dense white foam.  Nice light peach aromatics.  Very fruity hops.  Low bitterness.  Easy to drink.  Very good.\n",
      "The Dark Knight, not the Dark Knight Returns. These are different beers, and The Dark Knight didn't seem to exist on Ratebeer.com.\n",

      "I really love this IPA beer. I am from Belgium and I know we have the best beers but this American IPA beer is marvelous. Smooth drink, nice smell. A really joy to discover this IPA.\n",
      "Can’t like more. Similar aroma and taste for ipa. Can’t fall asleep. Now I go to bed around 2 everyday\n",
      "This is an awesome barrel aged imperial stout.  It has notes of alcohol and chocolate with elements of whiskey.  A very good effort from a local Washington Brewery.\n",
      "Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.\n",

      "An amazingly good beer. I am so happy I tried this one. Very promising. Well chosen, the 6 hops. Wow!!!\n",
      "Bottle. Pours dark Ruby brown with lacing and a finger of beige head. Aroma is outstanding and complex. Gingerbread cookies, spicy whisky, oak barrel. Sweet malts, scotch, Christmas cookies and more earthy wood barrel flavor. For 11% it is stupid smooth and easy to drink. The flavors last, it's not overbearing at all. Wow. I loved Dirty Bastard and this is even better in terms of the flavors I like. Probably the best Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy you can get.\n",

Rich flavor that’s got some cinnamon candy apple and bourbon and vanilla and graham cracker crust. Amazing.\n",
      "Cloudy light golden with a thin foamy white head. Big luscious hop aroma loaded with floral and juicy resins. Smooth pale\n",
      "Malty flavor that’s soft and loaded with lemony sherbet and leafy hop juice and a light bit of resin. Lovely and flavorful.\n",
      "Another fruited mead, another home run from Schramm's.  Slightly sweet leaning as far as the honey/tart fruit combo, but I like the balance.  Floral and thick, smooth, this crimson/purple elixr was a joy to sip.\n",

      "1-800-TROPICS is a delightful unfiltered IPA. The pineapple and Simcoe, Mosaic, and Centennial hops combine into a delicious IPA. Simcoe and Centennial hops dazzles the bitter and pineapple take. Mosaic hops gleams the body and is the star to this brew giving off the mango and lime notes. The hop bitterness is moderate and drinkable. I loved drinking this IPA and reminds me of being on a beach in Maui, Hawaii.\n",

      "Bottle thanks to Keith from Anchorage crew! Poured an amber rust with bubbles. Aroma is huge oaky fruit. Taste is sour fruit oaky woodsy grapes linger on my tongue. This is a gorgeous beer, can't believe it took me so long to try this!\n",
      "Jeremiah Red has a thick, ivory head, an opaque, red-rust-copper appearance, and heavy glass lacing. The aroma is of rich malt, tannins, spice, & brown bread crust. The flavor is similarly rich, with relatively low bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy, and Jeremiah Red finishes sweet. RJT\n",
      "Bottle, 2019 vintage. Rich milk chocolate aroma with notes of lactose sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, bourbon and some chili pepper. Pours deep brown with a thin caramel brown head that has some retention and lacing. Starts with rich, sweet milk chocolate, lactose sugar and vanilla as well as having a full body and slick, viscous mouthfeel. Finishes incredibly smooth with cinnamon, oak, bourbon and some chili pepper flavors. Don’t get a lot of the chili pepper, but outstanding all the same. Drinks like it has a higher ABV than it actually has. Wonderful!\n",
      "Lightly hazy golden with a thick foamy white head. Lovely complex nose that’s a little funky and tart with nice tropical tree fruity notes and a little fruity brett. Crisp bright flavor that’s golden and a little sour and wonderfully fruity tropical bretty tones with a tropical semidry lightly tart funky finish. Lots of pale tropic tree fruity notes.\n",
      "I don’t think I could drink a lot of these... but they do taste like a good chai latte. Yum!\n",
      "A sweet sour. Starts sweet and then leaves a sour tang on the tongue. It would make a great introductory sour or for anyone who enjoys a complex flavored sour.\n",
      "Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back. \n",

      "From a can to a glass. Pours a hazy orange color with a massive frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is citrusy Orange, pineapple, lemon zest, slight mango, guava, grapefruit, slight banana and papaya, and earthy spice hops. taste follows the aroma with the earthy spices stronger in the sip and a general tropical taste. Medium heavy mouthfeel Very well balanced and a great malt backbone! Very tasty New England style Ipa!\n",
      "Wow. Pours dark with a foamy, brown, head. This is like chocolate foam. Augustus Gloop would be happy to be transported by tube in this stuff. Black as night pour. There's coffee. There's chocolate. There's chili. There's vanilla, oh dear sweet jebus there is vanilla. And it is all good. Imperial Stouts always try and outdo each other with alcohol, but this one hides its 11-12% well and then works on flavor. $25 a bottle, but worth it to share between you and another beer lover.\n",

      "Pours a black colour. Taste is of vanilla ice cream and roasted malts. One of the nicest beers I've had.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Pours a fairly transparent amber with practically zero carbonation. Clean surface and homogeneous throughout. The version I am having has been aged in Burgundy white wine barrels for 4.5 years. Amazing fruity nose similar to to the original and the unique edition versions. This one has a significant influence from the white wine barrels, adding a superb dry, aromatic note on top of the base beer aroma. Hints of fresh leather too. Modestly sweet, but not overly so. Somewhat viscous - I prefer a bit more bulk but it’s definitely not ‘watery’ or anything. Quite drying - lots of the white wine again, freshly baked bread behind it. A hint of sourness, presumably from the yuzu fruit, but this takes a back seat after all the years of ageing. Hops have practically vanished, least any bitterness that they may have had before. Overall this one is superb.\n",
      "Lightly hazy light golden hue with a slight blush, under a thick foamy white head. Lovely citrusy aroma full of blood orange fruit and a little spontaneous buggy funk. Bright crisp flavor that’s citrusy and full of lightly tart orange peel and blood orange fruit. Gently tart complex funkiness at the end with lingering blood orange peel\n",
      "Pours lager yellow with a thin white head. Orange and nectarine with a lemon/lime soda drink flavor. Grassy with clean citrus hops. Love this one!\n",
      "Bottle. Poured a deep purple with no head. Wood / oak, currants, berries, and lick you lip stickiness.\n",
      "375 ml bottle shared by Mark - thanks again, Mark! Pours a clear but very deep maroon-violet with no head, leaving some decent legs in the glass. Notes of rich red and black currants - more red, I'm thinking - with honey, grapes, and cherries. Medium-plus bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, coating, fruity mouthfeel. Awesome stuff. Delicious.\n",
      "Tap at the brewery. Cloudy brownish color with a tan head. Oak aroma. Chocolate notes. Flavor is chocolate, coconut, and vanilla. Soft. Light wood. Gentle alcohol warmth. This is damn good.\n",
      "750 ml bottle from Side Project. Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with a small dark tan head that settles into a few bubbles around the edge. Basically no head. Big, sweet, delicious maple layered atop rich coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, earth, and tobacco. Medium-full bodied, with moderate carbonation and a rich, sweet, roasty mouthfeel. Awesome stuff. Another outstanding Vibes variant.\n",

      "750 ml bottle from Side Project. Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with a small brown head that settles into a ring and just a bit of very thin film. Notes of cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, ancho chile pepper - but pretty modest, roasted malts, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, and earth. Full-bodied, with modest carbonation and a rich, sweet, moderately spicy mouthfeel. Great heft and balance. Well executed and satisfying. So much to love here in another awesome Vibes variant.\n",
      "Can at home bought from Beergium.com. the beer poured hazy / thick. It was one hell of a beer. It was citrusy,  piney & juicy\n",
      "Split bottle from Brusin’ Ales - Pours pitch with a chocolate head. Lots of lacing. This is so well balanced and yummy. It’s subtle bourbon barrel aging, vanilla, chocolate, caramel and joy. Seriously so yummy.\n",
      "Bottle from Appalachian Vintner. Pours black with a thin khaki head. Lots of bourbon flavor on the nose and tongue. Lovely thickness on the mouth along with the vanilla and coconut on the edges. Drinks very easy.\n",
      "This beer is a legend.  Well balanced.  Nice citrus notes.  Clean, crisp, refreshing.\n",
      "Excellent hazy yellow, fruity hoppy smell hits like a wall. Says 10% ABV, drinks like its half that. Chasing ghosts indeed.\n",
      "Cracking this with two good mates on my 40th birthday as a night cap after a day of solid beer drinking. This big, bad boozy bastard is a huge beer. It’s thick and warming. It’s quite sweet, almost molasses in sickly sweetness. I understand why this is so highly sought after, it’s a great beer and a perfect way to end my 40th birthday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smells like a wine Black & Mild cigarillo. Heavy notes of vanilla, stewed berries, pipe tobacco, and faint spice. Very sweet, tangy mouthfeel with a bite. Long haunting finish. Crazy good.\n",
      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick tan head that leaves generous lacing. Aroma provides rich peanut and chocolate notes, plus roast malt, coffee and a touch of molasses. Flavor yields peanut butter, chocolate, roast malt, quality coffee, woody and bitter hops, a little molasses. Texture presents firm, creamy body and lively fizz with a roasty, peanut and chocolate finish. Now this is how a brewery otter celebrate its anniversary!\n",
      "Purchased at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Anadromous is a black sour ale brewed with Summit hops and triple fermented in French oak foeders, Pinot noir, and whiskey barrels crafted by Anchorage Brewing Company from Anchorage, Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of chocolate, Pinot noir, whiskey, and fair Brettanomyces yeast funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark purplish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black currants tarts the take and flavors to the drink. Pinot noir wine fills the complexion and is prominent on the dry, lactic finish. Whiskey adds a boozy undertone to the wine. Chocolate malt infuses with the wine and whiskey body. Toffee is light and compliments the chocolate. Figs are noticeable with the malt and boosts the malt texture. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plums are tangible with the toffee and yeasty combination. Brettanomyces yeast brings a leathery funk to the mouthfeel. Saccharomyces yeast brings out the chocolate while Lactobacillus assists with the tart punctuation. Summit hops spices the comprehension and adds onto the tart and lactic take. Oak applies a woodsy touch to the chocolate malt and Pinot noir wine feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anadromous is a voluptuous black sour ale. The chocolate malt, black currants, Summit hops, and Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts sets this sour ale apart from the sour market. The spicy Summit hops, tart black currants, and lactic yeasts dazzles the take. The Saccharomyces yeast slightly sweetens the chocolate and toffee frame. The Pinot Noir wine gleams the complexion and is the focal point of the craft beer. The boozy whiskey makes this sour ale easier to drink. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its colorful bouquet of flavors. For the consummate sour beer fan, the tart and sour comes across as a 2.7 out of 5; and 3.4 out of 5 for a newcomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",
      "Nera, impenetrabile. Forte aroma di caffè, in bocca l'amaro iniziale lascia spazio via via al resinosa della botte, per arrivare al dolce del bourbon. Vaniglia, caffè e cacao, esplodono nel sorso. Equilibratura perfetta, carbonatazione leggerissima, beva quasi semplice per gli 11.9ABV. Spettacolo puro.\n",
      "Bottle, 2015 vintage. Dark brown color with a red shine, and thick creamy head, slowly disappearing. Aroma is immediately vinous, brandy, berries. taste is a mix of sour and sweet notes, perfectly balanced, vinousfruity, lactic acid. Quite low carbonation, full body, viscous/oily texture. The 13% alcohol is really well hidden, very complex beer but with quite an easy drinkability. Delicious.\n",
      "Excellent beer the only trappist ale produced in the UK rearly enjoyed this will buy again trappist beers are some of the best as the monks know, what there doing when it comes to beer as they have been doing it since the medieval times\n",
      "une bière bien noire et bien visqueuse. Un col brun cerne le verre. Une mousse qui reprend de la vigueur aux légères secouées. Une dentelle au deuxième service. C'est du grain grillé, du houblon, du bois brûlé, des herbes sèches et des piments forts comme bouquet. C'est un liquide suave et riche qui transporte des saveurs de café, de mélasse verte, de whisky américain et ce, juste bien dosé. On a l'impression que le liquide s'est installé en bouche pour y rester et se prélasser. C'est un liquide qui est en constante évolution du point de vue des saveurs. C'est succulent!

      "A pitch black color with a tan head. The aroma contains chocolate, espresso, licorice, and a hint of citrus. The flavor is mostly in the imperial stout category with dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, and licorice. Just a hint of the citrus in the aftertaste. Oh wow this is good!

Olajos, sűrű és tüzes kortyai a bársonyosság legmagasabb fokán izzanak, magukba forrasztva minden elemet, amely valaha is kapcsolatban állt a csokoládé, konyakmeggy, s természetesen a vanília fenséges, mégsem uralkodó vérvonalával, s amely a hordóban történő érlelés legnagyszerűbb példájaként szolgálhat bármely főzet összetevője számára. Ebben az esetben sem beszélhetünk túlzottan nagy meglepetésről az ital stílusát illetően, a kivitelezés azonban oly mesteri, hogy mindennapi alkalmakon történő fogyasztása szinte szentségtörésnek hathat.\n",

      "A kávé alkalmazásához egy barley wine esetében csak abban az esetben nem közeledek idegenkedve és fenntartásokkal, ha azt egy Goose Island kvalitású főzde teszi egy Bourbon County-hoz mérhető színvonallal megáldott keretbe ágyazva. A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az \"imperial\" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival. Ebben az esetben tehát az ízek befogadhatatlanul sokszínű jellegéhez egy intenzív, mégis a kompozícióba kívánkozó karakter csatlakozik a kávé személyében, így téve megismételhetetlenül egyedivé az eleve speciális, önmagában sem mindennapi főzetet.\n",
      "Eccellente imperial, nera con pochissima schiuma marroncina. Al naso splendide note di caffè e sentori di botte. La bevuta è calda e avvolgente, con la botte di bourbon che dona una leggera nota alcolica e secca. Appena dolce con belle note di fave di cacao e chicchi di caffè. Leggeri sentori terrosi. Corpo pieno alcol ben evidente.\n",
      "Can at home bought from Beergium.com. the beer poured hazy like a good new England style should but this one comes from the west coast of USA. Its soft, fruity, smooth & creamy, lacks bitterness which is great.\n",
      "Bár még csak egy alkalommal volt szerencsém a legendához, a Bourbon County-sorozattal már akkor életre szóló barátságot kötöttem, a sörfőzés ilyen szintű magasfoka mellett egyszerűen nem lehet úgy elmenni, hogy az ember ne arra gondoljon, magát az etalont kóstolgatja éppen, amikor a Goose Island örökbecsű darabjait ízleli meg. Ennek megfelelő hangulatban telik tehát a sörözés, s bár az év utolsó napja számomra egy jó ideje különleges darabokat tartogat, az ehhez fogható karakter még így is igen ritka vendégnek számít a háztartásban. A legnemesebb tölgyes, fahordós, whiskyben ázó dohányleveles, bőrszerű, őszi faleveles aromák, amihez kékvérű test bársonyos, csillogó jegyei társulnak, a maguk ezerszínű palástját felöltve, melyet órákig csodálhatunk, betelni mégsem tudunk vele. Az aromák folyékony halmazállapotba kerülve konyakmeggy, vanília, bourbon, csipkebogyólekvár és füstös eperdzsem varázslatos keverékét adják, melyet angolszász stílusban közvetítenek, teret engedve azonban minden elem vibrálásának, így téve lehetővé végtelennek tetsző részletességű komponenseinek érvényesülését, melyek egyenként is művészi értékkel bírnak. Csodálatos barley wine, valóban nem a mindennapok itala, örömömre szolgál, hogy megfelelő időzítéssel döntöttem az elfogyasztása mellett.\n",

      "Nera, testa nocciola a grana irregolare e dalla veloce evanescenza. Profumo di malto tostato, caffè, cacao, legno e bourbon. Scaldandosi emergono sentori di frutta scura e un accenno di vaniglia. Al palato si ripresenta in toto il bouquet aromatico. Il finale è cenere, tabacco, liquirizia e con una corposa luppolatura resinosa. Retrogusto alcolico di bourbon invecchiato. Corpo pieno e bassa carbonazione. Birra molto bilanciata ed estremamente pulita.\n",

      "Bottle, 2019 Ed. Pours inky black with a small brown head that leaves good residual and lacing. Aroma is lovely, not overpowering anything, but all the high notes are hit, cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, maple, marshmallow. Flavor is quite sweet, but not up at CCB levels by any means. Not hot at all. Really well balanced. Its so easy to make a map beer that is just pound you over the head syrup bomb, but this is really well done. Medium body. If I had a beef with this beer it could use some additional mouthfeel, but otherwise, stellar.\n",

Alkohol jól elbújtatva. Elsőre édessel nyit, aztán lecsengésben nagyon összetett ízek, aszalt gyümölcsös, friss lecsengés. Világos társához hasonlóan kiemelkedő sör! Az egyik legjobb, legtartósabb utóízű belga, és nem érzem azt a kandis-cukros keserű mellékízt! Nagyon-nagyon ajánlott!!!\n",
      "I had a cask Pint of this at the Vocation tap room in Leeds. Smooth, tasty and not too strong. Spot on.\n",
      "Drinking in Boston with roasted ducks. Nice beer but a desperate night. Seahawk lost by inches to the touchdown line. Heartbreaking.\n",
      "Black pour with a thin foamy light khaki head.   Lovely nose that’s  like this apple pie cinnamon tone with a hint of peach Cobbler and ginger nutmeg spice. Big flavor that’s big and robust and dark with apple pie spice and brandy and oak and sherry with dark roasty chocolaty malt and a little booze and more apple spice. Complex and lovely as.\n",
      "DATE: December 29, 2019... OCCASION: two days from The Rise of Skywalker, we continue preparing with Return of the Jedi... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... the very picture of the genre: a golden amber body, busy as a city with its active  effervescence, building a finger's worth of thick clumps of snow white head... this sits nobly and staunchly for the duration of the drink...  lemon, grapefruit and mango build a tropical profile, with pineapple and aromatic flowers creating an inviting allure... its secondary scents include sweet bread malts and light peppery spiciness... its body is hearty, smooth and agreeable... at 7% ABV, it finds the sweet spot between drinkable and weighty, drawing heavily on the back end while biting at the teeth with a robust presence... the crunch and chewiness requisite to an IPA is also on full display here--again, if an alien asked what a good west coast IPA was, this is what you would hand it... pineapple, lemon, mango, and citrus fruits collide in a crunchy, resinous drip... strong presence of toasted malts make this a balanced affair--or as balanced as this hop-heavy ale could be... the pepper makes this a bit more nuanced as well... considering its weight and flavor, this could be an every night beer... planning for a gluten-free January, this was one I found hard to believe that I had not sipped it for posterity here.... thanks to Dave and Jen, another great one crossed off the list...\n",
      "Super expensive bottle.  Pours opaque black,  medium creamy brown head,  good lacing.  Aroma is rich,  cocoa,  bourbon,  vanilla,  toffee,  leather.  Flavor is quite sweet,  light plus bitter,  well integrated.  Full body,  silky mouthfeel. Xolid\n",
      "Black pour with a foamy tan head. Lovely nose of dark roasty black malt and charred oak and a little earthy maple and coffee. Big flavor that’s robust and semisweet with dark roast black malt, bittersweet dark chocolate, boozy oak char, and lingering earthy boozy maple. Rich and fantastic and complex.\n",

Flavour is decadent and rich, with cocoa, molasses, dates and a touch of red wine grape. Intensely rich and extremely harmonious. This is an absolute gem.\n",
      "Bottle pour at Protokoll, pours a clear pale blonde, no head. Aroma is loaded with raisins upfront, followed by intense vanilla beans, and treacly honey. Flavour is exquisite, revealing vanilla beans, maple syrup, and dark raisins upfront, giving way to the decadent honey. Unbelievably complex, with all the additions working harmoniously.\n",
      "440ml can. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma of peanut butter, biscuit wafer, chocolate. Taste is intensely biscuity, wafer, peanut butter, very sweet, rich, chocolate, caramel, hint of roast, like a cross between a KitKat, Snickers and Forrero Rocher in beer form. Full bodied, very thick, very smooth. Wasn't expecting a Yellow Belly beater but here we are. In a league of it's own. And I don't even like peanut butter. This is so good.\n",

      "Many thanks for this Oude Kriek to tderoeck. Vintage 2015. Limited Edition Bottle and with Certificate TSG sign (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed). My version was 7,2% ABV. Moj termometr do wina wskazywal 11 stopni C. Podane W koszyczku Cantillona, rozlane do 2 kieliszkow do burgundzkiego czerwonego wina i jednego kieliszka do wisniowego lambic'ka. Alez sie zapienilo niczym plyn do kapieli pod goracym strumieniem. Jak na lambica to tu piana niebywale spora i trwala, barwa czerwona z lekka metnoscia poczatkowo pod koniec degustacji bardzo metne jak smiksowane maliny w moim mikserze. Przejdzmy do aromatu, wisnie i jeszcze raz wisnie, smak wisnia rozlupane pestki, bardzo pestkowe, kwasne wyraznie owocowe, taniczne, sciagajace, lekka slodycz ale dominuje wytrawnosc, cierpkosc nieco skory i potu. Doskonalej klasy swiatowy lambick. Tak to smakuja Schaarbeeksowe wisienki. Cudo w ustach. To doskonale czerwone piwo pasowalo idealnie do takze czerwonego miesa, Wolowina duszona w sosie grzybowym i surowka z pekinskiej kapusty. Pychotka. More, more, more.

Taste is very rich and sweet, massive coconut, loads of chocolate and vanilla, coffee is on the lighter side bringing a little roast and even littler amount of bitterness to counter the sweetness, wish the coffee was a little stronger, finish is boozy, warming. Full bodied, very thick, and very smooth. An outstanding stout, and the best beer Track have ever made so far.\n",

      "this is one delicious double IPA, you don't taste the IBU's or the ABV.  It has a slight sweetness and a nice orange/amber color.  No head to speak of and the aroma is mild hops. It tastes like a 7% and about 60 IBU's.  This beer could get you in trouble quick. One of my favorites!\n",

      "Tap at Besk - this is an excellent ale - shy aroma but great tasting beer - looks like a NEIPA and tastes like one with that superb addition of coconut that actually doesn’t taste overly of coconut but adds just a hint which is all for the better (after having several overly coconut ales that are a bit unpleasant) - well balanced stone fruit/herbal hoppy flavour with enough subtle malt then of course, the subtle coconut input at the end - haway the lads..!\n",

      "Good old American blue collar beer. Perfect for after a hard day in the factory, in the fields, or on the construction site. Good taste and goes down smooth\n",
      "Cellared since 2016.  Very dark brown (basically black) with small tan head.  Dark fruit, vanilla, a touch sour, with soft booze.  The barrel gives a nice earthiness to the beer.  Very warming with great palate texture: it doesn't leave a film but coats the mouth evenly.  Fantastic beer.\n",
      "Smokey, roasted malts, caramel, charcoal. This drink pours jet black with a thin brown head. It has a smokey smell, sweet first taste with a deep roasted after taste of charred wood and caramel. Beautiful stout and at 6% packs a nice punch the body is medium with good carbonation, a perfect all rounder for me. 4 cans of this for £5 in tesco you can't go wrong. Only gripe I'd say is the smokey flavour is very unique and it may not be a session beer for some.\n",

      "\n",
      "Saison tones the body and smoothens the drink. Tangerines fairly bitters the take and flavors the dry finish. Roasted coffee adds onto the bitter take and leaves texture at the back of the throat. Lemon brings a zest and tinge to the tangerine and saison frame. Brettanomyces yeast provides a dry hay funk to the body and layers a lactic tinge to the saison and citrus take. Wheat is sensible with the citrus zing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffeemaker is a ravishing Brettanomyces pale ale. The saison, tangerine, lemon, roasted coffee, and Brettanomyces yeast deliver a color bouquet to this craft beer. The roasted coffee and citrus bitterness is beautiful. The lemon, saison, and lactic acidity dazzles the take. The tangerine finish is a cherry on top to the libation. I cherished every single drink and enamored by its depth and complexity.\n",

      "The Bruery's Banana Bread Imperial Stout starts with an impressive pour consisting of dark brown cloudy body capped with a towering tan head. Lacing is strong throughout and very resilient. Light overripe banana notes peek out behind stronger walnut and roast malt aromas. The flavors are less nutty and more bready with a good amount of chocolate and toffee taking precedence. The beer is sweet and ever so slightly tart at the end of each sip helping to keep balance. Vanilla and oak starts to rise mid glass. Overall, the bourbon is understated. There is no whiskey on the nose, and there is no burn. Banana Bread fills the palate without weighing too heavily on it, and is very creamy with a carbonation that crescendos in the middle of the swallow then tails off. This works exceedingly well to deliver a mild sweet nutty fade. Excellent.\n",
      "It pours dark brown with a tan head. Head retention is low. It has a dark caramel and bread aroma. There are low hints of chocolate in the background. There are some sherry qualities in the nose. There are also some dried cherry elements as the beer warms. It has dark caramel flavors with some bread. There are sherry like qualities with some chocolate. There are some strong alcohol elements and dried cherries. There are very low gin elements. It has a chewy body with strong alcohol warming. The warming is very pleasant, not hot. There is also a high level of bitterness. Overall, a very complex beer in both flavors and aromas, thick body, strong alcohol.\n",

      "Drank from a 16 ounce can. Poured a cloudy, yellowish honey color and had a subtle hoppy aroma. Tasted outstanding and very drinkable with a touch of pineapple. It’s supposed to be a session IPA but seems to have a touch of New England IPA in it as well. I’ll definitely get this again.\n",
      "0.66l bottle. Black body with a thin light brown head. Aroma and taste of chocolate, smoke, vanilla, nuts, nutmeg, cream and a tiny bit of floral hops. Thick body with a mouthfeel of a hot chocolate.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Black with a creamy, everlasting, heavy lacing khaki head. Roast, coffee and dark chocolate aroma. Rich roast and lightly sweet taste with a nice bitter aftertaste. Full bodied and smooth. Very well done.\n",
      "Tap at Grizzly’s. Very dark dense pour with a thin beige head. Sweet, coconut, deep, awesome.\n",
      "Le Bourbon s’allie à des notes de caramel et de toffee pour nous donner un aromatique puissant et complexe relevant également des accents de fruits noirs, de fruits séchés et de cerises au marasquin. Une mousse moka rocailleuse et pétillante recouvre un liquide brun foncé très clair aux reflets rougeâtres. La mousse descend assez rapidement. En bouche, le Bourbon s’installe dès l’entrée de bouche, se mariant ensuite à d’intenses notes de fruits noirs (pruneaux, raisins secs) avec un fond bien soutenu de toffee. L’équilibre alcool et fruité est parfait. On y retrouve également des notes de cerises ainsi que du chocolat. Le corps est pleinement rond et sa texture très veloutée. Un parfait exemple de ce que doit être une Eisbock. Un plaisir à boire.\n",

      "Four Saints unloads the hugely malty double barrel barley wine with a blast of raisin, leather, and caramel. Super chewy and sweet with lots of whiskey and vanilla in the fade. At 10.8% its heavy, but not particularly hot. The long earthy fade has enough hop bitterness to keep it on the rails, but barely. Its not a pretty beer though, pouring a murky brown with barely a whisper of head. Sipped with coffee cake, it will do the trick.\n",

      "Can from Lupe Pintos. Milky golden body with thin white head. Steady carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of mango, orange and vine tomato. Flavour of melon, Jelly Tots and a peppery hop finish. Medium body with a smooth, oily mouthfeel. Light fizz. This is amazing. It reminds me of Wylam’s best DIPAs. Alpha Delta, please bring more beer to Edinburgh.\n",
      "This is one of the better bruise in this series. Both the Aromas and flavors are very well-balanced and smooth. Aromas are cocoa, dark malt, roast and coffee. Flavors are like nose, slightly more sweet than bitter with good carbonation and no off qualities. Body is full not overly round satisfying with a slight bitter and boozy finish in a good way. Really nice beer.\n",
      "Bottle.  Pours inky black,  small dark brown head,  some lacing.  Aroma is full of mocha and vanilla,  marshmallow,  hint of blueberry.  Flavor IS really sweet,  light bitter,  desert.  Full body,  creamy mouthfeel.\n",
      "We had this beer for the first time at Granzellas on our way home from celebrating Christmas with the family in California. \n",

      "Beery Xmas #24 as 'last & best'. Great looks: clear ruby deep dark-brown pour, with beige head; very reasonable retention. Rich aroma of chocolate, moderate coffee, burnt malts, and delicate sense of bourbon. Taste is fully sweet (chocolate) and tender (coffee) bitterness, in excellent balance; aftertaste as a chocolate mousse dessert. Very full body, strong alcoholic. Clear that I ultimately like this beer.\n",
      "Not bad. Very easy drinking and smooth taste. The higher abv sneaks up on you a little bit but you could definitely crush a few of these. Overall very enjoyable. Cheers.\n",
      "Black pour with a thick foamy khaki head. Lots of rich aromas of wooden bourbon barrel and dark stone fruit and dark Belgian malts and caramel and oak. Rich flavor that’s dark and boozy with lots of caramel and stone fruit and complex fruity bourbon tones and dark oak and char. Hints of booze phenol and oak and vanilla and bourbon and raisin at the end.\n",

      "473ml can, brought back from Boston by my sister. Murky pale golden, dense white head. Aroma of intense ripe tropical fruits, peach, mango.

      "Pours pale gold. Dank, piney, tangerine aroma. Delicious piney hops and fruity mosaic hops. Chewy hops, a little boozy, full body malty brew. Everything I like in a dirty heavy dipa. Dusty resiny piney with enough mosaic fruity character. Amazing.\n",

      "\n",
      "The scent of saison, funk, and grassy hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a slightly hazy yellow that pours a two finger white head. Carbonation has a strong presence. The alcohol content is 6.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saison is bright and earthy to the complexion. Bouclier hops bitters the take, spices the yeasty comprehension, and adds a lemon hue. Clove adds tone to the yeast and slightly textures the mouthfeel. Brettanomyces yeast yields a musty grape like funk to the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biere du Nord is a resplendent saison. The saison, Bouclier hops, and clove sets this beer apart from its style. The saison and Bouclier hops compliments each other. The carbonation and clove dazzles upon the mouthfeel. The spicy Bouclier hop and clove combination is my favorite aspect of this saison. I loved drinking this beer and impressed by its simple creativity.\n",

      "Beautiful oily maple syrup beer. Sticky sweet maple syrup and roasted malts, barrel aging is hidden underneath all the maple, maybe some vanilla. Can't tell if there is coffee or not. Anyway superb beer, you can't go wrong with maple syrup.\n",
      "Keg at the Real Ale Classroom, Stoneygate, Leicester. Light yellow, perfectly hazy with no head. Big notes of tropical fruit, especially fresh pineapple, in the hop-fuelled aroma. Sweet juicy taste, dank and insane. More hops in one mouthful than should be legal in a year. Silky smooth mouthfeel with intense pineapple and melon in the aftertaste. Unlikely to be bettered.\n",
      "Vom Fass im Muted Horn Berlin 2019-12 getrunken. Dieses kräftige Stout hat eine ganz dunkle Schaukrone und ein volles Schokoladenaroma mit einen wunderbaren Backpflumenaroma. Die Fassreifung ist deutlich und bringt eine wunderbare Ausgewogenheit und Komplixität ins Glas. Traumstoff!\n",
      "Bottle at the blendery during the 3rd anniversary celebration. Pours deep purple with a small, foamy pink head. Super juicy, moderately tart, with light spicy cinnamon, fresh and fleshy and vibrant blueberries, sour cherry. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Clean finish, quenching, with tart and jammy true blueberry character. Incredible. Great depth, wonderful fruit expression, superb balance. The beer of the day for me.\n",

Taste is medium malty sweet, thick chocolatey character, cake-like & biscuity, filled with dark fruits (fig, raisin), vaguely caramelly, bitterness building with nutty & mocha notes; soft umami edges into the dry, earthy & peppery hoppy finish, more bittersweet coffee, chocolate & cake, nicely heating chili & warming Irish coffee-like alcohol. Full body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Utterly impressive!\n",

Szép. Visszafogott szénsavasság, ezért jól érezni a komplex ízeket. Összetett, inkább komlós, picit citrusos, de mellette gyógyfüves, és édeskés is. Rendkívül finom desszert sör, az alkoholt szinte nem is érezni. Minél jobban haladsz, annál több íz jön elő. Irsai-s, pezsgős érzet, pl... Tényleg kiemelkedően komplex, mégis jól iható sör.

      "Attained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $14.99, Cinnamon Babka is a Babka-style imperial milk stout with cinnamon, cacao, vanilla, and salt crafted in collaboration between Grimm Artisan Ales and Mekelburg’s Fine Foods and Craft Beer from Brooklyn, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of chocolate, cocoa, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black that pours a minimal beige head. When held up to light, no light shines through. The alcohol content is 12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is fairly rich, thick to the body, and tasted when you lick your chops. Milk creams and silkens the complexion accentuated by a vanilla tone. Cacao assists the chocolate, bitters the take, and textures the mouthfeel. Cinnamon spices the take and colors the chocolate comprehension. Biscuit malt is distinguished with the chocolate, milk, and cinnamon blend followed by a salty touch.\n",

      "Cinnamon Babka is a luscious Babka-style imperial milk stout. The chocolate, cacao, milk, vanilla, biscuit malt, cinnamon, and salt come together into an extremely smooth and delicious craft beer. The cacao and cinnamon dazzles with the spice and bitter upon the take. The chocolate, biscuit malt, and milk merge into a savory sensation. At 12%, the alcohol content warms the drink and enriches the chocolate and biscuit malt feel. I cherished every single drink and found an indelible craft beer. This brew will motivate you to have a second serving.\n",

      "Taste: sweet, milky caramel, malty, smooth, warming finish. sweet bourbon caramel malty sweet bread nose. Mahogany/ruby hue,semi clear, delicate head and lace. Full but not heavy body. Dulce De Leche notes, alcohol makes it a sipper to be enjoyed slowly.\n",
      "24-12-2019; bottle; at the Swedish house (bought at Saveur Bière, #24 of Beery Christmas 2019). \n",
      "The looks of the beer are perfect. It looks delicious. The beer has a lovely dark ruby red colour, with a nice brown tint. It is dark enough to make it look like it is black. On top of the beer there is some soft tanned foam. Foam retention is low and hardly a drape is left on top of the beer. It kinda looks like coffee, creating a nice link to the Sumatran coffee used in the brewing kettle. \n",
      "The aroma of the beer is truly divine. It is so rich and full of aroma and flavour, intense. The nose is filled with everything and all at once. Harmonious. Where to start. First, malts. They are toasted and roasted, giving aromas of coffee, chocolate, some toffee and burnt caramel. Very nice and very rich. Some dried plums and red fruit hints are there in the distance. The coffee and chocolate aromas are enhanced by the added Sumatran coffee. Or the other way around; the coffee aroma is very pure and strong and it is more prominent than the malts. It is the main character in the aroma. The hops give the beer some nice herbal and leafy notes. Not to strong, but that is not needed in this beer style. This already is delicious and harmonious, but then the oak barrels kick in. Oak wood, some vanilla, lovely sweet corn Bourbon, some peat and smoke. It is al there, creating a very smoothing layer of aromas. It is one of the best oak barrel aromas I've had. It goes so well with the roast of the coffee and the malts. Devine. \n",
      "The taste of the beer is of the same pristine quality. It is soo smooth and balanced. Sweet malts with some sweet vanilla notes from the oak, roasted bitters from the oak and malts but also nice bitter hop aromas. Then there also are some delicate sours form the cask flora. This, together with the slight savouriness form the roast and toast, results in a perfectly balanced beer. \n",
      "The palate is just as genius. It is silk as smooth with a robust strong and full body. It has a creamy lining. Carbonation is low, but the nice hight alcohol warmth gives a good tingle. The finish of the beer is rich, full and aromatic. Filled with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak wood, some of the red fruits. It is incredible. Truly a beer worthy of being nr. 24 in Beery Christmas 2019. The best beer to end Christmas eve with. Cheers and merry Christmas.\n",
      "500ml Bottle from Rehills, Newcastle. Black with a huge tan head of foam. It has a rich milk chocolate, dried fruit and red berry flavour with vanilla, roast and liquorice on the creamy, smooth finish. Excellent!\n",
      "This is dope. \n",
      "Very hoppy, fruity and flowery. Great taste overall.\n",
      "Thanks for making this.\n",
      "Bottle. Damn, this is awesome. Rich and deep, coffee and orange. Wonderful!\n",
      "PB Cup has a thin, beige head, a dark brown w/red highlights appearance, and no lacing. The aroma is of salty peanut butter, and the flavor is of that element, with chocolate malt & no bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and PB Cup finishes medium dry. RJT\n",

      "Aber dieses Bier geht viel mehr in eine Multifrucht Richtung also viel mehr Orange als Zitrone und hat mich daher sehr überrascht.\n",
      "Mousse incroyable en bouche! Relativement légère, on apprécie les arômes fruités et poivrés avec un bon final citronné. Comme dit une mousse en bouche extraordinaire, ma préférée jusqu'à présent!\n",
      "★★★★½\n",
      "Voici à quoi ressemble la satisfaction!\n",
      "C'est difficile à croire, mais c'est mon premier produit de cette microbrasserie et ce n'est pas n'importe lequel. Une puissance incontrôlable se déchaîne dès qu'on retire le bouchon. Au premier abord on a l'impression d'une douceur calme et apaisante, mais les saveurs se transforment rapidement en une intensité majestueuse. Une véritable main de fer dans un gant de velours! Wow!\n",
      "Wow... absolutely fantastic brown ale... let it warm a little to get it to temp in the   English tradition- malty- smooth- finally...!\n",
      "Can. Murky yellow color. Light white head. Small bubbles. Fresh vibrant hops aroma. Citrus and tropical notes. Flavor is soft fruit. Hoppy. Pillowy mouthfeel. Amazing. The balance is spot on.\n",
      "Bomber. Rated two days ago. Strong aroma of raspberries. Pours black with a one finger tan head with good retention. Taste is moderate to highly sour (8/10) with loads of seedy raspberry flavor. Foamy mouthfeel. Absolutely delicious. \n",

      "500 ml corked and caged bottle shared. The beer is a dark purplish red with a thin head of pink foam. Deep currant in the aroma. Mildly tart, earthy funk, a bit wine forward. Big body and medium carbonation. One of the standouts for me of the Dinos.\n",

      "500 ml bottle corked and caged. The beer is a thicker purple color with a pink head of foam. Thick berry depth with a red wine note that adds a bit of grape funk. Mildly sour. More of a showcase of the fruit and the barrel. Thicker mouthfeel and moderate carbonation.\n",

The flavor is of anise bittersweet dark chocolate espresso blackstrap molasses burnt brown sugar like creme brulee a heavy dose of bourbon and woodsy flavor along with some nuttiness before finishing with a slight alcohol burn along with dark fruits tobacco leather. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky creaminess I love the mouthfeel of this beer.

      "Pipeworks Brewing Company’s Baked And Layered 10.5% ABV. This Imperial Stout pours a jet black color with the consistency of motor oil with a mocha colored head that dissipates rather quickly some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of toasted coconut with hints of milk chocolate and vanilla almost like chocolate cake batter with a bit of marshmallow. The flavor is of chocolate cake batter with flavors of chocolate and cocoa nibs along with coconut and vanilla toffee coffee with woodsy flavor coming from the bourbon barrel all soaked in a beautiful bourbon flavor with hints of figs raisins and dates. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a syrupy consistency that coats the palate with a small amount of burn from the alcohol content. This is a fantastic bourbon barrel aged stout but I wish it was a little less sweet. 9.5/10\n",

      "Aroma: Roasted Coffee, light licorice, chestnut, dark chocolate, espresso Appearance: Dark, almost no see through, red glow, beige thick staying head, vast, full lace. Taste: Dark roasted coffee, chestnut, licorice, the perfect balance and not too heavy, nice malty soy aftertaste.\n",
      "Tall skinny bottle poured into a brandy snifter. The mead is a clear dark red. Still. The aroma has thick cherry skin and oaky notes. Juicy tannins and woody fruity notes. Thicker mouthfeel. Great mead!\n",
      "An absolutely stunning ale with a glorious bitter taste, coupled with toffee and a slight smokeyness to it. The aftertaste leaves a sharp sensation on the tongue, but it's not unpleasant. The smell and look is very reminiscent of a stout or porter. Definitely the best I've had from this brewery so far.\n",

      "Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.\n",

En bouche c’est rond, légèrement sucré, sur une base maltée bien charpentée aux saveurs de caramel et de fruits secs. La seconde bouche révèle des notes de raisins secs, d’amande amère, d’alcool et une belle amertume qui dure pour une finale longue et rafraîchissante. Une puissante bière de garde !\n",
      "This beer taste like candy!!\n",
      "Under normal circumstances (like a child’s birthday) this would be a good thing, However, it was a weird sensation and eventually a lesson in being careful for what you wish for. On the surface it was a blend of about 5 of the best hops that you would want in any beer, including my favourite the Nelson Sauvin. However its combined taste was almost like a dinner party where everyone wants to talk and no one listen. Summary with so many bold flavours aggressively punching through this beer was just too sweet.\n",
      "Metamorphism is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching. For this lovely Amarillo hopped  beer from Hampshire, that is exactly what you get. A transition. The excellent addition of oats make for a beautiful transformative taste across the entire tongue. Quite literally from the West Coast to the East in hops performance. Or was that the other way round? Who cares, I was so waisted. There is a delicacy of taste that clips the cusp of your tongue here and it makes this worth a re visit many times over. What a great APA\n",

Notes of clementine and lime and lemon citrus, gin botanicals, oak, berries, and just the right balance of funk and acidity and underlying malt sweetness. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a mouthfeel in perfect balance. This is super unique. Love it.\n",

The aroma is of bourbon roasted grains vanilla and anise with hints of burnt sugar molasses toffee and oak. The flavor is of dark chocolate bourbon vanilla and oak with hints of burnt sugar dark fruits like raisins prunes figs dates dried cherries with nutty tones along with hints of char molasses tobacco coffee anise brown sugar coffee with a slight hop bitterness on the finish offsetting the sweetness nicely. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a syrupy consistency with not much carbonation and with a slight burn from the high abv. This might be the best bourbon barrel aged stout I’ve ever had it’s so complex and delicious but it’s a sipper. 9.7/10\n",
      "Amazing. Really tastes like French toast. I love the regular backwoods but this blows it out of the water.\n",
      "De Degustasur. En copa Teku. Viendo Mandalorian 1x01. Sin compartir. Mas que una IS, es una black ipa con mayor graduacion alcoholica pero peligrosamente bien oculta, con un feel muy suave\n",
      "Can at hopaholic. Black coloury beige head with good retention. Nose is intense chocolate, cocoa powder. Taste is low bitterness, low sweetness. Intense cocoa in the taste as well. Creamy mouthfeel, low, but fitting carbonation. Really like a creamy dessert but missing the BA notes a bit.\n",
      "It poured a 3/4” head, was a light honey color and had a mild hoppy and grapefruit aroma.  Taste was very smooth with a very subtle citrus flavor which ended hoppy. A great beer.\n",
      "750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a deep, dark, basically opaque brown, near black, with a small dark tan head that settles into a thin ring. Notes of vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, fudge, caramel, brown sugar, toasted and roasted malts, toasted marshmallow, and oak. Full-bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, sweet, thick, coating mouthfeel in absolutely stunningly perfect harmony and balance. Right up there with BBT 2018 and the others I compared that one to at the time. It's awesome.\n",
      "750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a deep, dark, basically opaque brown with a dark tan - basically brown - head that settles into a thin ring. Huge amount of vanilla in this, with caramel, chocolate, fudge, oak, bourbon, brownies, raisins, and molasses. Full-bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, thick, coating mouthfeel. Just a wee bit too sweet to be one of the top few Derivations, but I'm splitting hairs. Still world class.\n",
      "Poured from a 750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a deep, dark brown, basically opaque, with a small tan head that settles into a bubbly tan ring. The port barrels impart some rich, sweet red wine notes to roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, toasted sugars, dried dark fruits, molasses, and fudge. Medium-full-bodied, with low carbonation and a rich, roasty, semi-sweet, slightly tannic mouthfeel. Pretty unique compared to the stouts alongside it. Delicious.\n",
      "Draft @ Burial - Pours chocolate brown, cola like, big cinnamon notes, chocolate, brown sugar, a little boozy, but hidden fairly well. Very easy drinking. Has that yum factor. Very nice!\n",
      "Draft at brewery. Pouts yellow and hazy with a white head. Leaves a lot of lacing in the glass. Big aromas of tropical citrus and flowers. Lots of layers of flavor on the tongue with orange, peach, and pine. Finished clean. Hides the booze well. Super crushable. An instant classic!\n",
      "0,341l bottle. Hazy dark brown/ruby colour with medium lasting off-white head. Aroma: Intense floral/honey notes with cherry, blueberry and a hint of caramel. Taste: Has a very strong honey-sweet malty start with a hiding fruity/tarty tone and a quite hoppy intense bitter mouthfeel. Rich and complex. Has warming feel but the alcohol isn't too harsh, but noticable. Full body with medium carbonation. Long lasting, very intense bitter mouthfeel with little accidity.\n",
      "Draft from brewery. Pours Coca-cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Lots going on with the nose and tongue. Big notes of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, and cinnamon combine to form an absolutely heavenly brew. Goes down real easy. This stuff is super dangerous and one of the best beers of the year.\n",
      "Magic Rock Dark Arts Hazelnut 5.0%. Blackish brown, chocolate and hazelnut aroma, full bodied l, chocolate malt, dark roasted malt, hazelnut, vanilla, spices, delayed bitter finish. Stunning stout from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n",
      "So...\n",
      "My favorite hop is Mosaic.  My favorite hoppy beer (the good batches of it anyway) is  mosaic based.  I'd say nelson and Citra are next, yet DDH Congress and Congress St (Galaxy and Columbus) have been my favorite single IPAs...til now.  I really like Sap and expected this to be as good or slightly better, but it was near perfect.  The aroma and flavor really popped and were a beautiful, smooth, soft blend of pine, mango apricot, and citrus.  Slightly sweet with a touch of bitterness.  Just fantastic.\n",

      "Draft at Forestry Camp. Pours yellow and clear with a white head. Big watermelon notes on the nose and tongue which blend nicely with the salt elements of the gose. Finished crisp and clean. Just a lovely beer.\n",

      "Bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $16.99, B’aril Blood 2018 is a wild sour ale brewed with pomegranate juice and tangerine peels aged in oak barrels brewed by Paradox Beer Company from Divide, Colorado.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragrance of pomegranates, funk, and lactic yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber that pours a fast dissipating white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow hue shows. The alcohol content is 8.2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saccharomyces yeast is sensible upon the cusp of the drink. Pediococcus yeast has an accentuated lactic tinge and butters the yeasty body. Lactobacillus yeast tarts the comprehension. Pomegranate juices the complexion and is prominent in the finish. Tangerine peels flavors the pomegranate character and easily distinguished with the water quality of the finish. Brettanomyces yeast adds a moderate funk to the body that grows as the beer warms. Lemon smoothens the drink and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic mouthfeel.\n",
      "\n",
      "B’aril Blood is a mesmerizing wild sour ale. The colorful array of Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts to the pomegranate, tangerine, and lemon complexion is extraordinary to experience. The Saccharomyces and pomegranate fairly sweetens the beer. Pediococcus yeast is the highlight while making this sour beer easier to drink. The sour and tart are pleasantly strong for a sour beer fan; 4.2 out of 5 for a newcomer. I cherished every single drink and found an immersive brew in its complexity and depth. \n",

Rich layered complex flavor that’s dark and roasty with notes of oak and Dark chocolate covered cherries and a little port wine and a lingering fruity boozy phenol. Hints of caramel and whiskey and char on the long finish.\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a mahogany dark red color with a huge tan frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is mocha and roasted malts and a ash charred malt note and tootsie roll candy. Taste follows the aroma with a slight earthy hop note and a slight nuttiness and toast. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Beer leaves awesome malt rings all down the glass. Awesome malty beer!\n",
      "Secret Santa gift from Simontomlinson. Murky yellow appearance. Aroma is tropical, citrus, orange and pineapple. Flavour is bitter, orange, citrus, pineapple and hops.\n",
      "C’est une bière très bien équilibrée. Clairement, c’est un opéra dans le verre et dans le gosier. Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.\n",

      "Le goût est riche et très équilibré, ce qui fait monter la côte de cette bière dans mon coeur. Cet équilibre se trouve dans l’entremêlement du malt, du houblon et de l’alcool. Cette richesse de gout s’équilibre également par la mousse, dense, qui rend de la douceur a l’ensemble. En arrière de cette équilibre, on retrouve les notes fruitées que l’on sentait au départ. Ce goût et surtout cet équilibre se prolongent tout au long de la dégustation.\n",
      "Donc, je dirige le verre à mes lèvres, fébrile, et mes peurs s’évanouissent, une belle entame. Celle d’une vraie bière. Une bière amère, une force équilibrée avec un arrière-goût léger, doux, très légèrement sucré. C’est ce qu’on aime, c’est ce qu’on cherche.\n",
      "La bière est bonne, très bien équilibrée, le dosage est parfait. Simple à boire, elle a le gout de la bière (meilleure analyse du monde). Enfin d’une bière qui se laisse boire facilement et qui ne se veut pas forte et riche en gout. Nous avons un malt et un houblon assez jeunes qui laissent ce côté fraîcheur (chill) qui me plaît de plus en plus dans la bière.\n",
      "En bouche, cette bière est assez douce. Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.\n",
      "\n",
      "A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.\n",
      "Dès la première gorgée, elle se savoure. Elle est très bonne d’entrée de jeu et c’est bon signe ! Le houblon est bien présent et elle est très fruitée, puis, le malt arrive en fin de bouche. Un goût complet et équilibré. En plus, elle est belle (« Vous avez vu ma femme ? Elle est belle hein ? Oui chef »), avec sa mouche bien blanche et plutôt dense pour une blonde. Au long de sa dégustation, accompagnée de la socca de René, évidemment, elle se montre légère et idéale pour accompagner la recette qui l’a inspirée !\n",
      "Ce qui frappe d’entrée de jeu avec cette jolie blonde est son amertume. Elle est très présente, ce qui lui confère beaucoup de caractère. Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.\n",
      "\n",
      "En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans. Et, ce petit goût floral vaut le détour.\n",
      "\n",
      "On doit aussi noter qu’elle fait pas mal de dépôt, c’est bon signe : on boit de la vraie bière, pas pasteurisée et compagnie !\n",
      "Vous le sentez ? Moi oui ! C’est le goût de la bière qui coule dans la gorge et la volonté qui reviennent. Revoilà cette sensation de fraîcheur, ses fines bulles qui pétillent telle une Badoit un jour de grand soif. Une résurrection. Tel le phœnix renaissant de ses cendres. La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble. On distingue la présence de blé, qui enrobe le tout. Et sur la fin, on remarque l’amertume typique des levures ajoutées à la mise en bouteille.\n",
      "Pas besoin de vous faire un dessin, je la recommande. En ce moment je suis plutôt lassé des bières belges trop lourdes et fortes; mais en même temps, la radler c’est un peu light. Là, c’est le juste milieu.\n",
      "Et ben c’est une super bière! Pour une bière de garde elle est plutôt douce, dû à son manque de houblon, mais c’est bien compensé par le goût de l’alcool.\n",
      "La première gorgée apporte également une légère odeur de mangue mais la sensation de douceur s’efface et est remplacée par l’alcool, que l’on sent bien en arrière-goût et qui perdure mais sans être agressif. On retrouve donc bien une bière de haute fermentation. Les gorgées suivantes apportent de nouvelles touches, de petits arômes qui se dévoilent au fur et à mesure. On trouve donc des goûts de caramel et de réglisse qui se cachent derrière la note principale de malt.\n",
      "La mousse bien épaisse donne une superbe entrée en matière et quand on arrive au breuvage là c’est le pompon ! D’abord la puissance des céréales puis on distingue des notes de caramel. Elle reste peu sucrée mais l’alcool reste discret\n",
      "C’est un peu complexe pour distinguer l’ensemble de ses saveurs, mais même pour des novices dans le domaine, elle se laisse apprécier. Son petit plus :  le sucre est rajouté à la mise en bouteille, ce qui permet de réactiver les levures. Là, comme ça, ça ne vous parle certainement pas mais ça veut dire que c’est une bière qui peut se conserver très longtemps et qui aura même tendance à changer de goût pour devenir encore plus puissante (et aussi avec un plus gros taux d’alcool).\n",
      "c’est une bière d’exception à boire exceptionnellement pour la savourer pleinement et toujours (re)découvrir ses nombreuses saveurs. Ses multiples facettes font qu’on en boirait bien plus que la bouteille\n",
      "A première vue, on sent ces levures. Elle se révèle assez maltée d’une part mais rafraîchissante, bien liquide de l’autre. En cette canicule ce n’est pas désagréable !\n",
      "Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.\n",
      "\n",
      "En bref, vous pourrez vous vanter de faire découvrir une bière intéressante, rafraîchissante et complexe !\n",
      "Seriously ? Only 3/5 for any reviens WTF DUDE\n",

      "Au long de la dégustation, on retrouve un goût fleuri, ample, comme un bouquet de plantes. C’est très appréciable et assez peu ordinaire. Elle sera donc parfaite accompagnée de bons plats de terroir ou des plats d’hiver, le genre de plat mi-patate mi-gras, 100% bonheur ! Elle vous comblera aussi en venant contrebalancer un fromage qui envoie, comme un vieux camembert. Seule, on la boit volontiers avec des copains en mattant des matchs où les joueurs s’échangent facilement des civilités, comme du rugby ou du hockey, quand il fait froid dehors et que vous vous réchauffez au pub.\n",
      "INCROYABLE ! Visuellement, cette bière est opaque pour une blonde, et bien que l’opacité laisse présager une bière forte, typée bière d’abbaye belge comme la Triple de Val Dieu, mais il n’en est rien et elle est même légère. Au nez, elle se révèle houblonnée.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finalement, c’est un bonne bière, rafraîchissante, mais riche en goût ! Je me répète mais c’est un tour de force.\n",
      "C’est frais, c’est bien malté. C’est puissant. On est bien sur une Bière de Garde. Mais tout est harmonieux. Avec même des notes d’agrumes et de fruits frais. Clairement surprenant pour une blonde. On pourrait la boire en terrasse, les pieds dans l’herbe avec le soleil tapant sur la tête. Par contre n’oubliez pas votre chapeau!\n",
      "Comment dire. C’est Simple. Genre vraiment simple. Mais très efficace. L’exercice est parfaitement réussi. C’est une blonde tout ce qu’il y a de plus basique. De fines bulles, un parfum de céréales et un goût de malt frais très agréable en bouche. Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer. Toutefois les finitions ne sont pas les mêmes. Ici, on est au volant de l’allemande.\n",
      "En la versant dans son verre on est surpris par la quantité de mousse qui se forme et surtout sur sa texture, puisqu’elle est dense et persiste assez bien.\n",
      "\n",
      "La première gorgée attaque par les arômes de céréales, en particulier l’avoine qui surprend. Rien d’étonnant si on a lu l’étiquette et qu’on sait ainsi qu’elle est faite à partir de trois grains, le froment, l’orge et l’avoine donc. Cette première gorgée est forte et les qualités de la bière sont difficiles à  distinguer, mais passée cette étape, elle devient bien plus douce et on peut apprécier tous les subtilités de ses arômes, assez uniques.\n",
      "Excellente bière ! Je m'en délecte chaque week-end. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texture somptueuse et je crois quelle fait l'unanimité\n",
      "ATTENTION !! Biere de GARDE !\n",
      "Il s'agit d'une bière qui peut se boire en pression... MAIS qui se boit après plusieurs mois de fermentation dans sa propre bouteille!\n",
      "\n",
      "En effet elle est fermentée dans des fonds de bouteille de champagne puis verser dans leurs bouteilles respectives. Leur goût est donc évolutif et pour avoir la VRAIE biere de garde il faut impérativement la boire 6 mois après voir plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vous comprendrez les notes lorsque vous aurez fait ça ! Elle est INCROYABLE\n",
      "This is a very good IIPA.  Nice tropical citrus fruit flavor.   Not too much bitterness and really quite smooth.  You don't taste the alcohol and at 8.7 that's nice.  Really drinkable\n",
      "Bottle at home. The beer poured like a good old school west coast should. Its piney and hoppy clean,malty perfect beer\n",
      "From the 2019 Milkshake Stout Christmas release. Pour is almost black with a nice cream head. Strong aroma of vanilla, cream cheese, and cocoa. Taste of vanilla, chocolate, coconut, and cream cheese. Smooth mouthfeel and sweet to dark chocolate finish. Delicious variation. Our favorite of the box so far (with six left to go).\n",
      "A great take on gose from The Church Brewing Co. in Wolfville, NS. This is an incredibly aromatic beer which goes down easily. Distinct notes of rhubarb and sour berries are the main stars of this beer, which provide the sourness as well as a hint of sweetness. There is also a saltiness in this beer which, surprisingly, pairs with the sour fruit notes quite harmoniously. Overall, an approachable gose that may sound a bit wild and eccentric, but that is definitely worth the try.\n",
      "500 ml bottle. Aromas of blackberry, lavender, vinegar, a sense of pie crust and cinnamon, but I don't think they were included in the recipe. Pours hazy magenta with a one finger purple-white head that falls into a ring pretty quickly. Taste is highly tart (8/10) with blackberry pie and lavender flavors. Perfect mouthfeel with near foamy carbonation. Delicious stuff.\n",
      "Obtained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $7.99, Powdered Toast Man is a French toast inspired brown ale crafted by Out of Bounds Brewing Company from Rocklin, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of maple syrup, doughy malt, and vanilla are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark reddish brown with a low vanilla head. When held up to light, light reveals a clear ruby red body. The alcohol content is 6.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maple syrup is rich, sweet, and syrupy to the mouthfeel. Doughy malt tones and fills the maple syrup body. Vanilla colors and brightens the doughy comprehension. Cinnamon fairly spices the take and tangible with the maple syrup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Powdered Toast Man is a delightful brown ale. The maple syrup, dough malt, vanilla, and cinnamon combine into a craft beer impersonation of French toast. The moment I tasted this beer, it reminded me of eating French toast as a kid. The maple syrup and doughy malt frame feels as if eating French toast melted in your mouth. This brew does not hint at all that you are drinking a beer; it tastes like breakfast in a glass. I thoroughly enjoyed this brown ale and it would be a go-to beer if I have the chance to visit the brewery on a regular basis.\n",

      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",

      "For more beer reviews, visit and like my blog “Drink For the Love of Beer.”\n",
      "Black pour with a thin foamy light tan head. Lovely aroma of a paste of graham cracker dust formed into a flour using whiskey and coconut shavings and chocolate chips, next to a cup of cold brew. Smooth flavor that’s dark and whiskeyed with some oak and coconut and vanilla and gentle chocolate. Complex and layered and amazing.\n",
      "Canette métallique. Couleur dark. Mousse abondante, brune foncée et coriace. Au nez le Bourbon est très présent avec des notes vanillées bien comme il faut. Derrière tout ça on retrouve un peu de chocolat, de caramel et de café. En bouche c'est épais à souhait. Là encore le Bourbon et la vanille dominent alors que le trio chocolat/caramel/café se partagent les restes. Pour autant elle n'est pas alcooleuse pour un sou. Bel équilibre, c'est propre, c'est gourmand, ça déboite à mort !\n",

      "De “Great Divide” la iconica American Imperial Stout \"Yeti” sin duda parámetro actual del estilo, la etiqueta presume un volumen de alcohol de 9.5% y en amargor 75 IBU's, la productora de esta etiqueta es una de las pioneras en el mundo moderno de la cerveza artesanal americana, fundada en Denver año 1994 por Brian Dunn, “Yeti” es una de sus recetas emblema llena de premios y un vivo ejemplo del perfil barroco y saturado que empezó a buscar el cervecero norteamericano como identidad propia y sello característico, abajo una breve descripción de lo que fue degustar esta Ale obscura. \n",
      "\n",
      "En vista propone una corona de espuma amplia matizada de un tono canela y compuesta de perlas pequeñas a medianas, poca retención, el color del líquido ronda la escala más alta del SRM, sin transparencias un obscuro profundo. \n",
      "\n",
      "En aroma presenta notas a chocolate, pan quemado, café amargo, carácter a jerez, vainilla, un poco de frutos como ciruela pasa, ligeramente resinosa, la potencia es considerablemente fuerte, muy marcado el carácter de la malta. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ya en paladar es espesa, tiene un cuerpo pleno, sabores a frutos secos como pasas, café amargo, chocolate del mismo carácter, un poco de dulzor símil al caramelo, un poco terrosa, jerez, también vainilla, amargor pronunciado y casi al final toque resinoso, el alcohol genera algo de calidez en garganta y esófago pero es tolerable y aceptable en el estilo, final seco, regusto de larga duración, sin duda sigue siendo un buen exponente, me encantó y es justo como a mi me gustan las Imperial Stout.\n",
      "23.5 oz can. Pours a clear blue raspberry candy color with a tiny white head that vanished instantly. No lacing. Nose of sugar and booze. Tastes like sugar and booze too. Super sticky sweet start followed by a semi-harsh boozy finish. Pure alco-pop.\n",
      "Ohhh Mickey’s.. I can’t count how many darkened days and sunny nights you’ve gotten me through. You truly are the FINEST of malt liquors.\n",
      "Best beer so far and by far! \n",
      "I tried so many other beers and I'm not saying that they all bad but the STEEL RESERVE is by far the best! I like the full aroma, great taste over all! \n",
      "The perfect beer for somebody who likes it a bit heavier and hoppier!\n",
      "Can from Whole Foods Market Blossom Hill in San Jose, CA. Aroma is chocolate liqueur, dark chocolate, bourbon.  Taste is rich dark chocolate, some espresso, bourbon darkness and vanilla. Extremely rich, balanced and beyond.\n",
      "Poured to a 1/2” head and had a deep honey-brown color. Taste was much better than anticipated and enjoyed it very much. I will definitely purchase this beer again.\n",
      "Bottle pours hazy pale yella. Grape must aroma. Sour white wine, citrus. Not getting the pils much but the white wine and basement sour is real nice.\n",
      "Fun little bottle of rum barreled bomb. Picked up a few at a recent cellar sale at Molly’s. As always with bombs, great nose and super dark. \n",
      "Nice foam head. Don’t get loads of rum vs traditional bomb but hints of sweetness and cocoa on the finish. An easy drinker for the abv \n",

      "Original bottle aged 10 years, second in the Bruery Christmas Vertical of 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very dark brown, a few light tan bubbles.  Aroma is strong cocoa powder, hint of vanilla and toasted nuts; just a perfect aroma.  Taste is magnificent--smooth dark melted chocolate, pecan pie filling, the barest hint of minerality and spice (almost minty), clean dry finish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A wonderful beer, the best of the 12 by far.  I want more.\n",
      "Flaska. Svart med ett brunt skum. Dofter av kaffe, karamell och rostad malt. Smakinslag av kaffe, mörk choklad, nötkräm, trä och en oerhörd försiktig ton av bourbon. Oljig munkänsla. Fyllig kropp. Fantastiskt bra!\n",
      "Black hue with a thin tan head. Rich spirited aroma of brandy and sweet oak and roasty dark malts and a bit of cocoa butter and deep bitter dark chocolate. Rich deep dark flavor that’s sweet and chocolaty with brandy wine tones and oak and dark cocoa. Lingering booze warmth and cocoa and brandy sweetness. \n",

      "On tap at Pinocchio’s. Dark pour, small head, some lacing. Whatever. Cocoa and coffee aroma. Whatever. Taste. That’s what it’s about. Cocoa and coffee. Some burnt roasted malts. A hint of bourbon. My only regret is ordering this last. This is terribly fantastic.\n",

      "750 mL bottle from Total Wine (North Hills-Raleigh, NC).  2013 bottle as \"Sang Rouge\".  8.4% ABV.  Light brown brown pour with a quick but frothy light tan head.  Aroma of dark fruit, apple cider vinegar, and damp oak.  Taste is bold and tart with notes of cherry and cranberry upfront and more subtle notes of Zinfandel and oak underneath.  For a beer that really punches you in the mouth with just how sour it is there is a surprising amount of depth that takes this beer from very good to great.  An outstanding sour from Cascade, as I would expect.\n",
      "250ml Can! from Rare Drop, Low Fell, Gateshead. Black with a huge dark tan head of foam. It has a sweet, spicy dried fruit, oak and sherry-wine-like flavour with coconut, herbs and floral chocolate and vanilla on the smooth, creamy, warming, spicy finish. Excellent!\n",
      "Wow, I like it. A full pistachio flavor. A brown ale with a lot of winter surpise. A great winter beer.\n",
      "A full flavor amber. Nothing bad about it. Has a lot of flavor for an amber. A winter Amber is a good discription.\n",
      "Taps opaque coffee with a thick tan head that leaves heavy lacing. Aroma presents roast malt, charred hops, molasses, earthy and citrus hints. Flavor delivers smoky roast malt, charred piney hops, tangy citrus, molasses and earthy tones - now this is a black IPA! Texture provides firm, smooth body and lively fizz. Dare to drink a glass.\n",

      "En copa, cerveza anaranjada de elevada turbidez, con una fina capa de espuma blanca. Aroma intenso a lima y limón, junto con sirope, manzana ácida, tequila, madera de barrica y un fondo alcoholico. En boca, textura acuosa y ligera, de carbonatación media, amargor muy suave, y acidez cítrica intensa. Sabor fresco a lima y limón, con mayor presencia de piel de estos cítricos, sirope, tequila, manzana verde, y alcohol. Una Imperial Gose simplemente espectacular. Más que una cerveza, parece un margarita. Aroma y sabor muy frescos, fácil de beber, y muy adictiva. Obra maestra de Founders.\n",
      "Wersja 2017 i w tym miejscu ogromne podziękowania dla pana Olka, który owym piwem poczęstował. O mamo, co tutaj się dzieje. Nalewa się gęste, nieprzejrzyście czarne, oleiste, bez piany. W aromacie beczka w najlepszym możliwym wydaniu - niesamowicie intensywna wanilia, praliny czekoladowe, czekolada belgijska, adwokat, można opisywać w nieskończoność. Niesłychanie słodkie, gęste, smakuje jak rozpuszczona czekolada z laskami wanilii i shotem bourbonu. Jeden z najlepszych profili beczki z jakimi się spotkałem. Ewidentnie czuć, że czas zrobił dla tego piwa same dobre rzeczy - alkohol tylko na finiszu lekko grzeje w przełyk. Co tu więcej mówić, doskonałe.\n",
      "Pite na przeglądzie IPEk: Wersja chyba trochę inna niż tutaj na RB, z ciemną etykietą i 8.5% alkoholu. Obok Monkish, zdecydowanie jedno z najlepszych, OH robi to genialnie. Bardzo jasne, słoneczne, równomiernie zmętnione, prezentuje się pięknie. Z jednej strony to piwo, które prezentuje nuty klasyczne dla stylu, a z drugiej strony robi to w najlepszym możliwym wydaniu. Niesamowicie intensywne, owoce tropikalne - marakuja, papaja, mango. Niesamowicie gładkie, aksamitne, miękkie, odczucie w ustach soczkowe, świetne. Półsłodkie, z zaznaczoną, krótką goryczką (nie jest to nowofalowy, słodki ulep). Jeżeli chodzi o takie \"zwykłe\" IPA, jedno z najlepszych.\n",
      "Pite na przeglądzie IPEk: No i mamy zwycięzce prawdopodobnie, jedna z najlepszych IPA w życiu, które potwierdza, że Monkish dorasta do hype, jaki mu towarzyszy. Bardzo gęste, słoneczne, pomarańczowe, błotniste. W aromacie przede wszystkim wanilia, niemało cebulki, eksplozja chmielowa ze strasznie słodkimi tropikami na czele. Strasznie słodkie, mięsiste, ciężkie, chyba laktozy za bardzo nie żałowali. Gładkie, aksamitne, alkohol absurdalne dobrze ukryty, pijalność nie z tej ziemii.\n",
      "pite jakiś czas temu. uzupełnienie profilu. Ocena przepisana z utpd. Miłego dnia.\n",
      "Delicious scent and taste of bourbon, oak barrels, chocolate, vanilla and some coffee. Delicious bitterness that fills your mouth for eternity. Perfection in a bottle. Follow me @ Kung av öl @ Facebook for more pictures and ratings.\n",
      "Got this bottle from a great guy and there is no way to be disappointed with this beer. Soon as the bottle is popped the aroma of maple pours out. Pours black with tan head. Taste of maple and coffee with the bourbon seeping through. Absolutely delicious!\n",
      "Black pour with tan head. Aroma is coffee heavy. Taste has malt, chocolate, vanilla burnt wood and of course, coffee. I really like this.\n",
      "So there are a lot of breakfast styled stouts out there, but none has an aroma with quite the impact of this one. Super rich high quality maple syrup character just oozes from this beer. That floats atop a deep dark grind coffee that truly smells like a fresh brewed pot in a gourmet coffee shop. The flavors really pop as well, and are delivered in a thick bodied chewy beer with a long maple syrup fade. Stunningly good.\n",
      "Black pour tan head. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and booze. Sticky and milky feel.\n",
      "440ml can. Opaque orange juice colour, small white head. Aroma of mango and guava. Taste of mango and guava, sweet, very juicy, good amount of salt this time, nice tart sourness in the finish. Medium body, smooth, thick for the style/ABV. One of the best, if not the best, of the series so far. Phenomenal fruited Gose!\n",
      "22-ounce bottle pours nearly opaque auburn-brown with a trace of tan head and lacing. Aroma: cherries, dark dried fruits. Flavor: brown sugar, coconut, vanilla, figs, dates, chocolate, black pepper, wooden char, raisin brown bread, caramel (as it warms, flavors appear and stand out). Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied with a slick and creamy finish.\n",
      "Bottle pour at the blendery during the 3rd anniversary celebration. I believe this was the very first bottling. Pours clear yellow with a tight, creamy white head. Absolutely gorgeous. Delicate. Soft funk, lemon, cleansing acidity. Light bodied with lively, massaging carbonation. Hit all the right notes. Concise, clean, beautiful. \n",

      "The Aromas are fairly mild and balanced with dark malt, cocoa and hints of bourbon and Oak. Flavors are similar to nose mildly sweet with bourbon coming out a little bit more but not overdone. Body is full, chewy with great carbonation and slightly boozy finish but in a good way. Very nice beer.\n",
      "16-oz can from tavour. good fizzy head, beautiful clear reddish cola color, sweet barley wine nose, fruity earthy, sweet malty barley wine, boozy, hops, bitter finish.\n",
      "Cask at the blendery during the 3rd anniversary celebration. Pours deep red with a small, frothy pink head. Gorgeous deep berry character, with moderate acidity, fresh juicy blueberry, red wine, soft cinnamon and vanilla. Light to medium bodied with delicate carbonation. Quenching finish, lightly jammy blueberry and cherry, further subtle vanilla, clean acidity. Superb. \n",
      "Goldene Farbe mit leichter Trübung. Viele kleine Kohlensäureperlen. Geruch nach milden Zitrus und milden Hopfen. Mittelgroße cremige Schaumkrone. Im Antrunk recht erfrischen mit angenehmer Malznote. Kohlensäureanteil ist ausgewogen. Samter Hopfen bzw. Zitrus, Frucht Körper. Ein Pils mit einem super Verhältnis. Mein Lieblings-Pils.\n",
      "Dec 2019 355ml medium dark stubby type bottle from Beer Hawk part of their 30 beers for £30 deal. Wow! This was only a £!? Not only is it over 14%, but it's barrel aged, and was part of a 2017 series that is no longer available. And it's fucking awesome! I love malt, and this is a malt monster! I could drink this for ever! Gosh, it's worth dipping into the Beer Hawk £30 deal again just to see if this turns up again! It's fucking awesome. They call it a malt liquor, which I understand is the American name for a strong lager, but this presents as an ale. Added to which it has been barrel aged which gives it a richness and depth with vanilla notes from the wood. Oh man. This is truly wonderful!\n",
      "Mercy... good stout- roasty, dark chocolate, licorice- smooth- doesn’t taste like 8%- could be dangerous since it goes down easy... would be ridiculous  on nitro!\n",
      "Arôme fruité de fou.  Au goût d'ananas, de mangue. de coconut & vanille.  Une bel équilibre entre les saveurs et l'alcool.  Mon coup de cœur de l'année:  OutfreeeekingBON.  ;)\n",
      "Pours a nearly perfectly non-translucent dark brown/black with a good frothy cappuccino head. Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, mild smoke, dark bitter chocolate, mildly sweet caramel, maybe some graham cracker. Taste is much smoother than the nose, tons of vanilla at the forefront and finish sandwiching bourbon that isn't liquor hot, mild spice and bitter from the chocolate, smooth milky caramel. This is a great bourbon stout, the best example of the bourbon not overpowering anything else going on in the beer, and the mouthfeel is the smoothest I've had that avoids getting too sweet.\n",
      "Acquired at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $7.99, Colombian Necktie is a gose ale soured on mangoes with lulo, soursop, and Colombian lime zest brewed by Nightmare Brewing Company from Farmingdale, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air reveals soursop, lulo, and lime upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 7.2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mangoes sweetens and fills the body, and gives the beer some weight. Lulo pines the complexion. A lactic tart softly sparkles the mouthfeel. Soursop provides a creaminess to the drink, sours the take, and adds a strawberry flavor to the comprehension. Lime brightens the mango and soursop composition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Colombian Necktie is a dazzling gose. The mango, lulo, soursop, and lime blend together into a delectable craft beer. The sweet mango and creamy soursop combination is the highlight of this brew. The lulo and lime compliments the mango and strawberry aspect of the soursop. The lime and lactic notes lightly accents the mango and soursop body. I loved drinking this beer and found it to be incredibly delicious.\n",

      "500 ml. 2019 bottle. Jet with an enduring film of creamy foam. Rich aroma of molasses, cinnamon, espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla and toasted bread. Tastes of fig, cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, cocoa and dark bread. Smooth, near-medium carbonation in this heavy bodied brew. Definite pastry-style Stout, but dangerously drinkable with a dry, roasty finish.\n",
      "16-oz can from tavour. little head, earthy roasty malty (cold) nose, super creamy, burnt bitter, sweet dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, licorice, salt, hoppy finish, melded great. bet it would've gone great with a steak.\n",

      "I mean.. c'mon. The talent it takes to make a beer like this. The cherry presence in this is crazy...really captures the essence of a fresh picked cherry. Then there's the wave upon wave of chocolate fudge, espresso, vanilla, cocoa powder, it all works so well together. Amazing.\n",
      "December 9, 2019 - picked up a bottle while in NYC.  Black pour with deep tan head.  Aroma was nice espresso, chocolate, wood and mild bourbon.  Taste was nicely balanced with the espresso, chocolate, wood and bourbon; not too sweet, not too bitter, not too hot.  Very easy drinking, shouldn't go down this smooth at 12%.  Well done, Founders.\n",
      "Bottle sample at The Draft Room for Berry White Day on 12/7/19. Dark purple pour with sticky legs. Aroma of blueberry, honey and vanilla. Blueberry flavor with honey and vanilla accents before an oaky finish. Seems to be the sweetest of the bunch, although there's not much difference there between the other 3.\n",
      "Bottle sample at The Draft Room for Berry White Day on 12/7/19. Dark purple pour with sticky legs. Aroma of raspberry, honey and slight vanilla. Honey and raspberry flavor giving way to vanilla before a very sweet, yet tart raspberry finish. Milder oaky notes than the other 3 BWs, which made this one my fave of the 4.\n",
      "Growler, picked up at the brewery. Also on tap at the brewery. Pours a viscous, deep mahogany brown. Fine tan head is leggy, viscous, and semi lacing. Nose has fresh ground, fruity coffee bean. Rich chocolate. Chocolate milkshake. Dried berry. Earthy malt. I mean it just smells like a silly good, melted down, high quality chocolate bar with a good espresso on the side. Taste is chocolatey, and fudgy sweet, with light, slightly vinous, earthy coffee bitterness.  Silky mouthfeel. Fine carbonation. Drinks stupid easy. Chocolate and milky coffee bitterness to finish. Unbelievable impy stout, with not a barrel for miles.\n",
      "Clear gold, white head which produces beautiful lasting lacing. Aroma big pine and citrus. Taste grapefruit, mango but beautifully balanced. The epitome of every hoppy west coast IPA I’ve ever tasted, one day I’ll get to drink the younger brother!\n",
      "This beverage can make you feel as happy as waking up on Christmas Day. The sound of childrens laughter washes over you as you crack open that beautiful can of joy. It is the taste of a good session and the pride of a nation. Galahad truly lives up to its namesake at the round table.\n",
      "Sjov og anderledes oplevelse. Smagte ala portvin/ sherry sød, fad, med en masse frugt, rosiner osv.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 6.5%. Small, swiftly-dissipating head. Opaque orange colour. Aroma of sweet malt and smooth rich yellow fruit flesh. Low+ carbonation. Mango and papaya hop flavour hits you straight away, ending on an astringent pine note. Some lovely nuance and developing complexity on these flavours, even into the aftertaste. Thick but silky-smooth mouthfeel, roughness coming from the bitterness not the texture. A very nice sweet biscuit malt, hints of chocolate-chip cookie, but rarely gets a chance to shine through all the hops. Its contributions are splendid, however. Smashing DDH IPA, despite being over a month past the BBE. I've heard Simcoe called the best of hops, and if this beer is anything to go by, it may well be. Cloudwater at their best here.\n",

      "Cette nouvelle recette est parfaitement équilibrée. Savoureuse en bouche, elle apporte un très léger parfum d'épices, de caramel (mais sans être sucrée), et se boit avec un vrai plaisir. Elle n'est vraiment pas trop forte et, mieux encore, on retrouve ce petit goût métallique (mais agréable) en bouche, caractéristique de la Choue.\n",

      "Une bière de garde comme on en fait plus ! Dans un style moyen ageuse, cette bière vous transporte sur un doux hummer rouge volant parmi les anges.\n",
      "Purchased a six pack of cans from a Wal-Mart. Thick white head on top of a clear golden body. Well not so clear, but not hazy either. The beer smells overtly of vanilla, and nothing much more. It taste of vanilla, mostly like yellow cake. I have to admit this is probably the best beer I've had this year that I'm trying for the first time\n",
      "J’aime boire cette magnifique bière entre kheys pendant des irl, ça m’apaise, j’aime ça\n",
      "375 ml corked. Aroma of berries, honey, peppery, hint of smoke, leather. Pours still deep purple, like a red wine. Taste is sweet from the honey and tart from the berries, in nearly equal measure. And savory. And delicious. Has a light tannic dryness and a faint prickle of carbonation. Maybe the best mead I've had.\n",

      "Bought at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $10.99, 2014 Grainstorm is a black rye IPA crafted by Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of rye, cocoa, pine, and citrus are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, brown shows at the surface. The alcohol content is 7.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roasted malt enriches the complexion and brings out the grains that follow. Barley is prominent and compliments the roasted malt. Rye is flush to the malt body and spices the comprehension. Cocoa deepens and broadens the barley and roasted malt profile. Mocha coffee accents the body and bitters the take. Caramel smoothens and underlines the drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Piney hops brightens and emphasizes the rye tone. Wheat is sensible as the pine imbues the mouthfeel. Grapefruit is distinguished upon the barley character. Tangerine is noticed as the bitter finish prolongs. An orange zest provides a tinge to the cusp of the drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grainstorm is an extraordinary black rye IPA. The roasted malt, barley, rye, cocoa, mocha, and caramel blends amazingly in the body and livened by the grapefruit, tangerine, and orange zest. The barley, rye, and pine ravishes the take. Cocoa, mocha, roasted malt, and caramel harmonize well together and add depth to the beer. After contacting the brewery to establish when the beer I bought is bottled, the bottle date is February 2014. After being aged for five years, the hop experience is gentle and easy to drink; but still notable with the coffee bitterness. I treasured each drink and mesmerized by its complexity and depth. I have two more bottles that have been aged longer than this that is making me curious how it is going to come across.\n",

      "From a bottle at Dec 7 RB gathering in McLean VA courtesy of ClarkL.  Pours a clear dark cola with a tan head.  Aromas of coffee and pecans.  The flavor is very complex but dominated by bitter roast coffee.  An amazing beer!\n",
      "Very Good Beer if it's not the best. Smooth & Tender @ the beginning of 24 Fl. oz. Slowly tastes getting boozy, sweeter & strong alcohol @ the end. I'm sure I would enjoy it for a long time.\n",
      "30Nov2019 Intense dark chocolate, cacao, sweet oak, bourbon, cinnamon, toasted nuts. Hazy, very dark brown, medium, creamy, beige head. Medium sweet. More roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, oak, bourbon, soft carbonation, full bodied. Outstanding. Can from Northern Monk Refectory.\n",
      "Bomb! has a thin, tan head, a very dark brown appearance, and minimal glass lacing. The aroma is of hot chili peppers, dark malt and coffee. The flavor does not really evidence pepper, however. I detected dark malt, sugar, coffee, & cocoa. No vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and Bomb! finishes just on the sweet side. RJT\n",
      "Can at home. This beer is banging, it has coffee, chocolate, pine, grassy. A damn good beer.\n",
      "Can at home. The beer poured hazy. This is soft and velvety with a tropical fruit juice taste. Possibly their best beer in ages.\n",
      "can at home. this beer is very good. it has a creaminess with a coffee taste thats not overpowering, then once that has gone you get some bitterness that lingers in your month\n",
      "22 oz. bottle, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma brings out heavy bourbon, tempted but the chocolate, vanilla and a gentle maple syrup character. Flavour is unbelievably decadent, with lots of chocolate, a little vanilla, maple syrup, and bourbon. Decadent and complex. Phenomenal.\n",
      "Inky black pour with a thin tan head. Lovely aroma that’s dark and roasty with semisweet cocoa and a big earthy nutty hazelnut tone. Smooth flavor that’s big and dark and gently sweet with loads of earthy roasted hazelnut and a little roast malt. Lingering bittersweet cocoa and earthy nutty tones and a bit of imperial heat.\n",
      "I got this 12 oz bottle of Yeti BA Imperial Stout long enough ago that I cannot recall where or exactly when it was acquired.  Nonetheless it says says a bottling date of 3/22/17 on the label.  I have my ABGB snifter available for this one, the pour is a dark mahogany brown with an initial decent head of fine, char-brown bubbles.  The nose is vigorous, heavily chocolate and alcohol. And, ultimately, I get to taste this brew.  Goodness gracious, mighty good. Comparable to the best from Oskar Blues or Goose Island.  A dark but sweet chocolate, caramel, whole grain bread, cane syrup, toasted pecans, bourbon and strawberry interestingly.  I think this may be the best Great Divide imperial stout I have had.  And I have had several and they are generally very good.  So there you are.\n",
      "Notevole imperial. Quasi nera senza schiuma. Aroma di malto tostato e botte. La bevuta è calda, intensa, con l'invecchiamento in bourbon ben evidente. La tostatura è importante, cioccolato e caffè. Vaniglia leggera. Corpo pieno.\n",
      "Smells like caramel, chocolate, noughat. Dark brown pour. Peanut, chocolate, noughat, caramel, salt, reminds me of a fast break bar with coffee.\n",
      "De Labirratorium. En copa hefe de Bavaria. Viendo El Hombre en el Castillo 2x09-10. A la altura, si no por encima, de los mejores exponentes del genero (schneider, weihenstephaner) Invita a bebersela de un solo trago\n",
      "12oz can this year. Pours with a murky slightly milky dull gold copper body that supports a thin near white head of foam. The aroma pulses with juicy tangelo and tangerine and grapefruit. The taste delivers juicy semi soft mango and tangelo quickly moving into tangy tangerine and grapefruit. Nice. This has a terrific balance of juicy, tangy and bitter citrus to somewhat tropical fruitiness and dangerously drinkable.\n",
      "750 2019 batch 2. Rich melted chocolate. Mild bourbon. Mildly sweet. Thick body. Well balanced but it’s all there and not overly sweet.\n",

      "Very slightly hazy rich golden with a thin foamy white head. Lovely aroma that’s gently sour with notes of sea salt and margarita and black peppercorns and a hint of lime. Crisp bright flavor that’s pale and limey with a little salt and herbal tones And margarita flavors and a touch of mango. Lovely as, with a lingering liner acidity.\n",
      "Hazy orange IPA, full of hop, balanced by velvet smooth fruit with the perfect hint of pine to neutralize and balance the subtle sweetness of the fruit\n",

      "Bright yellow colour, good sized white head, very fresh with citrus filling, wonderful hops combination, good carbonation with long dry bitter finish.\n",
      "Perhaps my favorite pale ale / IPA out there. Exceptionally well balanced. The best way I can describe this is Heady Topper that is only 6.5% ABV and perhaps a little better balanced.\n",
      "Pours a solid black \"stout\" color into a glass, and eventually leaves a moderate lacing. There is only a feint smell of chocolate and coffee, but no shortage of taste. Initially a sweeter milk flavor with a bitter malty coffee and chocolate finish. More bitter than one would normally expect from a milk stout, but still very good nonetheless. Overall a very solid stout and very flavorful for a mere 4.9% ABV. Pairs well with cheese and crackers.\n",
      "Superb strong ale on draught at The Golden Bowler, Stubbington, Near Fareham.\n",
      "Opaque black beer with a medium dark brown head. Heavy aroma; taste starts medium/heavy sweet and ends slightly/medium bitter and dry. Chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and coffee. 8/5/9/5\n",
      "Smooth and refreshing on a hot summer day after yard work. A very even beer. Got it in the throwback cans from “Jaws”. Hey if Quint drinks it then it must be good. Cheers.\n",
      "Coffee on the nose. Black and dense tan pour. Evocative mix of flavours - all those beans are there! Chocolate blends with coffee but the vanilla also maintains its presence among more potent colleagues. Definite bitterness from roasted malts and a vanilla based long finish.\n",
      "375ml bottle @ Josh's. Thanks Charles. Pours an opaque dark brown with a small brown head. Nose is rich barrel notes, light molasses, dark chocolate, and trace bourbon notes. Flavour is intensely complex, great mix of bourbon, with molasses, cocoa, some dark fruits that gives it a cake a like character. Full bodied, soft carbonation, and a moderately high sweetness with and very smooth. That's delicious\n",
      "Again good one from Stone. Really like the cans but this one too. Good one also.\n",
      "One of the best can on the market so far. Really enjoy this one. Great ratings.\n",
      "Really like this one. Sorry it finished so fast. One of the best cane there.\n",

      "Sweet blue berries splash at first taste that quickly transforms into tart snapping mouth watering pucker and then the fruity blueberries dance slowly back in. A clean sour. Delightfully drinkable. A solid sour. Without too much sweetness that some sours acquire when fruits are involved.\n",
      "Delicate color when poured. Great finishing head. Exquisite to the taste on first sip, with a strong but not overpowering flavor. Smooth and easy to drink with solid bite. Highly recommend\n",
      "Acheté au marché Dessaules à St-Hyacinthe. Il s’agit d’une bière rousse translucide qui produit un peu de mousse persistante. Au nez, on sent déjà l’ambiance des fête avec de la cannelle et de la vanille. En bouche, ça goûte le pain d’épice et la cerise avec une touche de chêne. On y retrouve une petite finale boisé et sucré très agréable. C’est ma deuxième bière de Noël préféré ! Je me réjouis du temps des fête pratiquement uniquement grâce à cette bière que je considère comme étant la 4ème meilleure bière overall jusqu’à présent.\n",
      "Sniff the aroma, look at the color, it’s the best ipa in my mind. Perfect, extraordinary, outstanding. The first time you drink ipa, you know you can’t live without it.\n",

      "The aroma of pineapple and funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a slightly hazy golden amber that pours a two finger white head. The alcohol content is 7.4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pineapple pierces the body and gleams the mouthfeel. Mango juices and smoothens the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast provides a fluorescent funky tone. Citra hops adds a lime hue to the pineapple body. Pale malt is tangible to the mango and yeast composition. Chinook hops spices the take and adds to the pine character. Centennial hops are sensible with the pineapple feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neverwhere is an otherworldly Brett IPA. The Citra, Centennial, and Chinook hops combine with the pineapple, mango, and Brettanomyces yeast into a mystical craft beer. The pineapple and mango sparkle upon the comprehension. The Centennial hops and pineapple blend together as the murky funk sets in. The pale malt and Centennial hops infuses with the pineapple profile accentuating the drink. I treasured drinking this beer and amazed by its complexity. This brew is part of a rotation; so, thankfully, it is not a one-and-done.\n",

      "The looks of the beer are nice. It is a typical IPA look. This is what an IPA should look like. The colour is a pale straw yellow. It is a super cloudy beer. Like, super cloudy. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of soft white foam. Foam retention is low-average. A nice drape is left on the beer. Noice.\n",
      "The aroma of the beer is ver nice. It is quite aromatic. Most gluten-free beers I've had tend to be a bit mild in aroma. But not this one. The malts are nice and smooth, with some nice bready notes. There is a hint of caramel. The hops are intense. It has some lovely fruity citrus hop notes. Citrus zest, stone fruit like peach and some passionfruit. It is a juicy fruity bouquet. Very nice. \n",
      "The taste of the beer is also very nice. It is quite a sweet IPA. There are sweet malt notes and also some sweet fruit notes. The hops are nice and bitter, together with a nice sour fruitiness. It is well balanced. It isn't too sweet. The sweetness contributes to the juicy fruit juice aspect.\n",
      "The palate of the beer is also quite nice. Medium body, smooth texture and also nice and creamy. Carbonation is medium. The finish of the beer is very nice. It has loads and loads of tropical fruits and juicy notes. It is amazing. The finish lingers on for a long time, inviting you to drink more and more. So many fruits. I love it.\n",

      "Glass from a bottle at Baladin Bologna, Italy. Pours brilliant brown, like a whisky, fairly sticky in the glass, no foam. Aroma is rich and warning, with wood, caramel, barrel ageing, dry fruits, fig. Body is really dense, with very subtle carbonation and a little spiciness. Quite sticky. Taste is rather sweet, but definitely not boring. Good oxidation. Final is long and sweet, embracing.\n",

Brilliant from start to finish. Magnificent. \n",

With all those hands in the pot this could have been a hot mess (though that's never expected of Modern Times) but it ended up being a perfectly balanced beer, and my favorite of over 2000 new beers in 2019!  I LOVE that the barrel adds to the beer but overpowers nothing.  Vanilla, barrel and peanut butter initially on the nose, cocoa and almond finish.  Coconut throughout.  Perfect thick smooth body.  This could not have been done any better than it was.\n",
      "From bottle at the brewery. Ruby red color no head. Aroma is heavy honey, floral, light alcohol, wood notes?, red fruity, berries and cherries, no tartness in nose. Sweet and light acidic taste. Full oily to sticky body with flat carbonation.\n",
      "From bottle at the brewery. Dark red purplish color with no head. Aroma is sweet and tart fruity, berries - currants, honey, floral. Sweet and acidic taste like aroma. Medium oily body with flat carbonation.\n",
      "One of my favorite beers. Strong aroma of fruits and herbs and a sweet taste with a bit of dryness. Great beer, worth a try.\n",
      "Absolutely love it it's like black coffee and a almond joy melted into one a great beer to warm you up in the winter months most definitely.\n",
      "Sergey's hunt at Ash's, bottle; vintage 2019Black colour. Shockingly good blossom honey; extremely rich flavour, sweet chocolate sauce, honey, harmonious barrel, touch of marasca cherries.Work of art.\n",
      "Sample at Small City Taphouse on 11/9/19. Pours a clear dark purple color with a medium pink head. Aroma of sweet vanilla, dark fruit and honey. Sweet dark fruit and vanilla custard flavor with a dark fruit finish. Magical.\n",
      "Sample at Small City Taphouse on 11/9/19. Pours opaque orange with a medium white head. The nose is straight up creamsicle. Malt and orange flavor with a profound vanilla finish. Great stuff!\n",
      "On tap at Small City Taphouse on 11/9/19. Black pour with a thick tan head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, hazelnut, vanilla and slight bourbon. Malty and chocolatey flavor with hazelnut and bourbon accents before a vanilla and coconut(?!) finish. Really tasty.\n",
      "Very good beer. Loved the taste when it hits the tongue. It’s lighter for an IPA but still has solid flavor.\n",
      "Draft at 8 Degrees Plato. Pours a hazy, almost cloudy, yellow gold with a full finger of white foam that lingers. Pungent nose with citrus, melon, mango and some great yeast action aromas as well. Very in the realm of Monkish or Trillium on the nose. Super inviting. Clean palate...more citrus, papaya, star fruit. Lingering dank, pine & fruit. No hopburn at all, good tropical fruit notes throughout and a little dryness and bitterness on the finish. Fantastic.\n",
      "22oz bottle pours a clear, starbright dark gold, filmy white head.  Nose is dank, honey and flowers first, grass, stinky armpit, vinous too.  Lots happening.  Sweat sock even.  Flavor has all those dank, ripe, BO characteristics, grassy, garlic scapes, some fruit though to help, melon here.  Creamy finish with low bitterness.  Crazy drinkable.  Really nice experience start to finish.\n",
      "Nice ipa. Like cigar city jai alai, my favorite aroma, with tangerine, lime taste. Like body. Strongly recommend.\n",

      "12 oz. bottle from Total Wine, Raleigh, NC (North Hills).  Bottled March 17, 2017.  Murky brackish orange pour with a creamy off-white head.  Aroma of lime zest, apple cider vinegar, and oak.  Taste is outstanding with tons of fresh lime, salt, agave, and oak.  Really everything you could hope for from a beer aged in tequila barrels.  A great beer!!\n",
      "Bottle, hazy golden yellow with full head. Nice lacing. Nose and flavor are Sea shells, lactic lemonade, rain water, inner sprees, Sara’s salty hole, minerals, vitamins, Hill saison. Pure grossness\n",
      "Dark pour with thick foam. Sweet smell of caramel and butterscotch. Taste is sweet with a hint of hops. Very good and delicious  Amazing!!!\n",
      "Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of funky Brett notes with some hoppy floral notes is super enjoyable. Taste is a mix of Brett notes with nice funky notes that pairs well with floral hoppy notes with a dry finish. Body is full with good level of carbonation. This is indeed a world-class Belgian style IPA saison. High level of drinkability with good level of complexity.\n",
      "★★★★½\n",
      "Du poivre au nez.\n",
      "On aime découvrir de bons produits qui nous en mettent plein la vue, plein la bouche ou même plein le nez. Cette blonde bien poivrée nous impressionne par sa douceur épicée. J'aurais peut-être aimé y retrouver un peu plus de punch en finale, mais je dois dire que j'ai grandement apprécié cette bière.\n",
      "Really enjoyed this on tap at brewpub which had a very cool vibe in a nicely repurposed small factory building. Just don't park under the bird-poop-laden radio tower, ha! This beer is a better than average Porter with a substantial roasted malt aroma and flavor.\n",
      "Dark & Wild City. Oak, whiskey barrel and booze. Chocolate, cocoa and earthy taste, slightly boozy, maple and oak, lovely texture, creamy, oily and thick, just a little bit warming. Amazing drink.\n",
      "750ml bottle. Smooth, sweetish and slightly roasty with loads of coconut, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, hops and chocolate, hints of bourbon. Super well balanced mix of a tasty pastry stout and Speedway. Great stuff.\n",
      "A bit very beautiful dark ale, lovely colour and a really stunning toffee flavour\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours black with a medium, dark tan head.  Chocolate and roasted malt are potent in the aroma.  Moderate plum and light licorice are found as well.  The taste is sweet, but not overly so.  Chocolate and roasted elements provide a base for the plum that really pops here.  Underneath are milder licorice, whiskey, molasses, raisin, and traces of oak.  Roasted and plum finish.  Medium in body and with a creamy texture.  Its also remarkably easy drinking, with the overall result is that its wonderfully delicious.  I must consider this among the best beers I've ever had.  It might even top the list.\n",
      "Acquired at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $15.99, Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a wheat ale infused with raspberries crafted by Golden Road Brewing from Los Angeles, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of raspberries, lemon, and tequila are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a reddish purple with a low white head. When held up to light, a ruby red hue glows. The alcohol content is 5.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raspberries fairly sweetens the complexion and lightly tarts the take. Lemon sours the comprehension while citrusy to the touch. Tequila smoothens and tones the drink. Wheat textures the mouthfeel and brings out the raspberries. Oak is sensible upon the tequila and raspberry blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tequila Barrel-Aged Berliner Weisse is a thrilling Berliner Weisse. The raspberries, lemon, tequila, and oak come together into a delicious craft beer. Raspberries and lemon provide a splendid interplay of sour and tart notes. Reposado tequila is discerned which compliments the raspberry and oak notes. The sour and tart are drinkable and easy to experience. I cherished every single drink and enthused by its depth. I would put this down as a bucket list beer.\n",

      "There is s reason this brewery was bought out for 10 bizillion quid, they make great beer. Their Pale Ale is a beautiful malty number that first attracted me to craft beer and the Helles lovely. Indeed it was also like they were missing a family member from India. So This IPA was lost most welcome. It is a lovely fresh fruity beer with great mouth feel. Using a single Hop is a good idea in brewing and this is not exception. Simcoe is a classic choice. Cooper body. Strong lacing. Excellent all round\n",

      "Overall: The maltiness is very strong and complex. Hoppiness is complementary and attenuated due to the aging. The flavor profile is somewhat similar to Golden Pride which balances toward malty sweetness, but this one has more depth. Perfect.\n",

      "Oh my lord. Got this as a gift from my sister from Billie's Bier Festival in Antwerp. This is one of the best imperial stouts I've tasted. The flavour is smooth and complex. You don't notice the 14° alcohol percentage at all. Great for people who love sweet tasting stouts. One of my favourites for sure!\n",

That is a TON of oak! almost firey. wowzerz. This is not quite as complex as 2015's BCS Rare but it surprisingly has a lot more barrel, more carbonation (thank goodness) and a more stout, campfire, charcoal like flavor. It's really delicious sippable and worth savoring. IT's a 2person beer for sure. Not sure I'd want a full bottle myself. The 18% ABV...well hidden.\n",

      "500 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 7.4%. Mahogany colour, moderate off-white to beige head. Lovely aroma of malts, ripe red fruits and dark berries, raisins and sultanas, fruitcake and plum pudding. Rich and malty flavour with the same elements as the aroma, moderate earthy and fruity hops. An excellent and classical English strong ale.\n",

      "Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.\n",

      "Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Color is deep amber with 2\" tan head. Aroma of toffee, caramel, toasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium with a pleasant finish. Flavors of toasted bread, caramel, cinnamon, earthy hops. Overall: outstanding in the style.\n",
      "One of my top Loozyana beers! It’s ￼appearance is absolutely top-notch with beer bubbles abroad. This brew tastes like home.\n",
      "Kolor czarny, nieprzejrzysty. Piana drobna, beżowa, szybko znika. W aromacie dużo czekolady, wanilii, marcepanu. W smaku podobnie. Na pierwszym planie wanilia, potem gorzka czekolada, marcepan, trufle. Aftertaste przyjemny, kawowy, podobnie jak goryczka. Alkohol trochę grzeje. Polecam na krótki leżak.\n",

      "Very interesting and uncommon beer, on one hand is IPA but on other hand very close to stout. Strongly recommended to tasting.\n",
      "This is IPA aroma but in a crisp body lager. The aroma resembles IPA fruity character. Mid carbonation foam on top that fates away quite quickly. Body is crisp, clear, pale amble. Citrus, pineapple, moderate bitterness that is near IPA, but easier to swallow like dry pilsner/lager, and lasting lingering palate of fruity hops and pineapple tones. It's like hybrid between IPA and Lager. I really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Tailgate Peanut Butter Milk Stout has a thick, tan head, a dark brown appearance, and fairly extensive lacing. The aroma is of pretzel, peanut butter, cream, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium, and Tailgate Peanut Butter Milk Stout finishes mostly dry. RJT\n",
      "Awesome stout! Delicious. Tasted the 2016 version, it has improved and didn't think it was possible ;)\n",
      "Light green tint with a thin white head. Lovely tangerine tropical fruity sour nose. Crisp tasty flavor that’s got sweet tangerine and lightly sour citrus undertones and light sour candy finish very lovely.\n",
      "Black pour with a thin tan head. Lovely nose of vanilla icing and maple syrup and chocolate cake. Big rich flavor that’s dark chocolaty and cake like with maple and vanilla.\n",
      "Bottle. Wonderful roasted malt aroma with notes of chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, toffee, oak, vanilla and bourbon. Pours deep brown with a thin mocha brown head that has good retention and good lacing. Starts with luxurious caramel, chocolate, toffee and roasted malt flavors as well as having slick, smooth mouthfeel and rich, full body. Finishes incredibly smooth with dark fruit, oak, vanilla and bourbon flavors as well as a hint of warming booze. Fantastic!\n",
      "Bomber, 2019. Aroma is fudgy, coconut, wood, booze, raisin, licorice, wet stone, cinnamon. Pours inky black with a thin beige head that collapses into a ring somewhat quickly. Taste is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, with lots of coconut and chocolate; some coffee in there, maybe a hint of salt and nuttiness from the almonds, but they're kind of hard to pick out. Not quite the velvety mouthfeel I like in beers like this, and that's pretty much the only negative thing I can say about it. Absolutely delicious, though.\n",

      "330ml glass bottle priced at £3.75 from Drink of Fulham.  Dated as best before 12/03/2021. Served having been out of refrigeration for around 30 minutes into a goblet. \n",
      "\n",
      "A beer I’m building up a lot and very excited about trying. Love the monks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beer pours a deep deep dark mahogany colour with plenty of sediment visible in the glass. Also, despite the dark colour carbonation is visible. The head peaks at around two fingers, varying sizes of bubbles but lots of big ones giving the head a rocky slightly loose consistency. Once dissipated down to a thick wedge worth the body of the head settles to become more consistent with a more uniform rigid appearance. The colour is that of caramel, before it becomes sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma seems deceptive once you have tasted the beer. Traditionally Belgian with yeast, sugar, malts. Fairly simple. On the sweeter side of the spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is beautiful. Dark dried fruits, figs, rasins, yeast, high quality dark chocolate, very light liquorice. Burnt dark brown sugar, lactose. Complex but easy drinking. Up there with the best of the Belgian and Dutch Trappists. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel is unremarkable. I’m writing this review the day after and can’t recall a particular aftertaste just that there was a hint of creamy lactose in coating the palate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, an outstanding beer. Good enough the rival the Trappist big boys in my opinion while maintaining a truly English quality.\n",
      "Color negro, opaca. Dos dedos de espuma marrón cremosa con buena retención. Aroma a malta tostada, café ñ, chili y notas ahumadas. Gusto a malta tostada, café, chocolate negro, praliné, vainilla y avellana, 10 grados totalmente integrados. Cuerpo oleoso. Si la Macchiato era muy buena la Imperial Macchiato es superior, muy equilibrada y sabrosa, un birrón.\n",
      "On tap at Liquid Gold in SF, CA with W Seyffer. Aroma is cherry, balsamic vinegar, spicy funk (like dry aged beef and wood), horse hooves. Taste is tart and funky natural cherries, wood, sweet vinegar, more of that spiced out animal funk. Can still taste this one months later...supreme!\n",
      "Opaque black beer with a slight/medium beige head. Heavy aroma; taste starts heavy sweet and ends slightly bitter and dry. Wheat, banana, chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. 9/5/9/4\n",
      "Excellent Pilsner!  Totally captures the flavors that bring the beverage to life.  One of their better crafts.\n",

Taste chocolate, cookies, brown sugar,  vanilla, hint of whiskey and smoke, figs, and a bit of coffee.palate is surprisingly not that thick. More like 10wt than 50, carbonation subdued. This is sweet and rich, desert for sure, but still surprisingly light considering. I’m 2oz. in and still stunned...\n",

      "\n",
      "Apricots flavor the body and juicy to the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast delivers a dazzling lactic touch after the take and adds a yeasty, funky comprehension. Lemon sours the take and tones the drink. Elderflower colors the yeasty and lemon notes. French oak is noticeable upon the funky, dry finish and tangible to the yeasty profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "20th Anniversary Brett Ale is a resplendent wild ale. The apricots, three Brettanomyces yeasts, French oak, and elderflowers make this craft beer stand out from the sour beer market. After being bottled since 2015, the lactic tinge is sharp and punctuated after the cusp of the drink. Lemons compliments the lactic with sour and tart notes. The French oak becomes prominent over time and the highlight to the complexion. I treasured every single drink and impressed by its complexity. I ended up having a salmon dinner with this brew and paired beautifully with it.\n",

      "More of a hazy double IPA. And really good. Aromas are fresh Citrus hops with a little dank. Flavors are somewhat like nose, Citrus hops upfront turning citrusy sweet with some dank and hints of pine resin. Low bitter great carbonation body in Finnish. Very nice drinking brew.\n",
      "One of the 12 Days of Milkshake Stouts. Pour is nearly black with very little head. Aroma is of maple. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick. Taste has notes of bitter dark chocolate and maple syrup.\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a hazy yellow color with a massive frothy silky creamy head. Aroma is tropical fruits upfront, grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, mango, papaya, pineapple, and a slight sweat bread malt note. Taste follows the aroma with a medium mouthfeel. Very well balanced Ipa and very delicious!\n",
      "Absolutely loved this, grapefruit and mango on the nose, low/medium carbonation so very chuggable but refreshing, great murky body, tastes just as amazing, dry and fruity, medium bitterness with no alcohol burn\n",
      "Tall, thick, creamy-looking khaki head above a deeply black body. The head grows dramatically once the pour stops. The body is so deeply black you barely get any of the typical ruby edges with a backlight. The head has good retention, and leaves disconnected lacing.

There is a slight bitterness in the finish that lingers in the aftertaste for a short while, but dissipates leaving a thick coffee and chocolate, smoothed with lactose, flavors to savor (although the bitterness does become a bit more pronounced in the aftertaste as the beer warms). No hint of the 8.9% ABV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it has a very rich feel and flavor, slightly sweet but never cloying. An excellent sipping beer, decadent enough for an after dinner desert, but not as sweet as describing it as such might imply.  I love this beer.\n",
      "16 ounce can purchased at Hyvee in Cedar Rapids, Iowa while visiting the wife’s family for Thanksgiving ($17.99 for 4-pack).  \n",
      "POURS a quite hazy muddied yellow sunrise hue with a couple fingers of white foam.  AROMA jumps out of the glass with notes of creamy citrus, dank hops, various tropical fruits, some melon and peach, citrus blossom, and old-school Tang.  Juicy juicy FLAVOR of tangerine, mango, pineapple, apricot, dank, honeysuckle, smooth oat-y malts, and other good stuff.  Low bitterness with a soft and creamy mouthfeel that really accentuates the hoppy juiciness.  Finding new Toppling Goliath beers makes coming to Iowa (somewhat) worth it.  And this was one I had long hoped to find.  Really fantastic stuff, expertly showcasing Citra and indeed the whole NEIPA style.  (379, 1156).\n",
      "I had this draft at Big Sur Smokehouse and it was delicious! It has a light golden hue with a mango aroma that isn't too overpowering. The taste is like if you could capture the feeling of walking along a beach on the coast of Bora Bora, with notes of mango, pineapple and other tropical fruits enveloping your taste buds. It has a fresh taste that isn't too sweet and isn't too bitter, but just right! What a great beer!\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Buenaveza is a sumptuous Mexican lager. This craft beer comes across as a plain Mexican beer, but this is an upgrade over a Modelo Especial or Tecate. It reminds me of making salsa, which I drink as I sample each batch I make. I enjoyed this brew and would gladly buy 24 packs of it. What I really want to do next is to make a Michelada with Buenaveza to see how it comes out. \n",

      "750 ml bottle from Tavour, 11/24/19.  Pours a thick, dark brown-black color with a nice sheeting froth of dark brown head atop it.  Leaves plenty of brown lacing on the glass as you sip this deliciously sweet beverage.  Aroma of rich chocolate and cinnamon.  Some light roast as well.  Drinks sweet, like a beautiful cinnamon hot chocolate with some marshmallows floating in it.  Just enough roast to keep it from being a full on sugar bomb, but still this is damn sweet.  The mouthfeel is silk.  Just completely smooth, creamy, and a little rich.  Finishes slightly sticky, which totally works here.  It should honestly be illegal to hide 13.5% this well.  How often is a 13.5% beer burn free and easy drinking?  Good lord, this is dessert beer at it's best.  Skip the hot chocolate, and instead pour this into a snifter, pull up by the fireplace, and enjoy!  This is the best things I've had in the sweet stout game in quite some time.  Doesn't happen to me often these days, but I am just blown away.  \n",

      "So many beers are full of hops these days. It’s nice to a refreshing beer. Wonderful taste and body. Love this beer.\n",
      "Pours flat black with a tiny amount of skimmed foam. Punch of boozy vanilla in the nose, but more complex than that. There's molasses, chocolate and just a general warmth to it. Thick mouthfeel, almost like a melted milkshake. The booziness that you normally have with BCS fades a bit after the two years of aging, but I get a lot of brown sugar, chocolate,vanilla, with some caramel and a bit of a burnt toast in the finish. Listen, you know the beer, it's unreal. I just got a new job for the first time in 9 years, and this is a hell of a way to celebrate it.\n",
      "This is an awesome beer, definitely reminds me of those strong dark scotch ales. Super fruity on the nose. Nice mouthfeel, not too boozy for Belgium. A beer on the re buy list. It's up there with the greats. If you like sweet strong darks your like this.\n",
      "Wow, fantastic intense aroma of dried red berries, oak, caramel & vanilla. Clear dark brown with absolutely no head. Very intense, medium sweet taste, that just keeps on warming for a very long time. Medium body, oily texture & flat carbonation.\n",
      "Incredible taste! I love the colour as I like vibrant and flavoured drinks. Very smooth and almost flat mouthfeel. But the taste is amazing, definitely the best part, not like a beer I’ve tasted before!\n",
      "Bottle from Gedeelde Vreugde - many thanks, Anke! Pours hazy brown with a big, slowly thinning, frothy, tan head. Strong aroma of Sirop de Liège, pear syrup, candied date, caramel, brioche, brandy, molasses, wood. Taste is medium to heavy malty sweet, thick molasses & syrup, fruity notes of candied date & prune, wrapped in brioche, with subtle bitter herbs, toast & wood underneath, the last one giving off a vanilla touch. Dryish, herbal hoppy finish, lingering syrup, dark fruit, wood, warming & rounded brandy- & bourbon-like alcohol. Full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation. Rich, thick, delicious Old Ale.\n",

      "Draft pour, 10 oz enjoyed at the new Tacoma Brewing location.  Beautiful space, beautiful brew.  This is listed as a 7th anniversary brew, barrel aged imperial chili stout.  Adding my rate here until I can really get down to the fine details.  Jet black pour, dark brown cafe foam head.  Dry chili heat over a creamy chocolate.  Flavor has a slight bite to it, which I want it to have.  Its smooth in the middle, but intense on the edges.  Lovely.  The chocolate and chili combine beautifully.  Some cherry notes mixed in.  The heat is perfect.  The ultimate dessert beer for the pepper fanatic.  Its wonderfully warming, the barrels are inpressionable, and dont over or underwhelm the chocolate or chilis.  This is a beer worthy of celebration.  10%, full of delicious chocolate, chili, and barrel flavors.  This is absolutely amazing.\n",
      "Pours a jet black with a thick tan foam head. Aroma is roast, molasses, bitter chocolate, booze, and earth. Flavor is sweet, rich vanilla and molasses, bitter chocolate and roast. Smooth. Delicious.\n",
      "The only reason this beer isn’t rated higher on this site is the hop-blasted palettes of American beer-drinkers. This is a perfect beer for what it is: a malty and subtle and nearly perfect altbier. If you think beer is only over-hopped nonsense, you’re missing out. This is a cheap, delicious and underrated beer and better than the vast majority of shitty IPAs on the market.\n",
      "Can from The Rare Drop, Low Fell, Gateshead. Black with a massive dark tan head of foam. It has a rich peanut butter and chocolate flavour with caramel, nuts and more peanuts on the finish. Superb!\n",
      "Found out of a bottle. Pours oil like, slow and dark black. Minimal dark tan foam. Chocolatety aroma. Great well balanced flavors with a slight booze hint. Great winter option.\n",
      "This beer is a great summer time beer. Very light packed with loads of flavor. Sweet and savory at the same time. Smooth pour with a solid head. Very refreshing with a wonderful aftertaste. Big fan would highly recommend for people wanting to try something different\n",
      "On tap at spacecraft in Sudbury Ontario. Hazy yellow pour with a medium white head. Aroma is blast of freshly cut Plum. Some stone fruit notes are in there too to compliment the intense juicy aromas. Mouthfeel is perfect, carb is more of the same. Finish is beautifully tart, fresh plums, apricot, peach and grapefruit zest. Well done bench, incredible!\n",
      "Refreshing and excellent, let me set the scene. A long day of work, you come to your fridge to have a quiet night in, and the G'had stares you back. After a first sip of liquid gold runs down your throat, the sensation of the worlds best premium lager kicks in, with a rustic taste and a sense of \"bring the outdoors in\", a well rounded refreshing beer. This is water 2.0\n",

      "Very tasty beer. For an IPA it’s very light and smooth. The flavor is abundant but not overpowering to the taste buds. Pours nicely with a good crisp head. Solid after taste leaves you wanting more.\n",
      "Vierte en dorado ligeramente anaranjado y algo turbio. Espuma blanca media de poca persistencia y adherencia.\n",

      "Delicious with notes of chocolate and coffee. Smooth mouth feel and very subtle for an imperial.\n",
      "I could not possibly describe this better than gripweed57. FABULOUS! Strong but a great sipping beer.\n",
      "Bottle. Poured an amber color with no head. Um, heck yes! Key Lime Pie in a bottle.  Citrus, lime, vanilla, crust, honey sticky sweetness and a nice tart finish. I don't know how Pips does it ... I do not like meads (but love all theirs) and I do not like key lime pie (but loved this) ...\n",

      "\n",
      "The wet hop Amarillo hops provide a watery grapefruit sensation to the complexion. Caramel malt textures and flavors the body. Cantaloupe is pungent to the caramel and grapefruit frame. Lemongrass gleams the grapefruit and pine notes. Mandarin oranges compliments the plum and grapefruit blend. A combination of plum and cherry adds a dimension to the comprehension. An earthy, sweet accent colors the caramel feel. Dill flavors the lemongrass and grapefruit characters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coriolis Effect is a beautiful Imperial IPA. The symphony of flavors from the Australian and New Zealand hops, Rakau, Wakau, and Motueka, along with Sorachi Ace hops and Amarillo wet hops are voluptuous to the drink and provide a moderate bitter take. The caramel, grapefruit, lemongrass, and mandarin orange harmonize handsomely together. The plum, cherry, and mandarin orange excites the drink. The lemongrass, dill, and pine dazzles the citrus base. I treasured every drink as the hoppy composition delivers a complex and flavorful libation. The wet hop helps set this IPA apart from such a popular style.\n",

      "Fles 33cl thuis. Sterke koffie, bitter, flink droog, pure chocolade, zoetje, donker fruittonen, flink roasted malts. Goede balans. Goed. Geen doordrinker. (22-11-2019).\n",
      "I am not a fan of having a beer named after a legion of demons (Matt. 12:43-45) but you can't judge a book by its cover.  Pours reddish brown with moderate light tan head that dissipates slowly with good retention.  Powerhouse nose of bourbon, caramel, chocolate, figs, raisins and peat.  Full creamy mouthfeel.  Taste matched the nose with additional notes of bourbon, vanilla, and molasses.  Sweet tasting with nice finish that does not overpower.  Although it says 8% ABV the bottle shop proprietor told me it runs 10%.  In the same class as Founders BBA Backwood Bastard (another unfortunately named beer) which is, IMO, the gold standard for this style of beer.  YUM!\n",
      "Doft av trä och choklad. Otroligt tjock och fyllig smak. Choklad! Sanslöst god!\n",
      "Bottle, 473 ml. Jesus! Something very special. Black w/ brown creamy head. Low in carbo, but the nose is just amazing: chocolate, sweet coffee, vanilla, choco biscuit. The palate is creamy and full, but it's not sweet, but bitter on the end. Really long aftertaste, sweet and bitter in the same time. Absolutely gorgeous, really special flavoured stout. Simply wow!\n",
      "Purchase a 12 pack from my local Rite Aid. Thick white head on top of a pale yellow body. It's really bubbly. It smells sweet, kind of like sweet corn. It's a touch on the dry side but otherwise it's a perfect lager. it's slightly sweet with no hoppy bitterness there's a slight aftertaste I find unappealing but other than that a fine beer\n",
      "Très belle maîtrise de la part de la brasserie The Kernel pour cet Imperial Brown Stout à l'équilibre sans faille et aux arômes de café, chocolat et caramel, intenses et pleins. Une véritable petite gourmandise qui se déguste lentement. Noir total en verre, sans mousse et avec une faible effervescence, nous sommes dans les codes du genre. Le nez présente d'agréables arômes avec une dominante chocolat/noisette agrémentée par du café et du caramel. L'attaque présente un équilibre sans faille, une belle amertume donnant ce qu'il faut de fraîcheur, un alcool à 9,1 % pour mon exemplaire structurant bien la bière, soutenant les arômes et donnant du caractère et un malt intense et dense. Du côté des arômes, le café prend l'ascendant avec du caramel, de la noisette, une pointe pimentée et un chocolat qui se fait plus discret. Excellente corpulence avec en seconde bouche des arômes qui enrobent parfaitement le palais. L’arrière-bouche, davantage sur le chocolat et sur une amertume racée et herbacée, tranche et donne un excellent contraste. Le final, long, nous laisse sur un beau café expresso, racé. J'ai beau chercher, je ne vois pas de faille...c'est une bière où tout est juste.\n",

      "Black pour with a thin tan head. Big nose of bourbon barrel stickiness with coconut and cocoa and woody brown sugar and a hit of vanilla. Rich flavor that’s loaded with chocolate and a little coconut with a light brown sugary woody vanilla tone and a delicious coconutty whiskeyed finish. Tasty as!\n",
      "This beer in a can is a marvel. Like a flyweight boxer - hits harder than you’d imagine. Available to the masses too. Tasty, amber, some fizz and flavour to savour. Well played Vocation.\n",
      "Pours a hazy, orange coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of light biscuity malt and bright, juicy hop aromas of citrus and stone fruit, with notes of orange, grapefruit and peach, as well as just a hint of peppery spice. Taste is a perfect balance of light biscuity malt and vibrant, juicy, slightly acidic and quite dank hops, with citrus, stone and orchard fruit notes of orange, grapefruit, peach and a hint of gooseberry as well, with just a hint of pine and peppery spice coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness and some dank, citrus hops and lighter pine and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Soft, pillowy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fantastic New England Pale Ale with some incredibly vibrant hop notes and full body and mouthfeel for the ABV. Very complex, yet with a perfect balance of sweet, juicy, dank and bitter notes. The dank citrus and stone fruit notes are really complemented perfectly by that typical, dry and somewhat acidic, peppery NZ hop character of white grape and gooseberry here. Such an awesome brew, absolutely loving it.\n",
      "Fresh from last weekend’s 2nd year anniversary celebration, tried it in comparison Crime & Châtiment BBA, the freshness, chocolate/cacao mousse is striking. Quite perfect as taste, even the aroma strikes you straight from the pouring. I got quite the breakfast treat today. Fantastic!\n",
      "On tap at Friendship.  It poured a dark brown color with a tan head.  The aroma was of wood, malts, caramel and some chocolate.  The taste was similar to the aroma with more wood, malts, caramel, chocolate, alcohol, maple with medium carbonation and a nice chewy aftertaste.  This was really good.\n",
      "This is a top 10-15 beer no doubt about it. Wonderful light taste with good flavor. Solid bite but not overpowering at all. Good head, crisp tastes. Highly recommend for beginner pale ale drinkers, and for the more well developed palettes looking for a light new taste\n",
      "Lovely beer here.  Oak and bourbon superbly compliments the base beer.  Really good.\n",
      "Perfect crushable IPA. When you want a good hoppy beer with great flavor but don’t wanna stop after a couple this is the beer for you. Awesome job founders.\n",

      "\n",
      "Apricots are juicy and pungent to the body. Belgian yeast is earthy, spicy, and creamy to the mouthfeel. Hallertau Blanc hops bring a gooseberry like accent to the bitter take. Citra hops flavors the complexion and ventured throughout the drink. Peaches follows and compliments the grapefruit. Lemon slightly sours the take and serves as an undertone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biscuit malt blends well with the Belgian yeast. Caramelized malt sweetens and glistens the creamy and malt base. Pine glistens the Hallertau Blanc hops and lemon aspects to the beer. Clove peppers the take and adds tone to the yeasty comprehension. Coriander is soft to the Belgian yeast hue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Emperor Norton is a succulent Belgian Tripel. The dry hopped Citra and Hallertau Blanc hops, apricots, Belgian yeast, biscuit and caramelized malts, and lemon blend wonderfully together. The biscuit malt, caramelized malt, and Belgian yeast are tasty and dazzling to the drink. Coriander, clove, lemon, and Hallertau Blanc hops deliver a complex comprehension. The pine, lemon, and peaches brighten the hop profile. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. This is a one of a kind Belgian Tripel at a reasonable price.\n",

Lots of rich coffee and chocolate, exceptionally balanced bourbon boozy, creamy, vanilla, some vinous red fruits, light tobacco, lightly bitter. Nice chocolate boozy linger. Good body, low carbonation, velvety soft. Not super huge in flavours, but some of the best balanced beers I've ever drank.\n",

      "500ml bottle, 2016 vintage. Caramel malt aroma with notes of dark fruit, toffee, red wine, oak, vanilla, earthy rye, bourbon and a hint of booze. Pours cloudy toffee colored with a thin tan head that has little retention and no lacing. Starts with rich caramel, toffee, dark fruit and earthy rye flavors as well as having a rich, full body and smooth mouthfeel. Finishes incredibly smooth with vanilla, red wine, oak, bourbon and a little bit of warming booze that’s like a hug on the inside. Wonderful barleywine!\n",
      "12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Familiar aromas of chocolate, coffee, wet hay and woodland, with a little bit of sweet vanilla blended in there. Pours a deep chocolate motor oil brown with two fingers of creamy tan head and good effervescence on the glass. It's a Guinness without a doubt. Really well balanced as you'd come to expect. Not really a big transition in flavors from start to finish. Roast and plum notes are a little more pronounced right on the point of the mid-palate. Nice mild roast with just a touch of sweetness, a bit like cafe au lait. Very easy to drink. Satisfying. Great. Just a little bit sticky. Well done. Keep it up fellas, these new brews you've been doing have all been fantastic. Slainte!\n",

      "Tasted at Prop day. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of cocoa, molasses and spices. You do notice a slight rye spicy bite with some fruity notes. Cocoa, caramel, molasses as well. Very nice goose variant.\n",
      "This is my favorite IPA. Some would say bitter, but the bite is strong but smooth. Leaves a solid aftertaste that makes you want more.  Always pours nice with a good head. The aroma when the cap leaves the bottle is almost orgasmic. Exquisite taste the second it touches the tongue. Would highly recommend for someone who is newer to IPA’s, but have had some experience with heavier beers with rich flavor.\n",
      "Tasted on draft at Prop day. Very nice. Thick black and chewy. Lots of cocoa on aroma and taste. You get a nutty flavor with some vanilla and a little coffee. No hint of high abv. Very smooth. Excellent.\n",
      "Just a simple beautiful taste of freedom. This beer ain’t to expensive but gets the job done with a 5% content of the forbidden syrup.\n",
      "Doppelbock-style beer, light body with low foam and a lot of caramel flavor\n",
      "Simply the best hoppy beer ever made. The tiny bubbles put this IIPA at the top of the beer world!\n",
      "A delicious super hoppy beer that finish’s very smooth!  One of the best!  Need to try.\n",
      "16-oz can from manchesterwineandliquors. huge swiss cheese foamy slowly fizzy head, huge burnt bitter dark fruit nose, creamy, earthy, burnt bitterness, dark fruit, herbal hops, coffee, \"a bite of smoke\", could imagine bourbon, complex, melded great.\n",
      "It does not get much better than a Michelin Ultra. The smooth tasting beer makes it perfect to get a party going, or to even have a SSS function. A Cold Michelob Ultra “hits different” than other beers. It has a unique skinny can, with the same 12 Fluid Ounce amount of beer tasting goodness as it’s opposing brews, while still having a one of a kind taste that can only be described as “Yeah that’s a Michelob alright, can I have another?”\n",
      "The Bud Light Lime has a quality lime taste and is one of my favorite beers. It has a taste resembling a Corona with its lime, and makes the other lime tasting beverages seem shitty, like the White Claw Natural Lime. For a man who enjoys his Beer, this will always be a go to for me.\n",
      "At my niece’s birthday party, Jimi Sepúlveda shared Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard, a strong ale brewed with herbs, fruits, and spices crafted by Stone Brewing from Berlin, Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of pine, grapefruit, caramel, and evergreen are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a brownish amber that pours a finger of beige head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Star anise provides a long lasting bitter spice to the comprehension. The hoppy bouquet compliments the bitter take. Caramel brings a smoothness to the body. Pine glistens the caramel and citrus composition. Jagermeister tones the mouthfeel and imbued with herbal notes. Evergreen is prominent from beginning to end. Thyme is sensible to the Jagermeister and caramel blend at room temperature. Grapefruit and oranges delivers a citrusy tinge to the drink. Oranges become pungent in the dry and bitter finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jagermeister Arrogant Bastard is an otherworldly strong ale. The star anise, caramel, pine, Jagermeister, evergreen, thyme, grapefruit, and oranges come together into a unique craft beer. The Jagermeister and evergreen gleams the caramel and spiced body. Grapefruit and oranges are vibrant on the nose as soon as you pop the cork. At room temperature, the  tart orange and Jagermeister interplay amazingly. I treasured each drink and impressed how well the Jagermeister blends with the Arrogant Bastard. As off base as Jagermeister and a beer together can seem, harnessing it with an Arrogant Bastard works. My father and Jimi contributed to this review.\n",

      "Very dark brown with a light brown, fairly dense head. Aroma: Bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate and caramel. Very complex. Taste: Sweet with decent amount of roasted coffee-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is oily and quite thick. Very nice!\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a big frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is piney, earthy spices, tropical hops. Taste follows the aroma with a sweet bready malt note coming thru in the sip aswel the aroma. Very well balanced leaving heavy malt rings all down the glass. Very tasty hop profile and extremely great malt backbone! Excellent Dipa!\n",

      "Ace & Kees 2019. Bottle. Near black with creamy brown head. Massive sweet deep roasted chocolate malts, cinnamon, palm sugar, coconut shell, sweet woody and nutty. Big sweet and bitter. Full body and creamy fluffy dessert mouthfeel. Crazy.\n",
      "One of the best and most easy To drink beers i ever had, on of the reasons i fly back to London again and again... cant get it here in DK..\n",
      "Going back monday, so you better Stock up on the pubs..🤣\n",
      "Complex profile of dried dark fruits and caramel carries a floral component that evolves into barrel-aged brandy notes. Incredibly silky and elegant, lingering with an element of charred oak spice.\n",
      "Thick and rich, with layers of coconut and cinnamon above creamy bourbon and dark chocolate. Lingers with acidity.\n",
      "Colore mogano scuro, versa un dito di schiuma poco persistente. Aroma tipico di una Quadrupel, con sentori di frutti scuri, spezie, frutta candita e caramello. In bocca risulta complessa e molto ben bilanciata, sentori di frutti scuri, caramello, liquirizia e malto tostato. Finale leggermente amarognolo e speziato. Corpo medio e gradazione alcolica ben nascosta. Ottima.\n",
      "Cinnamon-forward, perfect for Christmas by the fire. There's a blast of chili spice to balance the sweetness. Also deepens with cocoa flavors as it lingers with spice. Bourbon is present but very understated, adding texture, creaminess and complexity. Cinnamon dominates through the long finish.\n",
      "Dark amber color with generous beige foam for good retention. Aromas of caramel, wood, ripe plum and maybe some cloves. In the mouth it is very alcoholic, flavors of intense roasted caramel, wood, past bone fruit\n",
      "Hazy, a lot of carbonation, 3 fingers white and creamy head. Aroma of wheat, cloves, a bit smoked, a bit of banana. Balanced taste, refreshing, good carbonation, stingy. For the most part we have cloves, spicies, yeast and wheat. Some fading banana and honey. Sweet aftertaste with a lot of cloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clean, clear taste. Pleasant mouthfeel and carbonation. No unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste. Very enjoyable.\n",
      "From backlog. Taster from bottle at bottleshare, Escondido, Ca. Black with beige head. Roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, nuts, barrel, rum, sweetness, chilli sting.\n",
      "Slightly hazy deep amberish hue with a thin ivory head. Lovely nose of whiskey and fruity dark English malt. Lots of vanilla and raisin and wood. Big flavor that’s a little warm and alcohol phenolic with lots of wood and whiskey and loads of raisin and plum. Lingering tones of dark plummy malt and wood and vanilla.\n",
      "From backlog. Taster from bottle at bottleshare, Escondido, Ca. (As 2019 Vintage) Black with little beige head. Roasted malts, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, sweetness, and some bitterness. Super nice!\n",
      "Not as good as a Spotted Cow but the price is great and a good farmhouse ale. Has a slight wheat taste.\n",
      "Brilliant clear pale golden with a sticky white head. Lovely nose that’s got notes of fresh cut grass and a little lemon peel and fresh hoppy citrus bites. Crisp bright pale dry flavor that’s effervescent but loaded with lemony grassy floral piney citrusy hops. Really pops with lemon peel and fresh hoppy grass tones. Amazing.\n",

      "Prop Day!  November 17, 2019 - sampled at Goose during the event.  Dark brown pour with limited head.  Aroma was tart cherry, bourbon, sweet and chocolate. Taste was consistent with the aroma, but more tart than sweet and also was slightly nutty.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of toasted coconut, rich dark chocolate, barrel. Taste is incredible, like a Bounty bar but with rich dark cacao, toasted coconut, rum, oak, spice, dark fruits, sugar, honey, warming alcohol, sweet. Full bodied, thick, smooth. Exceptionally well balanced, everything feels just right. A perfect, faultless stout. Sublime.\n",
      "Highly recommended for ex military stuff. Recommendations by airborne. 😃😃😃\n",
      "Just like scrump Jack crisp and clean found it in a local off license in wednesbury west mids\n",
      "Clear amber ale, substantial white head. Aroma of pale malt and hint of citrus. Tastey malt, juicy orange and grapefruit. Palate medium rich, carbonation average.   Always a fan of the more classic IPA's and Pliny is top shelf!\n",
      "Pours dark black, slight cream head. Nose of chocolate, cherries and a bit of prune. Nice robust mouth feel. Loaded with chocolate along with a well integrated sense of light molasses. Finishes slightly bitter, and very long chocolate finish that goes on and on and on. Superb!\n",
      "Not only does Neon Totem: Painkiller have a cool can it is one of my favorite sours.   Slight pucker rating but not overpowering and has a subtle fruit flavor similar to you guessed it a Painkiller.\n",
      "As the description says Variant's Cashmere is a very soft and smooth IPA and I will add with excellent hop characteristics.\n",
      "One of the best beer i've ever drunk. Like an ambrosia, perfect balance, incredible taste.\n",
      "One of the best beer i've ever drunk. Like an ambrosia, perfect balance, incredible taste.\n",
      "Purchased at Famila Lübeck, Germany. Pours dark amber into the glass with a white head. More fruity and slightly sweeter than the traditional saison, but hey, when the beer tastes this good, who cares?\n",
      "Last time I had this it was over 3 years ago and I have excellent memories of it. Let's see now. Pours black, minimal head and little lacing. Strong peanut butter biscuit and chocolate aroma with bourbon and vanilla notes. Thick to the palate, boozy, lot of roast, chocolate, peanut butter, vanilla and bourbon quite outstanding. It doesn't have the glamour of the classic Yellow Belly, but it's possibly better.\n",
      "Cloudy golden with a thick rocky white head. Lovely nose that’s lightly resinous and fully tropical with a little gooseberry and pineapple and juicy floral fruity tones. Smooth fluffy flavor that’s wheaty and pale with nice tropical flavors throughout. Melon and gooseberry and pale juicy the fruit.\n",
      "Bought at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $19.39, Brasserie Noir is an imperial stout aged in Cabernet barrels for up to 12 months crafted by Goose Island Beer Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of tan head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark brown shows. The alcohol content is 11.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is fair and harmonizes with the roasted malt frame. Molasses thickens the body, enriches the chocolate, and tasted when you lick your chops. Mocha bitters the take and textures the mouthfeel. Vanilla is creamy and brings out the plums used. Figs are noticeable as you go into the finish. The Cabernet flavors the mocha finish. Red currant adds a slight tartness to the brown sugar and coffee bitter take. Oak is distinguished upon the molasses and malty composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brasserie Noire is a tantalizing imperial stout. The chocolate, molasses, mocha, vanilla, plums, figs, red currant, and Cabernet combine into an extraordinary craft beer. The molasses and mocha ravishes the take. The vanilla provides a domineering creaminess that makes this libation drinkable. At room temperature, the Cabernet becomes the highlight to the complexion. I treasured each drink and dazzled by its depth from cold to warm. I think the best serving temperature is at room temperature. At 11.8% and a 765mL bottle, I shared this beer with my father who corroborated in this review.\n",

      "Bottle from Beers Of Europe. Clear deep ruby body with a beige head. Lively carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of raisin, mashed strawberry and toffee. Flavour of burnt sugar, Calpol and boiled blackcurrant sweets. Medium to full body with a sticky, chewy mouthfeel. Light fizz. Sweet and delicious.\n",
      "Bottle at home in Hackney - sourced via trade. Pours oily black with a small, foamy tan head. Spectacular beer, incredibly layered, dense but not cloying, lots of nice lightly bitter chocolate, vanilla accents, fudge, dark coffee, background earthy cinnamon. Full bodied, oily and chewy, with fine carbonation. Lightly warming finish, more decadent cocoa character, soft roast, rocky road, toasted marshmallows, mild earthy bitterness, coffee ice cream, a little bitter ash, too. Outstanding.\n",
      "De botella en Beerhouse. Color negro con leve halo de espuma color marrón oscuro. Potentes aromas a cacahuetes tostados, muy natural y muy agradable, chocolate negro, alcohol y un leve picor a regaliz. En boca es densa y oleosa, el alcohol pega pronto, dulcísimos sabores a mantequilla de cacahuete, madera, chocolate, bizcocho borracho y azúcar. Retrogusto ardiente y alcohólico, amaderado, bien equilibrado. Si la Yellow Belly estaba buena, esta está aún mejor.\n",
      "2015 bevuta nel 2019. Si presenta marrone massiccia senza alcuna schiuma. L'aroma è intenso di malto, caramello, leggere note tostate e minimamente affumicate. La bevuta è splendida, con una base maltata importante, liquoroso, piena, dolce quasi sciropposa. Corpo molto rotondo, con finale quasi tendente al fruttato.\n",

      "Truth has a thick, off-white head of foam, a brilliant gold-orange appearance, lots of powdery sediment, and heavy glass lacing. The aroma is of hop resins & white bread crust, and the flavor is similar, with strong bitterness. The mouthfeel is high medium, and Truth finishes mostly dry. RJT\n",
      "Fantastic. Peach inside, good flavor. Definitely it worth a 100 try. You will never get disappointed.\n",

      "It smells a bit like candy canes. Very similar to other strong ales such as King goblin. Leaves a bit of an aftertaste for a while (in a good way). A bit of a tang on the end of my tongue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well worth getting 4 for £6 at supermarkets of this ale. It's a huge favourite anyway, but the ultimate experience would be on a cold winters afternoon with perhaps a bit of fog and ground frost, taking a bottle into rural country fields and savouring it. Perhaps even used as one for the start of a session that's followed by session ales. \n",

      "Let sprittet. Mørke malte og europæiske humler. Er ikke alt for god i humlen i eftersmagen.\n",
      "Impatto visivo piacevole, un bel nero impenetrabile, schiuma abbondante, fine color cappuccino ma poco persistente. Al naso notevoli note di caffè in polvere e qualche nota di cacao. In bocca spicca per un corpo importante, subito si sente il gusto da caffè addolcito da note di cioccolato e vaniglia. Retrogusto abbastanza amaro di caffè.\n",
      "Muito suave, baixa acidez e caramelizada, excelente cerveja que não necessita acompanhamentos.\n",
      "Beaucoup de volonté  avec cette bière qui mousse abondamment. In liquide noir et une dentelle épaisse et éparse. Ça sent vraiment bon; un mélange de grains grillés, de rainette de type chinotto avec ses touches de zeste d'orange. Un peu de menthe aux côtés d'autres herbes aromatisantes, de houblons et d'herbes. Des saveurs semblables tout en étant différentes à la fois: amères de la façon douces et acidulées, sans astringence, des conifères d'automne remis de sève, de réglisse noire, fruitées comme dans certain cocktail, boisées doucement. Collante et corpulente. C'est délicieux. J'ai adoré! (E 29/04/19 D661-662) (2895-270919)\n",

      "\"Barrel-Aged Stout- for consideration. Imperial Stout aged in freshly dumped Kentucky Bourbon Barrels. 13% ABV 14 IBU\".\n",
      "The Aromas are exactly what the label says a blend of barley wine and Imperial Stout. Cocoa, roast, nougat, Oak, coffee and dark malt. Flavors are much more sweet than bitter, a hint metallic at first, soft but good carbonation Lush body with coffee in the Finish and a little booze. Amazing beer.\n",
      "My favorite beer if 2019!!! The perfect balance of west coast/east coast style IPA just makes my mouth water.\n",
      "Super malty caramel flavors pop with sweet candy flavor. Stays clean and drinkable though. Super dark mahogany pour. Some beige head. Just amazing.\n",
      "500 ml can. Pours a clear gold color with thick white head and great retention. Good lacing. Grain and malt aroma. Lively carbonation. Lightly sweet, smooth lager flavor with creamy, bready finish. Really clean mouthfeel. Medium body. Not bitter. Great beer! Infinitely repeatable. Prost!\n",
      "Bomber from Tavour shared by my daughter. Nose is pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, nuttiness, and cinnamon. Black with a medium cinnamon tan head. Flavor is moderately sweet pumpkin pie with spices and a hint of bitter from the syrupy body. Pretty nice.\n",
      "Obtained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $21.99, Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a coffee stout fermented and barrel aged in French oak barrels brewed by the Libertine Brewing Company from San Luis Obispo, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields acidity, lemon, Brettanomyces funk, and chocolate upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a finger of beige head. When held up to light, the surface shifts into a dark brown hue. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lemony, citrus body greets you with a sourness on the take followed by a lactic mouthfeel. Cherries sweeten the complexion and adds a tart to the take. As the lemon mellows, chocolate malt provides a discernible texture to the comprehension. Roasted malt accompanies the chocolate. Lactose brings a light, silky tone to the malty base. Espresso accents the chocolate and lactose while slightly bitters the comprehension. Brettanomyces yeast dries and funks the lemon and cherry finish. French oak delivers a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic bouquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a ravishing coffee stout. The lemon, cherries, chocolate malt, lactose, espresso, and funky Brettanomyces yeast blend amazingly into a one of a kind beer. The combination of sour, tart, and acidity is easy to experience and beautiful to the malty frame. The lactose eases the drink. The espresso and French oak are dazzling to the malty feel. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity. In the end, this brew is more sour than stout, so be informed before buying this bottle.\n",

      "Les épices sont bien présentes et le niveau d’alcool (10,5) n’est pas agressif. C’est noël quoi !\n",
      "Très belle couleur assez foncé, goût de café torréfié et noix en subtilité. \n",
      "Juste servi trop froid bar de ITHQ. Par contre après avoir laisser réchauffer un peu les arômes changés. A essayé à la température recommander là prochaine fois à plus\n",
      "This beer is so good. The oats in the brew make is so soft and smooth. Not as juicy as some of the milkshake styles out there but still very flavorful with the hop blend being that perfect combination of floral and just a little bitter. The first sip is so good but its one of those beers that gets better as you finish your pint. There are so many good beers out there but it would be on my short list if I had to choose a single beer to drink for the rest of my life.\n",
      "Its no secret that I like NEIPAs but this one is special. First it hits you in the nose in all the right kind of juicy ways. It is smooth but not to thick and taste is as juicy as the aroma. You can still appreciate some subtle bitterness in addition to the juice bomb. It is the clean finish that really makes it stand out. No bite and not boozy. Super tasty!\n",
      "Bionda quasi ambrata, opalescente. Schiuma candida, fine e persistente. All'olfatto note erbacee, fieno luppolo fresco. Un piacevole amaro alla bevuta non troppo spinto e invadente, secco, non molto persistente ma che invita al prossimo sorso. Notevole al gusto la nota erbacea.\n",
      "Fruktig doft och smak med inslag av aprikos och citrus. Ofiltrerad grumlig veteöl. Balanserad, brödig eftersmak. Utmärkt veteöl. #1526.\n",
      "Jet black ink color on pour, small dark beige head. Deep malty, strong dark chocolate and mild coconut aroma. Very smooth on mouthfeel. Smooth chocolate,  coconut, vanilla and herbal flavor. Wonderful balance. Very mildly sweet. Fantastic. Extremely well done. Quite pricey.\n",
      "Robert. Robert. This beer is fuckin' wonderful Robert. Bin off the daft children come back to mine. Perhaps kiss the buckle and then we shall kiss the alderman Robert. x\n",
      "Steel Reserve Alloy Series Spiked Watermelon (285 calories) has a thin, white head, a clear, bubbly, and a rose appearance, with some glass lacing, believe it or not. The aroma is of citrus acid, maybe watermelon, pale malt, & sourness (?). Flavor is similar, with lots of sweetness & no bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Steel Reserve Spiked Watermelon finishes medium dry. RJT\n",
      "A classic delicious Wisconsin beer, maybe my favorite beer. Very nice refreshing ale with bright fruity notes and a decent bitter bite. Perfect with bratwurst during a Packers game!\n",
      "When I had just thought that the Knob Creek Rye version was the best thing I had drunk in 2019 it came this. Well, I put them on the exact same level as basically is the same beer, but the apple brandy aroma is pretty amazing. It's black, firm tan head and great lacing to eat with a spoon. Nose is apple brandy and chocolate. Tastes sweet, roasted barley, chocolate, wood, apple brandy, dark fruits. Flavours linger viscously for hours, without even noticing its booze. Get some wood in the after taste, when, after 3 months, the flavours are vanished. Excellent!\n",
      "So far the best NA beer I have had. Flavor and aroma have both citrus and pine. Mouthfeel is nice and full for 0.5%. The hops coat your mouth after a drink.\n",
      "It's black, with a very firm, persistent and lacey tan head. Gorgeous. Strong vanilla, whiskey and chocolate on the nose. Lot of toastiness, roast-bitter but also sweetness and molasses. Vanilla and whiskey take over, they go through chocolate, dark fruits, figs and spices, lingering in the after taste. It's a beauty to sip, thick and viscous, with a whisky throat & esophagus burn that dies in a warm explosion of flavours. For sofa sessions. Outstanding!\n",
      "Pours opaque brown with a chocolate chip cookie sized ring of head. Cocoa,roasted malts ,toast dominate the aroma. Strong full bodied rush or bitter chocolate and malt sustanance. Bitterness remains, not herbal annis, but not just a hop bitterness either. Nice combo. The oft forgotten imperial porter, a style I can really get behind.\n",
      "Orange waxed bottle. Poured a near black color with a smaller sized tan head. Oak, wood, vanilla, dark fruits, chocolate, and lighter booziness. Nice.\n",

      "22oz bottle. Bottle #5/20. Nice club - you tell them what to do with the base beer. This one was the BOMB! Vanilla, bourbon, coffee, marshmallow, chocolate, dark fruits and more marshmallow fluff.\n",
      "\n",
      "22oz bottle. Poured a near black with a small sized off white head. Um, yeah .. exactly as described and better. Neapolitan, strawberries, vanilla, bourbon, waffle cones (just because its in the name), chocolate .... so much going on that is spot on. Alcohol content hidden.\n",
      "Sample at Wolfstock on 9/28/19. Pours an opaque yellow to orange color with a thin white head. Nose of malt, funk, lime and orange. Malt and lime flavor with pineapple and orange accents before a sour citrus finish. Best beer of the day. Truly special.\n",
      "Bottle sampled in line at Wolfstock on 9/28/19. Pours darkest brown with a medium light brown head. Aroma of malt, chocolate, hazelnut, almond, vanilla and bourbon. Malty and chocolatey flavor with dark fruit accents before a nutty and boozy finish.\n",
      "This has to be my favourite beer - YUMMY YUM YUM very satisfying with a decent kick too , plenty of that tangy citra hoppiness that I've recently discovered - can't wait to open the next one , this beer is.........................Well just try one and see for yourself !\n",
      "on tap at the brewery; hazy gold color; great juicy, citrusy hop aroma; fantastic, juicy, citrusy hop flavor; really smooth for a high gravity beer; medium bodied\n",
      "Dark brown in colour. Smells sweet and chocolatey. Taste is slightly sweet, malty and chocolatey with a coffee and nutty after taste. A master piece of a beer :)\n",
      "Bought this beer from Tesco superstore in Nottingham , you get 4 bottle for £6, you just truly cannot believe the lovely smooth taste of this ale when you consider the rather huge strength, 7.3 %..!! It tastes more like a smooth 4.5 % ..sweet after taste on the tongue. I'm a huge fan of this champion beer from guys who have proved they know there oats :)\n",
      "light but complex salt and smoke really come through not too sour amazing balance ethereal floats away pleasant finish\n",
      "caramel malts and caramelised apple Highish carbonation bitterness but mild and v controlled the sweet fruit dominates - like a calvados thick and rich mouthfeel\n",
      "Lovely quadruple IPA style high abv beer, full bodied, very sweet, with a light cloudy amber appearance. A nice head about two-three fingers if poured quick. Head retention is moderate, eventually fizzles out after 5 mins or so. A lovely aromatic citrus full of hops aroma. The taste is very citrus hop dominated, am guessing they have used on their own or in combination,citra, cascade,  chinook and amarillo hops in large quantities, this hoppy beer is perfectly balanced though with a sweet fudge malt background. Make no mistake, this is a heavy full and sweet beer, the sweetness is unavoidable at these abvs, due to the unfermentable maltodextrin sugars typical of a heavy abv beer.  But its all finely balanced and very drinkable, this is like taking brewdogs triple ipa and putting it on steroids! Overall a very pleasing and warming beer.\n",
      "Got this as a freebie at work. Absolutely love it. After chilling, it’s so smooth and refreshing to drink. Great aftertaste and really pleasing on the palate. My new favourite.\n",
      "Aromat intensywny, orzechy, czekolada, kokos, wanilia, delikatnie rum i beczka w tle.\n",
      "W smaku delikatnie słodkie, czekolada, słone orzeszki, kokos, dalej wanilia, bardzo delikatnie rum, alkohol prawie niewyczuwalny.\n",
      "Spoiler alert na dwa następne posty, piwo panelu dla mnie, orzeszki, kokos i czekolada świetnie się tu łączą, do tego beczka po rumie bardzo delikatna, sztos.\n",
      "Dobra ostatni post na dziś i ostatni z tamtego panelu. Piwo szczególne, bo 20,58% alkohol, 4 krotnie leżakowana w beczce po burbonie i zdecydowanie najdroższe jakie próbowałem w życiu.\n",
      "Aromat intensywny, wanilia, czekolada, burbon, kakao i nuty drewniane.\n",
      "W smaku delikatnie słodkie, czekolada, kakao, wanilia. Burbon wyraźnie czuć, ale z drugiej strony piwo ma over 20% i są to jednak nuty szlachetnego alkoholu, a nie spirytusowe rozgrzewanie.\n",
      "Bardzo ciekawe piwo, 20% bez wymrażania to mocny wyniki. Bardzo gładkie, czekoladowe, tak czuć ten alkohol, ale piwo jest na tyle ciekawe że mu się to wybacza.\n",

      "Taurus, Taurus, Taurus that is my life now, I aspire to be the worlds greatest Taurus drinker, I love it. I am always drunk, because Taurus is this magical drink which has supernatural powers. you drink this, you will then become a top shagger . simples. if you thought jay from inbetweeners was the ultimate clunge magic, you're wrong with a pear Taurus in your hand the birds can't turn you down, in come fly with me Taaj had \"pussy waggon\", and in real life you can have the pussy waggon\" its just car full of Taurus.\n",

      " I love Taurus, you love Taurus, we all love Taurus\n",
      "I am a consistent Taurus drinker ! I have Taurus flowing through my veins, its in my blood stream at this point and I love it ! when I wake up in the morning with my morning wood, I'm thinking about Taurus. 50p a 440ml can which is 4% (however I prefer the 4.8% pear cider, that's the one which turns me on), if you need a good shag just bring 20 of your finest Taurus to the party and the bitches will be drooling. others whom rate the Taurus lowly are on the spectrum, its as simple as that. if you are in need of simple yet complex drink whilst shagging birds Taurus is for you !\n",

      "12-oz can from craftbeertemple. good slowly fizzy foamy head, row of lace, huge hazelnut nose, creamy, huge super nutty hazelnut, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, melded great, grew on me, upgraded.\n",
      "On tap @ Carwyn Cellars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours a jet black with a light beige head. Aromas are big in dark chocolate, coffee, wood, caramel and bourbon-ish notes. Flavour is massive in dark roasted malts, yet it is super well balanced with all the other flavours. Drinks like a dream. If all the other Black Buttes are like this, i'll be buying them by the dozen.\n",
      "2016 vintage on tap @ Carwyn Cellars.\n",
      "Pours a jet black with a dark brown head. Aromas are super rich in oak, liqourice, spices and dark roasted malt. Taste is an explosion of amazing flavours. Chocolate, caramel, liqourice, molasses, oak, some bourbon / whiskey notes and other herbs and spices. All of this is over a huge backbone of dark roasted malt. Aftertaste is bitter but amazingly delicious. I can see what all the hype is about. Can't wait to have it again! Have 2017, 2018 and 2016 (Scotch) in the cellar so might need to continue raising the rating.\n",
      "Tasted from bottle aged 4 years. Pours black with minimal head that fades quickly. Definitely blackberries on aroma along with cherry, cocoa and molasses. Flavors of cherry and berries, molasses, caramel, cocoa, and a little coffee like notes. Awesome beer.\n",
      "Can at home in Hackney - picked up at Clapton Craft. Pours hazy orange-gold with a frothy, white head. Gorgeous southern hemisphere hop character, nice tangerine, cat pee, mango, light rindy bitterness, apricot, peach. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Lovely finish, more vibrant southern hem hops, tangerine, pee, subtle pine, peach. This is an immaculate riwaka expression. My goodness.\n",
      "Attained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.50, Twisted Monk is a Belgian-style abbey ale with cherries crafted by Dust Bowl Brewing Company from Turlock, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of caramel, cherries, and Belgian yeast are noted as you drink. The appearance is purplish and clear that pours a minimal white head. When held up to light, a reddish purple glows and reveals tiny particles of sediment. The alcohol content is 7.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherries bring a domineering flavor to the body and lightly tarts the take. Caramel is smooth and soft in tone. Belgian yeast creams the cherry and caramel complexion along with an earthy and spice touch to the comprehension. Toffee is drawn out from the Belgian yeast profile. Plums are distinguished from the yeasty and caramel finish. Dates add another sweet touch to the cherries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twisted Monk is an enticing Belgian-style abbey ale. The cherries, caramel, toffee, Belgian yeast, plums, and dates come together into an illustrious drink. The cherries and dates do not come across too sweet and gives the complexion a nice touch. The Belgian yeast and toffee combination brings a lovely tone to the malt and cherry frame. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast integrates handsomely with the tart. I loved drinking this beer and mesmerized by its complexity.\n",

      "Bright very cloudy orange from the can.  Aroma is pineapple mango and citrus, lightly dank.  Flavor the same, and the feel is off the charts good, with very little alcohol showing.  Most impressive Trillium beer in some time!\n",
      "Clear golden with a frothy head.\n",
      "Wheaty smell. Wheaty taste with a decent bitterness, little acidity and a clove note. Medium carbonation.\n",
      "This is only the third Kristallweizen I ever tasted in my life. Having been disappointed by the two first I wasn't expecting much of this one, but in the end it's a very fine beer.\n",
      "Bottle, nose is almond, dried fruit, marzipan, brown sugar, bourbon, hint of brandy and red wine: as it breaths a huge Christmas cake nose develops. Taste is brown sugar, bourbon, marzipan, apple, fruit, vanilla, caramel, a little bread,, sweet malt, spice, touch of cream dried fruit. Fruit cake. Faint smokiness and leather add depth, warming alcohol finish.  Red wine notes emerge as it warms and touch of sherry / vinious. \n",

      "It's a complex beer that changes as it breaths, and the flavour profile could have been designed for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Outstanding\n",
      "Bottle, 355 ml shared with Miro B and Max. Black with tan head. Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, nice bourbon character, sweet with bitter finish. Full bodied. Complex and well rounded.\n",
      "Color nero impenetrabile con schiuma beige a grana regolare e dalla buona resistenza. All’olfatto si presentano aromi di tostature, frutta secca, cioccolato, caffè, liquirizia e un’accenno di vaniglia.\n",
      "Ingresso dolce, passaggio di frutta scura, poi entrano in scena tutti i toni delle tostature con un tocco di acidità. Il finale è secco ed amaro. Retrogusto ricco di tostature. L’abv scalda e coccola con l’aumento della temperatura nel bicchiere. Sorso capiosamente ricco, muscoloso ma vellutato e rotondo, carbonazione media. Deliziosa!\n",

      "Light yellow liquid. Scent of hay, herbs and yeast. Light mouthfeel with stale tones. Barrels, grass and resin acid.\n",
      "Genius. A delicious light beer that downplays the sickly maltiness and emphasizes citrus bitter hops. And it’s 3.0!  In the day of 8.0 beers that being on an instant headache, this beats out all the season beers. Only downside, hard to get drunk if that’s your thing\n",

      "Czarne, nieprzejrzyste, gęste jak olej. W aromacie całkiem ładnie, główne skrzypce gra beczka, słodycz, wanilia, a wszystko dopełnia sos sojowy. W smaku przekozacko. Ultragęste, jak lekko wodnisty kisiel, niesamowicie słodkie. Ogrom czekolady, wanilia, karmel i cukier trzcinowy. Nisko nasycone, gładkie, cudownie wypełnia podniebienie. #teamcukrzyca\n",
      "Avec son piment pour le relever, et ses fèves de cacao et ses grains de cafés pour lui donner de l'intensité cet Bomb est assez détonante. Force et caractère caractérisent donc cet Imperial Stout qui se déguste lentement. Elle possède juste un peu trop de sucre à mon goût. En verre, la bière est d'un noir total, quasiment sans effervescence. Le nez est plein, sur le chocolat, le café, le piment, la vanille, le caramel et des accents de noix de coco. L'attaque présente de suite une intensité remarquable. L'amertume, avec 65 d'IBU, permet de conférer une bonne fraîcheur pendant que l'alcool à 13 % donne de la chaleur tout en soutenant convenablement les arômes. Les 13 % ne se ressentent pas réellement, l'alcool étant bien intégré. On retrouve les cocktails présents au nez avec un piment que j'aurais préféré un peu plus atténué. On continue ainsi en deuxième bouche. Le piment donne quant à lui chaud aux papilles en arrière-bouche. Pas de réelles évolutions aromatiques toutefois. La corpulence est par contre assez exceptionnelle. Bel étirement sur le final avec des arômes qui restent longtemps n bouche. Merci à Vincent pour cette découverte.\n",
      "Brownish red with dirty white foam. Scent of malt, dried fruit, cinnamon, herbs and spices. Taste of malt, dried fruit, bread, orange and spices. Medium size bitter. Very smooth and full.\n",
      "Protagonism of a rich maltose profile, with biscuit memories, in which alcohol and a balanced hops are perfectly integrated\n",
      "2019 vintage. Pours a dark copper color; small head; pleasant aroma with fruity, woodsy overtones. Heavy cherry flavor. Mild on the palate and throat. This is an atypical ale with a flavor that will appeal to the aficionado. Best enjoyed with cheeses and good friends. \n",

      "---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone\n",
      "I was looking forward to this Imperial Milk Stout. The sweet, high gravity (boozy) aroma jumped out of the bottle after I opened it and became much and became more fragrant after I poured it into an English Pub glass. It’s a very dark, opaque stout with a thin tan head. Tastes like a sweet high gravity stout with notes of raisin, cinnamon and vanilla blending together with a hint of bourbon, creating an outstanding mouth feel. It’s not your typical stout, but I enjoyed it very much!\n",
      "Un Unicornio doble porfavor!!!! Revision nunca dejará de sorprenderme, su glitter moon me tiene viendo doble unicornios, gran aroma, muy tropical, fácil de tomar, deliciosa, me mudaré a un lado de ellos. Definitivamente puedo sentir el alcohol un poco pero no para ser una distracción. Felicidades Revision los amo!!!!\n",

      "massive bourbon flavour without the burn massive quality vanilla bean flavour, fantastic long finish lovely and sweet with very very little bitterness or the syrupy thick quality that often comes with high alcohol nuanced but also very drinkable. Milk and caramel\n",
      "Intensive, well-dry aroma, quite dry, fresh herbs, quite a few pine trees, young shoots, needles and resin, banana, some caramel and toffee, but in rather dry forms, pleasant.\n",
      "Pours dark brown with little beige foam. Fragrance of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and a good base of dark fruit. On the palate, toasting, cocoa, vanilla, tobacco and light hops.\n",

      "\n",
      "Malbec grapes have a ravishing, flavorful hue to the body. Brettanomyces yeast follows the fruity grapes with a soft funky touch along with a lactic tart tinge to the mouthfeel. Plums rounds out the body before the beer starts waning into the dry finish. Lemon provides a light citrus feel that compliments the lactic yeast and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the yeast, grape, and lemon frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primrose is an exquisite hybrid ale. The Malbec grapes, funky Brettanomyces yeast, plums, and lemon blend together into a spectacular craft beer. The Malbec grapes and funk harmonize tastefully. Plums brings a fullness to the wine-like Malbec body. The sour and tart are easy to experience and pleasant to the complexion. I absolutely loved drinking this beer. The blend of wine and beer is exemplary. This is an outstanding craft beer; do not pass this up if you manage to find it.\n",

      "On tap at source. Pours jet black with a dirty tan head clinging to the glass. Aroma is chocolate, cinammon, maple syrup, treacle, coffee. Taste is a big coffee hit with chocolate and maple mellowing out the bitter roast coffee leaving a sweet maple syrup finish. A hint of booze but so well balanced. Absolutely stunning.\n",

Eteriska estrar, gyllene säd, jästkultur, honung, jord, kalk, blommig nektar. En riktigt bra livlig trippel som har allt man kan önska i stilen. Spritsighet, balans, smakdjup. Riktigt riktigt gott.

      "Toute bière Trappiste est toujours un événement. Et d'autant plus lorsque les moines nous offrent un tel breuvage. Une chose est certaine, il y a du belge dans celle-ci. Les moines anglais ont dû prendre quelques conseils auprès de leurs frères belges. Bonne complexité, beaux arômes de fruits et de malts grillés, bonne présence en bouche. Cette trappiste possède de nombreux points forts. Je ne vois qu'un seul bémol pour qu'elle soit splendide, un alcool, à 7,4%, quelque peu limite pour soutenir parfaitement les arômes. Visuellement, c'est une robe brune qui se présente à nous. Une fine couche de mousse nappe la surface. Le nez est sur la prune, la poire, la mélasse, le chocolat, de légères épices et l'alcool donnant un trait de caractère. L'attaque est sur un excellent équilibre avec un alcool faisant un peu plus que son titrage. On y retrouve des arômes fruités (poire, pruneau, banane), alliés à des arômes de chocolat, de caramel et un poivre relevant le tout (ce dernier étant peut-être un brin trop présent). L'alliance est remarquable. La deuxième bouche gagne en intensité tout en devenant un peu plus douce (c'est à ce moment qu'un alcool un peu plus élevé aurait pu être appréciable). L’arrière-bouche est en deux temps, un fraîche amertume en premier laissant place à plus de douceur. Joli final long sur une dominante chocolat, pruneau et caramel. Cette bière est digne des trappistes. J'attends un potentiel grand frère à 10 % avec grande impatience.\n",
      "Bottle, poured dark with tan head.  With aroma on the coconut and cinnamon. Taste pecan and coconut. After taste picks up the coconut. Over all good beer, gotta try.\n",
      "The beer was purchased in a four pack of 12 oz bottles. Dark brown body had ruby highlights when held up against light. The head was brown, and one finger thick. The beer was lightly carbonated, and the head disappeared shortly after pouring. The aroma was rich, with coffee beans, toffee, and chocolate being the predominant smells. The taste had an incredible depth to it, as the flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and caramel were in perfect harmony. The alcohol content was generously warm. This was definitely a slow sipper, as the sweet aftertaste lingered on and on after swallowing. The body was thick, rich, and coated every corner of the mouth. So glad to have finally found it on the shelves locally. The cost is pretty high at around $24 a four pack, but when you want the best, you have to pay.\n",
      "Heavy clove with effervescent pops of fruit. This is one of my favorite fall drinks.\n",
      "Bottle from release party. Pours burgundy with light head. Aromas of chocolate and berries. Taste is purely chocolate and berries, very tasty.\n",
      "355 ml bottle served in a snifter. Poured dark reddish Brown with three finger tan head. Minimum carbonation. Aroma: bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, toffee, dark fruit, vanilla. Taste: lotsa deep roasted espresso beans upfront with bourbon and oak, dark bitter chocolate, caramel, toffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, nougat, roasted chestnuts, raisins, sultana, plums, dates, Werther's Original. Medium to full body with a roasted bittersweet finish. Lots of coffee and bourbon in this magnificent brew! An absolute delight.\n",

      "Brilliant intense aroma of coffee, cocoa & chocolate. Black with a long lasting brown head. Perfectly balanced medium sweet taste with a touch of dryness. Medium bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation & a finish that just keep on going and going and going. For sure the best beer i've tasted in 2019.\n",

La seconde bouche monte d’un cran en intensité, chocolat très fort, café en grain, boisé / grillé, ambiance de saveurs puissantes dans une certaine douceur, corps huileux tapissant la bouche et bel équilibre  avec l’alcool présent très bien dosé. Décelable dès l’attaque, le piment se fait très présent en milieu de bouche, simple saveur au début, devient piquant en approchant la fin de bouche. Offrant un final entre douceur, piquant et épicé avec une longue persistance chocolat, café, piment, …\n",
      "Avis : Un Imperial Stout suédois en collaboration entre Omnipollo et Wakefield's. D’une richesse incroyable, le piment offre une vraie particularité. La richesse et la puissante masque peut-être la vanille qui se fait assez discrète.\n",

      "I thought this was fantastic. Favorite beer from these guys so far.  Looks great, nice hop flavor, some citrus. Really good.\n",
      "This was delicious. The chocolate is great, the honey isn't too sweet.  These honey dip stouts are just great stuff.\n",
      "2018 batch. Black pour, bourbon nose. Thick, sweet and boozy, wow; this is by far the best BA stout I’ve had!\n",
      "Can from Noble Hops Aberdeen. Pineapple juice levels of murk. Superb. So is the nose. Peachy pulpy stone fruit, a dry savory leaf and a yogurt softness. It all blends together beautifully. A tang of gooseberry and pineapple cuts through all the yellow fruity smoothness. Soft and silky full body with a gentle prickly carbonation. Warm leaf bitterness adds a moderately dry finish. It's full of elements that could have overwhelmed the others but it's masterfully balanced so it doesn't happen. This is delicious. Simple as.\n",
      "Can from the brewery. Real great of aroma of Knob Creek, burnt malt, chocolate. Flavor is just as decadent as the aroma. Knob Creek is very obvious in the mouth. Full mouthfeel, slick texture, and a mild warming after the sip. \n",

      "Buena intensidad en nariz con notas de café con leche, toffee y castañas. En boca es intensa y delicada al tiempo, muy expresiva, saliendo con decisión el café y el toffee. Amargo marcado pero no agresivo ni astringente y muy bien equilibrado. Final amargo largo y sabroso. Gana al atemperarse. Cuerpo medio.\n",

      "Perfect, familiar taste, familiar aroma, familiar aftertastes. I couldn’t ask more. It’s the beer I would like to drink everyday.\n",
      "Bottle. Poured a deep purple color with no head. Another Pips' home run ... wow. Raspberries, honey sticky sweetness, vanilla beans, some of the cacoa comes out and barrel on top of it. Like all Pips, just like they describe it ...and better.\n",
      "Deep dark amberish brownish hue with no head. Lovely subtle nose that’s fruity and gently plummy and fruity and gently sour. Smooth lovely flavor that’s woody and fruity plummy and dark and complex. Lots of dark fruity sourness.\n",
      "1 pint can served in snifter. Poured black with two finger tan head. Aroma: bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, red fruit, Christmas pudding, caramel, roasted nuts, toasted coconut, raisins. Taste: Big roasted sweet malts, big bourbon, toasted oak, dark bitter chocolate, vanilla, roasted nuts, molasses, muscovado sugar, caramel, toffee, almonds, soy sauce, chocolate sauce, sultana, dates, plums, christmas pudding, Graham crackers, nougat, the coconut is in there but very subtly. Very syrupy and chewy mouthfeel. Full body. Big roasted and chocolatey bittersweet finish. This is truly a delightful pastry stout. Very sweet but I'm a sweettooth so this is just porno in a glass for me.\n",

      "Bouteille datant de novembre 2017 bue 2 ans après son embouteillage. Difficile de dire si c’est due à son vieillissement ou bien au lactose, mais l’amertume est moins présente, laissant un goût plus sucrée que la version originale. Le lactose amène du collant aux lèvres, et une touche de sucre sans trop. C’est bien fait.\n",
      "Black pour with a thin foamy light beige head. Big aroma of woody oak and chocolate and coffee and roast barley and more cold brew coffee. Smooth flavor that’s roasty and lightly cocoa’d and loaded with coffee and more woody spirit tones but not too thick and spirited or sugary or boozy. Though there is a bit of dark malty boozy rummy warmth it’s not overpowering, with a big cold brew coffee punch to balance it out.\n",
      "Can.  One of my new faves!  Well finished, smooth, and strong double IPA.  Sweet, with a prominent hoppy nose; 60/40 mixed hop/malt flavors.  No off-flavors.  Delicious, and still very drinkable, despite high 8.5% ABV.\n",

Sweet chocolate, roast malt, woody hops, earthy, nutty and coffee notes flow over the tongue, leaving a roast malt and chocolate finish. Texture offers firm body and lively, lasting fizz. Up with this one!\n",

      "Cool can. Skullkill The Bloodbringer is a Berliner Weiss with raspberry, lemongrass and vanilla added. Pours deeply cloudy purple with a frothy pink head. Plenty of retention. Delicious fresh raspberry nose, and oodles of fresh fruit flavor. A bit of vanilla sneaks in on the tail. Tart in a really good way, like fresh picked berries. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a long juicy finish. Not sugary at all beyond that you'd get eating a fresh raspberry. Simple the best Berliner I've had to this point. Pinky out. Skinny jeans on. Neckbeard unkempt. Don't care, because this beer is THAT good. Nice job, Bhramari.\n",

      "Bottle at home. Pitch black, creamy beige head. Intense roasted malty chocolate, boozy bourbon, toffee, vanilla, molasses, as it warms it gets some light portorized vinous red fruits. Nice chocolate boozy linger. Big body, soft but lively carbonation, sticky mouthfeel.\n",
      "Can at home bought from cloudwater website. This beer had a haze to it which was not expected. This is the best gose I've ever had and it was refreshing and fruity. Damn its good\n",
      "can at home. The beer poured hazy and thick. This is yet another great neon raptor beer.It was hoppy and fruity. This everything I expect to get from a NEIPA\n",
      "İçimi kolay ve zengin aromalı güzel bir İngiliz Ipa birası. Fıcı ve şişe seçimiyle İstanbulda görmek keyif verici.\n",
      "Stout bira severler için özellikle fıcı alternatifi ile İstanbullulara keyif veren güzel İngiliz birası tavsiye ederim..\n",

      "Gerçekten beğendiğim en güzel bitter biralardan özellikle İstanbul’da bulabileceğiniz nadir İngiliz birası afiyetler olsun...\n",
      "Unbelievable.  Unpasteurized sake listed as Mama on the bottle.  Daknole has it right with the details... Honeydew and muskmelon, vanilla, edible flowers like orchids.  This is quite a delight.  Sought this out, as we want to try all the American made sake.  Glad we did, despite the $28/375 price.  Picked up at Vino Di Sedona.\n",
      "The Aromas are Citrus hops and pale malt. Flavors are similar to nose, get more interesting with some peaches, sweetness that is very nicely balanced with great carbonation and rounding out with a full body and excellent finish. Very good beer.\n",
      "Obtained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.00, Pecan Pie Porter is an American Imperial Porter crafted by Clown Shoes Beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields chocolate, espresso, and lactose upon the nose. The appearance is black that pours a low beige head. When light reflects off of the beer, a dark mahogany hue shows. The alcohol content is 8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is soft and rich to the complexion. Lactose smoothens the take and creams the comprehension. Caramel fairly thickens the composition and glistens the lactose mouthfeel. Espresso flavors the chocolate and lactose body and slightly bitters the take. Pecan laces and accents the chocolate and espresso frame. Cinnamon is sensible with the espresso and pecan notes. Honey malt sweetens the beer and tangible with the caramel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pecan Pie Porter is a delectable American Imperial Porter. The chocolate, lactose, caramel, espresso, and pecan combine into an incredibly delicious beer. The lactose makes the beer incredibly light and tones the chocolate profile. The caramel and honey malt combination comes across syrupy. Pecan is prominent from the start into the malty finish. I loved drinking Pecan Pie Porter and discovered an alluring craft beer. This is really good and offers an immersive complexity to the drink.\n",

      "Pours a dark brown with a creamy, silky tan foam head. Aroma is rich chocolate and vanilla. Flavor is sweet, rich chocolate milkshake. Smooth and creamy from the nitro. This is awesome!\n",
      "Phenomenal beer, purchased online from the SAQ, the Brett and oak aging neutralize each other to make such a sweet and complex beer that is why one drinks beer. Kudos!\n",
      "Well hey hey (we're the Monkish), I'm the first to tick this on here, and that's something to be proud of because it was EPPPIIIIIIICCK!!! This is going to be one of my highest rated beers in the last few years. The appearance is great, dark chestnut with a lasting beige head. Aroma is amazing, toffee, honeysuckle (a rare flavor note but definitely there), dates, figs, bourbon, vanilla. The flavor is also awesome, medium sweet but not overly so, no BS American-style hopping, smooth floral honeysuckle and cakey dark fruit, and don't forget the bourbs. Medium-plus body but insanely drinkable for what it is. I recall few beers that caused the #BiLgasm this did. Yes, barleywine, you are life. Thank you for reminding me.\n",

      "\n",
      "Seasonal Wildflower Wit is back! A follow-up to the Elderflower Wit in the springtime, the brewer will continue to release this style each season, combining local & wildcrafted ingredients to subtly enhance a classic style.  Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village of Hoegaarden, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. Inspired by their creation, our brewer freshly foraged sumac to put into the kettle, alongside lemondrop hops, and dried lemon peels.\n",

      "Passar bra till mat eller bara att sitta och ta några med polarna\n",
      "Aromat jest intensywny, a dominują słodkie pomarańcze, kandyzowana skórka pomarańczy i wanilia. Gdzieś w tle doszukać się można zestowej świeżości cytrusów.\n",
      "W smaku jest nieco inaczej. Słodycz nie jest tak ewidentna, a słodziutka, galaretkowa pomarańcza dzieli miejsce z bardziej standardowymi cytrusami, chmielowego pochodzenia. Wanilia podbija wrażenie deseru. Goryczka jest średnio-wysoka, bardzo grejpfrutowa i przyjemna. Alkohol kompletnie niewyczuwalny.\n",
      "Hazy. Golden color. Good lacing. Great all around beer that meets most palates from light to dark. This is a great flagship beer from Nocterra.\n",
      "Butelka 0,355 litra, zakupiona w Kraftstore w Katowicach. Barwa czarna, z minimalnymi rubinowymi prześwitami. Niska, beżowa piana, która szybko opada do małej obrączki. Aromat subtelny, co nie znaczy, że mało wyraźny. Głównie czekolada, rodzynki, wanilia. Beczka raczej umiarkowana. W smaku gorzka czekolada, lekko kwaśna kawa, paloność, lekki tytoń. Alkohol kompletnie ukryty, ale z każdym łykiem coraz bardziej rozgrzewające.\n",
      "I love this beer. It's my favorite mass produced one by far. Very light but with intense flavor and aroma\n",
      "My favorite been has always been Amber Bock , but Ultra Amber is a healthier choice.    Just wish I could find in in cans, as I don't like having glass around the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great smooth flavor.\n",
      "This beer gave me a large boner. It’s aroma holds this little bit of boxed fruit punch from the 90’s. Five alive or minute made, you remember. Taste was citrus and impactful for a low abv offering. Mouthfeel was decadent. \n",

      "Avslutande burk på provning i uterummet med P.N. Doftar söt godis kan vara röda ferarribilar med vanilj. Smaken hög sötma med vanilj choklad o katrinplommon. Ligger som en vägg av smaker. Om ni någonsin ska ha en go avslutande imp.stout. Här är den!!\n",
      "Smakerna krämig med en långa intressanta smakerna där jag får leta efter vad det smakar. Intressant o spännande öl o framförallt god.\n",
      "Oj oj oj oj Såååå god. Smakar tung choklad , Vanilj och svagt mint. SUPERGOD\n",

      "The tastiest gose I've had in a long time, and one my new favourites in general! It's the right amount of fruity and salty, not very sour. Loved it!\n",
      "Sampled at All In Beer Fest 2019. Clear ruby, pink head. Tropical fruits in perfect harmony with red berries. Medium to full bodied. Dry, medium to high acidity. Fantastic!\n",
      "If there's a perfect \"normal\" type stout, this is it.  No gimmicks, not imperial, not barrel-aged, just a medium-to-full palate, earthy, dark chocolate, roasty, smooth, hint-of-vanilla-and-coffee stout.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Can from the Olney, MD Safeway.\n",
      "Woah. No wonder this won some contest. All the things the label says are here. It really comes together. Stupid high score on appearance and lacing. Stone doesn't go light in their descriptions but was not expecting all of this going on.\n",
      "Bright gold with a sudsy white head. Aroma of scotch bonnet and tangerine peels which is almost certainly Armarillo hops. Hint of spice drop and Christmas gummies. Juicy and sweet, without any clumpy yeast or protein sediment.  The heavy minerality is a little bit detracting.  Bitterness is mellow and soft, and the balance is great.\n",
      "Fles 33cl thuis. Vol en romig, salmiak tonen, koffie, roasted malts, wat lactose en vanille, caramel, flink droog, donkere chocolade, kleine fizz, wat donker fruit. Goede balans. Lekker. (3-11-2019).\n",
      "Can, picked up at the brewery. Hazed, medium orange gold. Thin and dense, fully lacing, lasting, white head. Nose has a rich, jammy citrus character. Some menthol like pine. Super clean malts. Notes of fresh tea leaf. The hops have been thoroughly wrung out here. Smells great. Taste has clean, pithy, citrus bitterness. Flicker of candied peel sweetness. Medium body. Silky smooth. Fine carbonation. Lingering citrus bitterness to finish. Incredibly easy drinking IPA, with beautiful balance throughout.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from Ridgewood Wine & Beer (Raleigh, NC).  Cola-like brown pour with a short khaki head.  Aroma of bourbon and rum with some noted graham cracker.  The taste is incredible and complex with chocolate, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, and caramel (and not necessarily in that order).  Each sip is a new adventure with different flavors coming to the forefront.  The finish is somewhat warm but welcome.  A truly stunning beer and one of the best I can remember trying in quite some time.\n",
      "Amertume sèche intense. Reste en bouche. Notes plus maltées que la Focal ou Heady.\n",
      "...........................................................................wow\n",
      "Club bottle. Black pour, cocoa head, some coconut floaties. Big fudgy aroma, some booze and barrel, coffee and vanilla, coconut. Sweet, roasty, very tasty. This beer is the very definition of decadent. Shows a bit of heat or I'd have scored it even higher.\n",
      "This is one of my favoites. Rich vanilla goodness. One of my favorite things about winter. Great on tap or the bottle.\n",
      "Tap at Modern Times.  Black with cocoa head.  Amazing nose of coffee and chicory, barrel and almonds.  Flavor is light roast, lots of adjuncts, a little sweet but smooth and not overpowering.  I slightly prefer the non-mega version to this, but it's a damn good sipper!\n",
      "Can even better!  Gotta up this high 4.4 to a 4.5.  Without the heat this would be damn near perfect.\n",
      "A very good brown ale. A somewhat sweet taste. A good caramel taste. Great on tap, good out of the bottle. Maybe it is the best brown ale?\n",

      "12oz can. Beautiful tropical nose. Tons of pineapple up front, mango, papaya, melon, orange/tangerine, bits of dankness, a touch of resin, grapefruit, clean biscuity malt, fresh grain, very light minerality, and of course that HF ale yeast. Taste is smooth af, fruity, subtly juicy, with lots of melon on the second half. Velvet texture as usual, no rough edges, with subtle resinous bitterness on the finish. I love this as much as the Double Galaxy. So fucking good.\n",
      "Fantastic mouthfeel and taste. Doesn’t drop out all bittering and the citrus flavor is abundant. The nose is pithy and the taste is oj.\n",
      "Une merveille rafraîchissante. On sent bien l'orange, le citron et le houblon. Super mousse en bouche.   Love it!   😍 🍻\n",

      "Voilà la bière belge comme je l’aime ! Distinguée, racée, à la fois tempétueuse tout en restant sur la réserve, chaleureuse sans en faire de trop. On retrouve très clairement la patte De Dolle dans cette Lichtervelds Blond. Nous sommes également à la fois dans l'esprit et dans la réalisation proche d'une moinette blonde. Beau visuel en verre, avec un blond doré quasi limpide, de très nombreuses et fines bulles ainsi qu'une mousse blanche crémeuse abondante (3 cm). Très joli nez sur les fruits jaunes, les céréales, la levure, la coriandre et un alcool donnant un bon pep's.  Superbe attaque parfaitement équilibrée, avec un alcool soutenant bien les aromes, sans dénoter toutefois, ni être agressif, et avec une pointe d'acidité citronnée conférant un peu de fraîcheur. On y retrouve le cocktail découvert au nez. C'est à la fois ample et pêchu. La deuxième bouche est plus intense avec un alcool qui y est un peu plus chaleureux tout en restant bien intégré. Deux légers petits bémols lui font perdre le coup de cœur. Un petit poivre légèrement trop présent allié à une petite aigreur en arrière-bouche. Joli final, long, stable et ne perdant pas en arômes. Bonne corpulence également (sans être incroyable). Très belle symphonie.\n",

      "Color marrón muy oscuro, casi negro, opaca. Dos dedos de espuma beige con excelente retención. Aroma a chocolate negro, café, ligera ceniza y notas herbales. Gusto a chocolate negro, café, nata, caramelo, malta tostada, final de trago dulce y herbal. Cuerpo semioleoso. Porter compleja y muy matizada, me parece una auténtica pasada de birra y con un precio excelente.\n",
      "Another great beer by this brewer. This one is crisp with the perfect balance of hops. The initial pallet is delightful, and the after taste seems to keep surprising with amazingly balanced flavors. It’s hard to put this beer down. It is a bit pricey, and also pretty strong, but that comes with imperials like this that seem to keep better than lower % brews. Most definitely it is worth the price.\n",
      "Stone Brewing’s Xocoveza 8.1% ABV. This Stout pours a deep dark brown almost black color with a one finger width mocha tan colored head that dissipates slowly leaving some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted coffee and chilies along with dark roasted malts cinnamon vanilla all capped off with a enticing aroma of chocolate and cocoa nibs. The flavor is very cinnamon forward along with the chocolate and coffee with accents of chili peppers vanilla cloves and nutmeg there’s a slight toasted earthy almost smoky flavor from the peppers. The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly viscous but yet not as heavy as an imperial stout the carbonation level is about right and the alcohol content isn’t detectable. Overall this is an absolutely amazing delicious stout that I look forward to every year. 9.5/10\n",
      "A very smooth tasting beer . Beautiful color . Second year having it . Most of the time I've had it on draft at a local establisment . Went through a local drive through and saw they had 12 packs of it . It was in cans , so i was skeptical , got it and brought it home . Poured 2 cans in a large glass , and i wasnt disappointed . Tastes the same as draft . Sam Adams never seems to disappoint .\n",
      "Pours a jet black with a tan foam head. Aroma is cinnamon, coffee, roast, vanilla, and chocolate. Flavor is sweet vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and roast. Smooth. Man this is good.\n",
      "Really good, balanced and not overpowering Aromas of fresh coffee, roast, cocoa, dark malt and a little mineral. Flavors are very much like nose, a little more sweet than bitter in the bitter coming from the malts and not So Much from the Hops. Excellent carbonation and Body, ditto the Finish. Just really nice beer.\n",

      "This beer was purchased at the brewery on 8/28/19. Jen Kimmich told me it was packaged on 8/26/19. Staying the night in Stowe, the Best Western Hotel stored the 4.5 cases (Don't ask what I spent. I have an understanding wife who does not drink any alcoholic beverage.) in their food refrigerator. Mary, the manager, understood that The Alchemist beers need to be stored cold. Reminds me of what Coors did before going national. Many thanks to Mary and a desk clerk whose name escapes me.\n",

      "The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a dense white head that remains thick and laces.The nose is tropical fruit with a little grapefruit and with slight piney resin. Body is light medium. Mouthfeel is well rounded with no crisp notes. Taste is tropical fruit, smooth malt structure with a hint of sweetness with light bitterness in the aftertaste. It has a great balance in common with Heady Topper. Using a word from another of their beers, it is Luscious as the little brother to Heady Topper.  Drinking fresh makes a difference. 16 oz can\n",

      "Founders CBS has a medium, beige-to-tan head, a very dark brown (nearly black) appearance, and some glass lacing. The aroma is of rich chocolate, coffee, malt, and sugar. The flavor is similar, with fairly low bitterness. I did not pick up specific maple nor bourbon. Mouthfeel is heavy, and Founders CBS 2019 finishes sweet. RJT\n",
      "I saw the Coors Non-Alcoholic at a Neighborhood Wal-Mart in McKinney, Texas. I love Coors and decided to try this 0.5% brew. The first bottle made me a believer. It has a full-bodied, crisp taste and no after taste like some other non-alcoholic beers I have tried. AND, it has only 58 calories. If you like Coors, you will like this.\n",

      ". Crushing. Lots and lots of bitterness and juicy resiny piney hops character. In your face, intense, well attenuated, carbonated too. Easy drinking, booze hidden. Great beer!\n",
      "Nose is fruity and a little dank with lots of citrus.  Flavor leans hard on hops without a lot of bitterness;  malt balance against juicy hop flavor dominates the palate. Finish is medium and slightly acidic. Great!\n",
      "I disobeyed the directive and poured into a glass - hazy gold with a thick almost white head with good retention and gobs of sticky lacing.  Orange and lemon citrus but also mango and pineapple.  Grassy and piney hops, bread, touch of caramel and earth.  Medium carb, medium+ body, soft texture.  The finish gradually becomes more bitter as it fades.  Based on reputation I was expecting this to be more assertive, but the show here is the delicious balance.\n",
      "32oz crowler pours with a clear deep gold to copper body that supports a thin off white head of foam. The aroma offers up pineapple, grapefruit, mango and tangelo. The taste delivers a smooth juicy blend of tangelo, mango, grapefruit and a bit of some tangy tangerine. Yes. This creates a pleasant play between citrus juiciness, tropical juiciness and citrus bitterness. Wow. Off in the background are murmurs of berry and lime giving this a little more depth and contrast. \n",

      "Cloudy golden with a thick foamy white head. Really delightful aroma that’s pale malty and wheaty fluffy with nice tropical grassy fruity tones with light floral resins and tones of earthy citrus. Smooth flavor that’s juicy and fruity and tropical with notes of grains of paradise and citrus and a kiss of white pepper. Lovely and complex and tropical and actually gently dry and balanced.\n",
      "Tap at MT PDX.  Black with tan head, this beer is luxurious on every level.  I was apprehensive about this but it ended up the #1 beer of a very beer heavy trip, and top 5 or so on the year for me.  Decadent waves of complex coconut, roasted malt, chocolate.  Not overly sweet though big bodied it never shows 14.4%.  Awesome!  Low 4.6.\n",

      "Underappreciated beer here!  This pinkish purple elixr was maaaybe my favorite (probably second, of many) of an epic 4 day Oregon Bender.  Maple up front and center but somehow not overdone as it's cut by loads of tart jammy blueberry, ample roasted and slightly bitter coffee and even some lactose to make this \"mindfuck\" of a beer (as our bartender aptly called it) even more ridiculously awesome.\n",

      "Slightly hazy bright golden with a thick foamy sticky white head. Lovely nose that’s fruity and juicy and lightly resinous with pine and pineapple and citrus fruit. Smooth flavor that’s soft and wheaty and pale and lightly fluffy with a lovely tree fruity tropical juicy hop flavor featuring papaya and pineapple and mango and a touch of citrus and tangerine and a smooth lingering fresh hoppy leafy resinous finish. Really charming and great!\n",

      "My first beer review in over 2 years, felt like this was so good I had to.  Gifted a bottle from a friend in Milwaukee and enjoyed in Savannah, GA.  Pitch black with tan head, aroma is very strong in maple syrup, chocolate, light coconut, tingle of molasses.  Taste is like French toast with espresso nicely balanced and it’s incredible.  Definitely one of the best beers I’ve ever had.\n",
      "Draft at brewery. Pours yellow and thick with a white head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Big mango and vanilla and peach on the nose and tongue. Good tartness as well. Super crushable.\n",
      "Bottle.  Pours clear golden,  small kinda fizzy white head,  dissipates with a hint of lacing. Aroma is pungent, musty,  brett, basement,  earth,  bright citrus,  lemon,  horse blanket,  citron. Flavor is light tart,  medium funk,  lovely contrast of Brett funk and Amarillo hop.  Light body,  soft carbonation.  Lovely. All of you dumbasses who raked this two years ago should have rotted it to bring out the yeast character.\n",
      "Jeez Louize, knock my socks off with this aromatherapy. Hop Butcher seduces you with its aroma of love. This is a lovely blend of mosaic and citra hops and  hazy as a daisy (it rhymed). It's simply lovely.\n",
      "Black pour with a thick creamy light tan head.    Lovely nose of creamy milk chocolate and marshmallow cream and a hint of vanilla. Smooth dark creamy chocolatey flavor loaded with lactose and a touch of vanilla, marshmallow, and sweet chocolate. Lovely and full, just the right amount of roasty bitterness.\n",

      "Right up there with the more expensive Southern Tier Imperial Stoudts!\n",
      "Poured from 500ml bottle into pint glass. A thin tan, sudsy head drops quickly with mild lacing. Color is opaque brown. Aroma of rich roasted malt, chocolate, nuts, citrus rind. Mouthfeel thick and creamy with a long slowly drying finish. Flavors of dark roasted malt, slight char, cream, chocolate, cocoa powder, nuts, earthy and citrus hops. Overall: outstanding.\n",
      "Clear bright golden with a thin white sticky head. Lovely pale biscuity golden nose with lovely sticky piney resins, super aromatic and fresh. Smooth brisk flavor that’s pale and a little grainy with nice grassy floral grassy resins. Low bitterness but high hop flavor.\n",
      "Acheté à La Barik à Trois-Rivières. Il s’agit de ma première note parfaite pour ma deuxième bière préféré jusqu’à présent! D’un noir très profond avec une sublime mousse caramel, cette bière dégage de magnifiques odeur boisé et alcoolisé. En bouche, des saveurs de chocolat noir se bousculent avec des saveurs de Bourbon et de Brandy qui se termine sur une finale juste assez amer qui tend très légèrement vers le café. Une merveille en bouteille, rien de moins! Merci au Trois-Mousquetaire pour cette expérience sublime.\n",
      "Bottle at home. Very cloudy mahogany, thick pour, no head. Nose is nicely sweet, coffee, toffee, dried fruits, coconut, bourbon boozy undertone. Taste is really good too, lots of mellow coffee, praline, cacao, vanilla, fudge, boozy bourbon, dried fruits, light porto-ish, light coconut. Great balance. Nicely lingering coffee chocolate light bourbon. Big body, thick and sticky mouthfeel, low carbonation.\n",

      "Opaque black beer with a slight/medium brown/dark brown head. Heavy aroma; taste starts heavy sweet and ends slightly bitter and dry. Wood, vanilla, cream, chocolate, mocha and roasted malts. 9/5/9/4\n",

      "Hazy golden body with a big foamy and persistent white head. Aroma is floreal and grassy. Taste is crispy and hoppy at the same time: camomile, mild honey notes, grassy hops. Grassy and floreal finish. Medium body, soft natural carbonation, oily texture.\n",
      "Bottle. Poured a deep purple with no head. These Pancake beers are all fantastic .. all for different reasons. This one did not disappoint. Fruity, berries, pancakes, honey, sticky, and vanilla. Just wow ...\n",
      "Straw-Ber-Rita has no foam nor lacing, but it does have lots of bubbles and a semi-clear red color. The aroma is of strawberry drink, and the flavor is of that, too, with some pale malt & tartness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Straw-Ber-Rita finishes drying, in that high-fructose corn syrup fashion. RJT\n",
      "rich golden colour, well carbonated, fruity, juicy, hoppy, grapes, kiwi, citrus, gooseberry, woody, oak, dry, slightly acidic, refreshing. Brut IPA barrel aged - can it get any better?\n",

      "amber with red hues. refreshingly acidic, vineous, oak, fruity, red berries, dry. easy drinking yet complex\n",
      "pitch black, solid beige head. coconut, vanilla, coffee. smooth, silky, warming. can't get enough of it\n",
      "I love their single hop series. Chinook comes with distinct citrus/ grapefruit. could be more bitter though\n",
      "probably the best n/a beer I ever head. tastes much better than quite some IPAs with alcohol!\n",
      "Stillwater Artisanal Ales Inspired By A Fancy Chocolate Bar 10% ABV. This Imperial Stout pours a deep dark brown color almost black with a one finger width tan colored head that dissipates rather quickly without leaving a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of a combination of milk and dark chocolate with hints of cocoa powder coffee brown sugar molasses toffee vanilla sweet cream with a toasted nut and bread background with lighter notes of figs raisins plums and dates along with cherry and earthy notes. The flavor is very rich and chocolatey with the combination of milk and dark chocolate flavors coming out along with the cocoa powder coffee vanilla molasses and caramel brown sugar honey with cream toasted nuts and bread with hints of the dates figs raisins plums and cherries adding depth and richness it finishes with lingering flavors of chocolate with a pleasant hop bitterness to counteract all the sweetness. The mouthfeel is very thick and creamy almost syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation it finishes with a dryness from the alcohol content. 9.5/10\n",
      "Beautiful Impy. Huge bourbon character, touch of sweetness (since it's an RIS), beautifully balanced. Underneath the bourbon is chocolate, coffee, caramel, liqourice and dark roasted malt. Very rich and full of flavour. If only I had another bottle!\n",
      "Great mango guava aroma and flavor. Lactic sour balances really well but it is super fruity like a slushy. Smooth super balanced fruity sour. Really like this. So tropical and delicious, so much fruit, but the sour is enough to balance the massive amount of fruit. Many, guava and passion fruit is a great fruit combo as well.  Unique delicious well made beer.\n",
      "Tasted from bottle aged 5 years. Pours black with beige head. Aroma is incredible with vanilla mixed with bourbon notes. Molasses and caramel notes.  Flavors of strong vanilla along with caramel, brown sugar. Hides ABV ridiculously well. Awesome BCS variant but I’d like the vanilla component to be a little more subtle letting the bourbon and stout flavors come through more.\n",
      "Beautiful Imperial Stout. Flavour is huge in chocolate, coffee, vanilla, spices, cinnamon, slight chilli and a huge backbone of dark roasted malt. As it warmed up, the flavour profile opened up even more to some caramel and other awesome flavours. Sad to see the bottle finish\n",
      "Clear rich golden, slightly copper, thin sticky white head. Lovely nose of gently fruity Lagery copper toasty malts that remind me of a light Belgian amber—but in a lovely way that’s not an off flavor. Smooth Lagery flavor that’s copper malty and very slightly toasty with gentle hints of toasted biscuit and a clean delightful finish.\n",

      "Anchorage Brewing Company’s Patterns Quadruple IPA 11.5% ABV. This Quadruple IPA pours a deep dark golden orange color with a orange tinted colored one finger width head that lingers for a while before leaving some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of fresh citrus like oranges mangoes peaches grapefruits pineapples with a hint of pine all wrapped in a malty sweetness. The flavor is very similar to the aroma with the citrus shining through in the way of the oranges peaches pineapples mangoes and a heavy dose of grapefruit with a malty sweetness that adds depth there’s also a slight hint of pine before finishing with a refreshing hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is syrupy and mouth coating without a ton of carbonation it finishes drying on the palate from the high alcohol content. 8.5/10\n",
      "Garrison has been around for a long time and beats the new trendy brands at there own game.\n",
      "Can from The Experiment. Familiar yellow orange murk with a thin white head. Aroma is sweet lemon sherbert, orange candy, unripe mango, balanced against savoury spring onion, coriander and dank hops. Body is massive, medium carbonation, with a very smooth, slick mouthfeel as its goes down. Taste is a battle between sweet and herbacious/savoury. Lemon, orange, mango, coriander versus pine and liquorice, some coconut cream from the Sabro with a tingling faint bitterness. Reminds me of a Thai green papaya salad, or maybe I'm just hungry?! Complex and moreish, this is perfection in a glass as far as I'm concerned.\n",
      "Love this beer, not overly hoppy or grapefruity like a lot of of IPAs out there. A tad on the sweet side but not way to sweet. Great summer IPA but if they keep makin it I’ll drink it year round!\n",

Entrée en bouche douce, subtile mais avec beaucoup de \"présence\". Ensuite la bouche est bien ronde, légèrement piquante, alcoolisée et chaleureuse avec une petite à moyenne carbonatation. Des goûts de vanille, de chocolat au lait, de malts, de fruits noirs, de café, de fruits secs ... toute la panoplie. Bière équilibrée et complexe, épicée mais pas trop -comme je les aime- et pourtant bien dans la tradition des Imperial!\n",

Aroma of rich roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, dark fruit, floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a somewhat drying finish. Flavors dominated by dark roasted malt, well toasted bread, cocoa, plums, pear, earthy and floral hops. Overall: a very interesting and complex brew.\n",
      "Still to this day this is by far one of my favorites to have. I opened a 2007 bottle and poured in to the glass with no head. The aroma was bourbon and chocolate. The The beer still had carbonation after all of these years and had a strong taste of bourbon.\n",

      "Aromat intensywny, kawa i kakao grają tu główne rolę, delikatnie laktoza w tle.\n",
      "W smaku sztos, kakao, mleczna czekolada, delikatnie kawa, wanilia, alkohol niewyczuwalny.\n",
      "Często mam tak przy piwach że aromat jest świetny, a w smaku jest przeciętniak. Tutaj było odwrotnie, niezły aromat i sztos w smaku, gęste, intensywny, naprawdę świetne piwo, a Browar York to był zdecydowanie czarny koń WFP.\n",
      "500-ml bottle from lincoln park food & liquor. gorgeous cascading head that fizzed away vigorously and almost completely, huge chocolate nose, boozy, huge chocolate / fudge, full body, decadent, the most and best chocolate ever.\n",
      "It pours clear, golden with a full white head. Head retention is excellent. It has a strong grapefruit citrus aroma. There is a bit of pine with bread in the background. It has a strong grapefruit flavor with some citrus elements. There are some light stone fruit notes in the background. There is also a low bready and biscuity quality as well. It has a medium body with strong bitterness. Overall, excellent IPA with strong grapefruit and a surprisingly stone fruit and biscuit quality that comes on strong through the finish.\n",
      "bitter, bread, high drinkability, smooth, clean crisp, fruity, salty, umami, nice white foam, good golden color,\n",

      "looks like raspberry juice. Smells like rose and Cabernet with apple. Lambic-like. Ultra dry. Sour and lots of apple and pear\n",
      "Excellent ipa. Good body and mouthfeel, good balance of bitterness, hops and sweetness.\n",
      "This was the first beir I drank in Germany and truly loved. The banana flavor is awesome and it's well balanced. This is the beir that helped me to start expanding my horizons when enjoying a beir.\n",
      "At Borefts 2019. Aroma of bourbon vanilla, chocolate, caramel fudge and malt. Taste has rich caramel fudge, cinnamon, vanilla, bourbon booze, chocolate and soft chili. All the flavors are strong, but very balanced. This is amazing.\n",
      "Замечательный марцен.Вкус изящный,немного медовый.Очень люблю октоберфестовские сорта,этот из лучших.Avra greek restaurant Bangkok\n",
      "Один из лучших на мой вкус нейпа,совершенно не горький,фруктовый.В Авре ресторане Бангкок\n",
      "Шикарное пиво.Если любите Хугарден,то это улучшенная крафтовая версия.Пил в Авра ресторан в Бангкоке.\n",
      "Pours deep coffee just a skeezix above black with a thick and persistent chocolate head. Aroma delivers roast coffee with some green coffee beans, roast malt, milk chocolate, nutty and subtle dark fruit notes. Flavor presents roast malt, quality coffee, chocolate, nutty and, yes, a little cherry on the back end, plus a charred side note. Texture offers good, smooth body and lively fizz. Enjoy any time of night - or day, because it's midnight somewhere on the globe.\n",
      "3grams carbs, 6.9% alcohol, gluten free?  The only downside is the price is about $12 per 6-pack here in Lexington KY.  Very delicious crisp cider that won't make you fat or give you diabetes plus it has a high alcohol content.  There is no aroma of \"rotting fruit\" as one reviewer describes.  If you are following the primal/paleo lifestyle (no gluten, low carbs) this is a godsend.\n",
      "I love a good porter beer. I recently was vacationing at the Grand Canyon and found pie hole on tap. I was instantly amazed with the taste of this beer. It is very smooth and you can independently taste the vanilla, coffee, chocolate with the hint of cherry. After having a couple at the lodge, I found they also sold them in the can at the general store inside Grand Canton national park so I picked up a few for my hotel room. The only bad thing...I am from Texas and it isn’t available here, so I am prepared to vacation more in Arizona just so I can have access to such a great beer!\n",

      "Holy Guacamole this is a damn good beer, it’s just like Ninja vs Unicorn but HAZY!!! So here is my original review for Ninja vs Unicorn, but HAZY. \n",
      "\n",
      "“ Had it out of a bomber, poured a clear (HAZY) yellow color with a thin head and even lacing. The aroma is of sweet hops, tickles the nostrils even, the taste is hoptacular with notes of citrus. I Say yes!”\n",
      "Oily beautiful texture, sweet dark chocolate rounds up the heavy roasted and coffee flavours. Very nice coffee notes without overpowering other flavours.\n",
      "Mang-O-Rita has lots of fizzy bubbles and no foam nor lacing. The appearance is opaque orange. The aroma is of mangoes and pale malt, and the flavor is the same, with a Splenda brand sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Mang-O-Rita finishes (high-fructose corn syrup) drying. It's top-notch, for what it is, but I just don't like what it is. RJT\n",
      "In my opinion there here is nothing (in beer) more beautiful than a proper nitro pour, and this isn't an exception! Black, thick and creamy beige nitro head, with a sticky (Guinness type) of lacing. Chocolate, roasted barley  and coconut to the nose. Moderately sweet and toasty, with cocoa, quality coffee and coconut, very well balanced. Creamy, smooth, slick mouthfeel, long rich finish. Excellent from head to toes.\n",
      "Bottled - 750ml direct from the San Diego Brewery shop. Been waiting a while to try this bad boy. Poured into wide snifter. Like any Speedway variant - this beer is best served around cellar temp at 53-55F. Frothy 2cm burgundy colored head capping off the typical Speedway darkness. The aroma is unreal...soft coffee bean, blueberry muffin, dark chocolate, raisin bread and pancake batter. Damn fine, damn fine. Coffee on the flavor seems restrained compared to stock Speedway, but I’d need a side by side comparison to verify. Great depth with loads of chocolate and roasted malt. Medium to elevated acidity on the finish which does (slightly) negatively impact the palate. Strong bitterness with a lasting cacao musk in the soft palate after each sip. Above all else the aroma here was outstanding. Another little taste of nirvana from the Smithy. Amidst all of the expansion, saturation and loss of rarity in the San Diego craft beer scene in the last 10 years, the Smithy still continues to deliver the greats.\n",
      "Bottle at Discount Liquor in Wendover, NV. Pours a golden amber with a nice white head. Smells of bananas and hops. Flavor is sweet, smooth, a little hops, but with a delightful finish. Great IPA.\n",
      "500mL bottle, pours black with almost no head. Aroma is incredibly complex, with lots of those delicious Pappy barrels upfront, with coconut, vanilla, and coffee. Flavour is along the same lines, with intense Pappy barrels, vanilla, coffee, honey sweetness, and a touch of coconut. Complex as hell, with honey and bourbon barrels dominating the finish. The ABV is surprisingly well-hidden. Beautiful.\n",
      "On tap pour, in Navy Yard, DC, The Big Stick. Pours black with a huge, frothy tan head, lots of lacing. Creamy mouthfeel, coats your tongue with deliciousness. Taste follows the nose, roasty char, dark chocolate, vanilla, a hint of licorice - extremely drinkable. Just a ridiculously good beer.\n",
      "Taps opaque coffee with a nice tan head. Aroma gives rich chocolate, quality coffee, roast malt and toffee notes - has me going Pavlov! Flavor delivers roast malt, milk chocolate, quality coffee, toasted coconut and toffee notes - wow and WOW! Texture presents firm, smooth body and lively fizz. Get caught in this web!\n",
      "Attained at Handy Market from Burbank, California for $16.99, Berlinerish is a Berliner Weisse style ale bottle conditioned with honey brewed by Cellador Ales from Los Angeles, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragrance of apricot, lemon, red wine, and funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a minimal white head. The alcohol content is 4.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apricot is juicy and fairly thickens the body. Lemon tones the drink and sours the take. Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts smoothens the complexion and delivers a soft lactic feel. Red wine glistens the dry, funky finish and grows as the finish drags on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Orange blossom honey flavors the apricot and lemon frame and tasted when you lick your chops. Oats compliments the yeasty and apricot composition. Floor malted wheat textures the lemon, Pilsner malt, and lactic mouthfeel. Oak offers a woodsy tinge to the wine and yeasty characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Berlinerish is a delectable Berliner Weisse. The apricot, lemon, orange blossom honey, Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus yeasts, and oats combine into a one of a kind craft beer. The lactic yeasts sparkle with the lemon and apricot body. Spelt is sensible with the malted wheat, Pilsner malt, and oats. The highlight is the orange blossom honey and red wine blending together in the finish. The sour aspect is easy to experience yet sour enough to please a sour fan. I cherished Berlinerish as each drink brings complexity and depth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",

      "Schlenkerla's entire lineup is exceptional, but Lentbier is the pinnacle of old world German craft. A unfiltered malty masterpiece, the aroma swirls between deep breadiness, caramel malts, fireplace smoke and yeast. The smoke is right there at the front of every quaff, but despite its strength, leaves room for the malty character to take center stage. The clean long smoky semi sweet fade ebbs away allowing just a nip of spicy hops to arrive just in time to lend balance. I find myself wanting to take huge gulps, to fill every corner of my mouth with this mahogany magnificence. Scenes of black forest lumberjacks carving through ancient beech trees in a darkening twilight during the high medieval period are entirely appropriate for this session. This beer takes you on a journey. Amazing.\n",
      "Von Pilsner has a thick, creamy, white head, a hazy, bubbly, golden color, and lots of glass lacing. The aroma is of yeasty biscuit & grassy hop resins, and the flavor is similar, with noticeable & pleasant bitterness. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Von Pilsner finishes medium dry. RJT\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! Bouteille bue 2 1/2 ans après son embouteillage. Un nez incroyable de brett, bananes, sucrée et hoppy. Le gout est extraordinaire, un belle complexité, difficile a décrire, les bretts sont pas trop présente, seulement parfaite. A reessayer!!\n",
      "This was delicious! Fruity and hoppy and very drinkable. Great strength and served about 18c . Will buy again\n",
      "Pours a golden color with a white foam head. Aroma is strawberry and vanilla. Flavor is sweet strawberry, chocolate, roast, and vanilla. Smooth and silky. Excellent.\n",

      "HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.\n",

      "Got this scary can from JRs. Was not looking forward to this tick. After all, it says it has some artificial flavors in it. Pours clear pale from a pounder can.  Smell is somewhat artificial apple, like hardtack candy. Taste is as expected, somewhat rude ass artificial apple candy with a vanilla backbone. Cannot get this. It also has a warming sensation as it goes down the gullet. Can't say I'm disjointed because I didn't expect much. I had high hopes for the Blockhouse brand but I'm afraid they are just turning into another alky laced soda pop brand. This stuff is more on the line of those kindah malt beverages, has little to do with beer, thanks. I'm going to mix the rest of this with a can of IC light to try to straighten it out a bit and make it more acceptable. Whew.\n",

Go figger. Just like any other million IPAs out there except maybe its really hazy. Could not appreciate. Nothing odd about this. It looks OS finally caved to commercialism. This style is so ubiquitous and they all mostly taste the same. I gotta quit buying this happy bullshit style. Its noteven good enough for a tik.\n",

Maybe I can find some hints of guava and passion fruit, but not much. Yes, lots of IPA bitterness, but good co2 for an IPA. Terribly on style, rude crude and nasty. Hey, IPA, I'm calling your name. I need to impeach this style, get it off ratebeer, heheheheh. Call in the witnesses; IPA is ubiquitous,the new cheap macro brew.\n",

The finish is slightly dry and bittersweet with more weak orange squash,grape,burnt rubber & sweaty groin. Can’t believe the charge nearly £8 for this !

      "0,33l Flasche. Trübes Bier. Zitronenlimo Geruch. Wässerig süsser zuckeriger Geschmack. Kaum Bier, vielleicht auch besser so.\n",
      "Drainpour - The taste is of corn malt syrup, rank sugar and a horrible hop blend. They tried too hard to make a beer that is the opposite of a light beer that they went over the deep end and made an undrinkable beer. Syrupy mouthfeel - disgusting aftertaste. This is truly horrible - worst than even the cheapest light beer. Drainpour. Drainpour. Did I mention drainpour?\n",
      "0,5 l Flasche. Goldenes Bier, flacher Schaum. Riecht nach Erbsensuppe, schmeckt laff und langweilig, immerhin besser als der Geruch.\n",

What else can be asked from one of a million ubiquitous, really effin straight up ass, on style  IPA? Go figger. Same as it ever was. Gimmie a smooth clean pale lager for a chaser please. I must say hover, its got some pretty decent co2 to set of the bitter terribleness.\n",

      "Smell of malt with wooden and caramel notes. In taste a disagreeable bitterness covering all the other flavours. Low carbonation.\n",
      "Aroma : Massively overripe super sweet bananas.   Taste : as nose + synthetic chemicals, sweetness completely overpowering, not beer as I know it - revolting - poured 50% away\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours dark yellow with no head to speak of at all. Taste and aroma of sweet corn, malt liquor like. Too sweet just to gain .5 percent of alcohol from the regular doesn't' seem like a good trade off, not that regular is great.\n",
      "Smells bitter, not much carbonation or flavor. Shitty head, nearly no alcohol\n",
      "Draught at BGM 2019. Light hops, lots of green apple notes and astringency. Bad.\n",
      "Fajnie wygląda - mętne, bladozłote, piana dość drobna i ładnie oblepia. Aromat mokrej piwnicy, utleniony, zwietrzałe zioła, lukrowy. Smak owocowy, guma balonowa, cukierki żelki. Dziwnie słodkie i jak napoj gazowany.\n",

      "Tap at bowsers in monaca. I'm so tired of ubiquitous IPA and I'm especially tired of NB revamping the ranger by just slapping a new label on any ubiquitous IPA, quite rude. I'm done ticking these things they always taste the same, my immature taste buds cannot differentiate between these. Anyway, this is just another bitter IPA. Big stupid straight up ass insult to my lager loven taste buds. Whew, rubber chewing on inner tube long bitter finish as well. Just like any other terribly on style IPA, go figger.\n",
      "Tap at bowsers, thot I did this one already. A darker brew. Smells like some kind of sweet cinnamon cookies. Taste is flat and bitter with too much of that holiday spice thing going on, comes across as quite rude on the palate. Not good, just too much spices. Seems more like a medicine. Difficult to finish. Good example of a poorly made holiday brew, whew.\n",
      "Tap at bowsers. Pale  and it has a mild perfume hop nose. Very bitter up front with lots with lots of green grapefruit rind in there. Mellows out just a bit in the middle. Interesting. Not as bad as I thought it would be if that's any consolation.\n",
      "soft foam on a medium clear brown body, heavy ginger and sugar on the nose that's kind of unappetizing. Flavour is rough ginger leaning towards burlap, wool socks. Lingering mouthfeel of more ginger but it's like sucking on those wool socks. I normally lean into ginger beers but this is just too overbearing, more fake than fresh ginger and it's coming off as way too rough.\n",

      "Donkergeel bier met beperkte witte schuimkraag. Aanzet is licht zoet wat vervalt in een wrange zware alcohol smaak\n",
      "Pours headless, malty aroma and grassy spiced fruit finish. Have seen this in a mix pack with midway and other goose island beers, I like their other stuff but this would be a reason for me not to buy the selection pack, it’s very different and far from hoppy like Midway and their ipa.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 09/05/2007.  Crikey, I remember having a bottle of this some years prior, when it still had a peal off top, and don’t remember it being so bad.  This was simply a greAt example of terrible, pasteurised bottled bitter.\n",
      "[email protected], Tampere, Finland. Light/medium, slightly bitter nuances of bitter grains, a hint of German hops and plastic side-note. Narrow taste spectrum and medium/short aftertaste with some grains. Light body with high/medium carbonation. Overall, bulk in all aspects although 5% gives a hint of more structure. 3 2 3 2 5\n",
      "Ultra clear golden and lightly orange coloured body with a faint, sliver of a pale white head that fades immediately upon pouring. Aroma of ultra funky yeasts with some ashtry, a dash of brine, a lot of caster sugar, icing sugar, fake fruits and a big hit of old ladies (think grandmother) perfume - very funky, fragrant and pungent in a bad way. Light-bodied; Sharp fake lime flavous dominate at first with a lot of lactose and creamy notes with a lot of perfume, hay, grass and funky yeast flavours that show through as the old lady perfume of yesteryear, but in the mouth, which makes it that much worse. Aftertaste shows some somewhat better and lighter lime and lemon citrus notes, but the yeast and briney, salt components show stronger and leaves the palate somewhat salty and ready for the next sip, despite the perfume and funky yeast qualities. Overall, a pretty funky, pungent and odd-tasting beer that never seems to align with the style and/or what they were trying to produce, given the fact that the caster sugar, perfume and funky yeasts all hit about the same level and the citrus, brine and malt don't really show at all. Not really worth trying to find, unless you love your grandmother, her old perfume or a really funky yeast and citrus combination of a 'beer'. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 19-April-2019 for US$2,84 sampled at home in Washington on a warmer day here in 'Winter' on 25-January-2020.\n",
      "Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Quite thin with cardboard. The finish was short. Really nothing to write home about.\n",
      "From the label \"Reinterpreting international beer styles but adhering to the Reinheitsgebot\". Which is as bollocks as the beer. German Einheitsgebot fits better. As with many German beers they have removed any flavour, edge or character in the name of so-called cleanness of taste. It's basically a boring black lager with a tiny amount of extra dark malts and sweetness. Avoid\n",

      "# 982; 3/2018. Hodně prázdný pivo témř bez sladové složky, slizské s drsnou, nedobrou bylinnou hořkostí.\n",

      "Murky mess. Dodgy off fruit aroma. Messy taste. Fullish palate, but dirty and rough. Finish makes me want to scrape my tongue. What the fuck is this trying to be, it's certainly not a beer produced by any beer-making technique I'm familiar with. The only homebrew I ever threw away was way better than this. Shame on the brewer for releasing this garbage juice.\n",
      "Keg at In de Rosenboom, Amsterdam on 30/03/2007.  It seemed not so terrible at the time, having it in Amsterdam with a meal.  Pretty gritty lager, objectively.\n",
      "This is some rough stuff. Definitely not my thing. On the positive side, it's a very pretty beer. Deeply hazy straw yellow with a thick ice cream rocky head that leaves levees of thick lace. The aroma is pretty gross. Lots of cellar must, sea water, rotten grains., lemon, and hops. Flavors are not much better, and along similar lines but with a gym sweat and citrus fade.\n",
      "So, firestone's finally gittin round these parts. Its odd, because; right up the street we have the Firestone farms which is right next to the Firestone tires proving ground, go figger, you'd think somebody round here would have used the name first instead of some jokesters from the happy go lucky C state. This thing has a pour which is a somewhat hazy brew but probably not as muddy as a NE IPA should be. Maybe its all settled in the bottom of the can, heheh. Sharp IPA nose. Taste is what else? Its simply perfumy IPA all the way, I made a rhyme, gimmie a dime. At least it doesn't smell like BO or diesel. There, you have it; some kinda of IPA which is right in yer face, terribly on style.  What else can be said? Except its really hoopy hoppy bitter? Duh. Not impressed, this is so much just like so many other ubiquitous IPA's. There is a ton of these mahfahs.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 26/03/2007.  A rather synthetic tasting beer.  Clearly pasteurised and overly fizzy from force carbonation.  Not sure whether this was supposed to appeal to grot-pale lager drinkers?\n",
      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 24/03/2007.  Just super grim.  All the worst things about pasteurised, overly sweet bitters, then amped up with (probably more brewing sugar) to get a totally unbalanced level of alcohol.  Tasted like 6% going on 60%.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Sainsbury’s, Watford and drunk on 09/02/2007.  This wasn’t good, even before they sold out.  A slightly synthetic tasting, overly sweet, pasteurised bitter.\n",
      "Shorter stubby bottle. First taste is almost friendly fruity candy, with a bitter bite. Yes, somebody accidentally left the peels on these green unripened citrus fruits. Nice and hazy on pale is the eye. In the middle it starts to get unruly and sweet as well as perfumy, a little cloying. Yes, coconut and pineapple does not help here.  Yes, this is what seems to be an aged IPA turned into a fruity. Rude ass finish, fer sher. In the end it almost wants to be one of those holiday spiced beers. Did not enjoy, just a tick. Tropical its not.\n",
      "Can sample at a tasting. Clear golden with white head. The aroma has notes of acetaldhyde, alcohol, some fruitiness. The flavor is very sweet with notes of alcohol, honey, acetaldehyde. Full-bodied.\n",

      "Wygląd również bez zarzutu, opalizujące, bursztynowe. \n",
      "W aromacie są cytrusy, są jakieś chmiele, bergamotka, winogrona, bardzo spoko zapach, gdyby nie to, że bardziej niż chmiele czuć słody i diacetyl. \n",
      "W smaku zupełnie puste, trochę owocowe, w stronę gruszki/winogrona, ale bardzo wodniste. Żadnej goryczki, wysycenie niskie. Raczej zlew.\n",
      "500ml can from Lidl. Untasteful beer with some light sweetness. Very watery.\n",
      "Served from 375 ml bottle in tulip glass. A thick tan had drops slowly with mild lacing. Color is cloudy copper-brown. Aroma dominated by vinegar with yeasty malt background. Mouthfeel is light to medium, extremely carbonated. Flavor is unpleasant vinegar and overwhelming tartness. Not picking up any typical farmhouse ale flavors with this. Overall: I hope the sample I had was off somehow, because I could not finish this beer. Just too sour and tasted like a glass of vinegar.\n",
      "Sweet lacquer thinner aroma, has clearish copper body and modest head. Flavour is.... yeesh. Huge boozy sweetness, maybe some grain if I can recall what I my name is. Actually reminiscent of the cheap strong lagers I used to buy in Paris. Mouthfeel has lingering booze all over the place. It's inexcusable for Phillips to do something like this, they know how to hide alcohol so I don't know why they didn't bother here.\n",
      "Nothingness on the nose, has weak yellow body with bad foam. Flavour is soft grain - very, very soft grain. Mouthfeel is not crisp enough. This is a boring attempt at a bad style. Why bother?\n",
      "Veel te zoet en een raar chemisch caramelsmaakje bij deze Oud bruin. 3% alcohol. Het ligt niet aan Gulpener hoor. Oud bruin is gewoon niet mijn ding. Misschien met een blokje kaas.\n",

      "One of the worst Saison's I have ever had, and I hope it's not because I had just drank a Sour beer before hand.\n",
      "Nap's favorite, apparently. The Ginger really came through, but big surprise, the Peach did not.\n",
      "had at centre bell. didn't care for this at all. very thin with just a light caramel flavor. gave half of it away.\n",
      "Smells of nice weedy tequila, some soft grain too. Has okay foam on a deep gold body. Flavour is way too sweet and overbearing tequila, it made me shudder. Syrupy mouthfeel. This is just too much - cut this with seltzer water and it might be okay.\n",
      "Keg at Hop Stuff Brewery; Deptford.  Pretty sweet lager tasting beer.  Cinnamon and allspice dominate.\n",
      "Clear amber. Smells plenty of spices. Yes, even before I drink it, I'm alarmed. Taste is as expected, heavy on the spices, so much so you may not even be able to tell its a beer, except but maybe perhaps for the warming sensation that follows each slug down the gullet. Difficult downer, negative nellie, holiday hozer. Way to much personality for this lager lover. Oh well, its another dizzying tick. Medicinal finish. Not this one again. What's up with these overly spiced holiday brews? Who could luv these bastards?\n",

      "Hazy orange, peach and bronze glow with a thinnish, two centimetre tall tan head, relatively large-bubbled. Aroma of crisp citrus, very light floral notes, a small dash of alcohol and a faint hint of malts - very light in the nose. Light-bodied; Strong dry and herbal flavours at first with a tiny dose of citrus-based hops with no bitterness or alpha acids at all. Very mild and dry with almost no real flavours picked up in entirety, with a bit of sweetness on the tail end, but even that is mild. Aftertaste is subdued, just as the rest of this is - a faint dose of flavours and hay with little else, no malt or alcohol picked up - so faint, which dose actually make this a bad thing. Overall, a very boring and incredibly underwhelming beer - even for the style of a Light IPA! This tates like a low (or no) alcohol beer, and even then, not a good one! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased Shopper's Food Warehouse (on the last trip ever) in Alexandria, Virginia on 12-December-2019 for US$1,55 sampled at my house in Washington on 16-December-2019.\n",

      "As ugly as sin - murky off milk with black caviar floating on top - no thanks. Sweet coffee and white chocolate aroma. Slimy palate. Taste like the aroma, but the nose cannot prepare you for how sweet this shit is. \"People like gimmicks\" said Sue Hayward, a Team Toxic spokesperson. Nope, idiots like gimmicks, this person thinks it's an idiotic idea by idiots and for idiots. Gave mine away to some idiot child who just wanted to get drunk on something sweet. A fucking abomination.\n",
      "Draught in March 2019. Sweet, lots of sweet corn, additionally crayons as it warms up. Almost nothing to be felt besides the terrible flaws. An absolute disaster.\n",

      "Another straight up stupid ass beer from DFH. Got this from JR's in Rochester. Lots of alky for a couple of bucks, heheh.  Its virtually clear pale and I see its brewed with all kinds of happy bullshit; like apple juice, cinnamon and other fortnight beer additives, so be it, I'll give it a try, heheh. Creamy vanilla colored head. Make no mistake, this is another one of those awful spiced holiday brews, too much spice. Its quite rude but at least it is spiced to cover all its imperfections, just like the rest. You may simply  call it a Christmas  brew, it taste just like the rest; an insult to Christmas.  When are these beer companies going to jump off their high horse and try brewing some plain old good beer? Just asking. Yes, this is simply some way over the top ale, that has way too much spices in it. Get with it DFH, get back to your roots and quit chasing the money making niche of craft beer. You need to make just 12 really good beers. FORGETTAHBOUT all that happy bullshit. Get with it I say. Maybe you better go find some chemical analysis of some mummy's tomb and recreate the beer you think you found in the bottom of the sarcophagus. It just may be the chemical analysis of a dead body, no? Dead bodies are comfy in the bottom of a sarcophagus. They're moving on to some other better beer style.\n",

      "Ridiculously clear and golden coloured body with an ugly, fast-dying pure white head that stays afloat for a few seconds, at most. Aroma of yes, unflattering malt and water with some light corn sugar thrown in the mix, but this is pretty bad, especially in the nose. Ultra-light-bodied throughout; Strong grainy and malt-based flavours that show more corn and ricer and fillers than any actual malts with a very light sweetness from honey and corn syrup at the end, but only a dash of vegetal flavours come through that vary anything from the not-so-good malts and off-sugars. Aftertaste shows the pure corn syrup and funky malts throughout without much else aside from water. Overall, a pretty standard 'macro light' beer that you'd expect with funky malt compontents, a lot of bad and off-flavours that aren't so good. I sampled this tweleve ounce can, given to me by my coworker, purchased from Lidl in Manassas, Virginia on 16-October-2017 for US$3,99/six pack, sampled at home in Washington on 08-January-2020.\n",

      "The beer pours a dark amber caramel colour. Generating a small white, bubbly head. Carbonation in the glass starts aggressively, but rapidly peters out.. The head reclines to nothing within a minute. \n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is malt, chestnut purée and generic nuts. Cheap chocolate, reminding me of bad quality stouts and porters. Sweet with a light underlying bitter. Usually, even a poor beer smells inviting. This one just doesn’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is simply nut. Some can be identified as chestnut, some almond but mostly just a generic but taste. Some malt. Just like the aroma, cheap chocolate. Sweet like the aroma. The lightest lightest hint of bitter hop. \n",
      "\n",
      "The aftertaste is again nutty, with a flat mouthfeel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not a beer for me. Too monotone and feels as if it has been badly made, or made just poor ingredients.\n",
      "Tall boy pounder can gifted by Heather_B! Aroma is cranberry juice cocktail. I put my over ice and the flavor gets better as the ice melts! Ha ha ha. But that is how it’s meant to be served. Slight alcohol in the finish. Not the best of the series.\n",
      "Deutschland Lokaltausch 1/2019, danke an Moravius. Herb säuerlicher, trocken herber Antrunk. Geringe Würzigkeit, kein Hopfen, der säuerliche Touch wirkt fehlerhaft. Mittellanger Abgang, unsüffig, weiter trocken. 10/7/6/6/7/6\n",
      "(Flasche, warm) Es hat eine hellbraune Farbe, ist filtriert und von der Schaumkrone ist beim aufwärmen viel verloren gegangen. Das Aroma ist sehr kräftig, Sirup, Kirsche, etwas Mandel, Alkohol und etwas Putzmittel. Der Geschmack ist vergleichsweise schlank, süß, Sirupartig, etwas nussig, etwas Krische im Rachen und einen fruchtigen Abgang.\n",
      "Yea, superspak out did himself below! LOL. Me, I had this at the magic tree in boardman. It had an Iced tea color. Scummy head. A dull old pine hops nose. First taste was quite bitter and astringent. Some rude ass hops in there. I'm not much on highly hopped brews and the spruce in this really accentuates the hops. There, you have. Difficult for a lager lover.\n",

      "On tap at the magic tree in boardman.  Clear pale with a neutral nose. Not sure how these things can be called a stout, no stout attributes what so ever. Just a plain old pale beer as far as I'm concerned. White stout, that's pretty ridiculous! Disappointing to say the least. Get this thing off the stout train, stout it is not.\n",

      "\"Pfister 6,6er Bock\", Flasche von Hopfen & Malz, Berlin-Wedding. - Die Brauerei Pfister hat leider die unschöne Angewohnheit, ihre Biere unter ständig wechselnden Namen auf den Markt zu bringen. Es gibt schon einen Ökobock und einen dunklen Bock, beide mit 6,6 %, und nun diesen 6,6er Bock - das ist wohl mehr oder weniger das gleiche Bier, wenn es auch von Jahr zu Jahr etwas anders ausfallen mag. - Kupferrotbraun, trüb. - In der Nase aromatisches dunkel-toastiges Malz mit unangenehm süßlicher, faulig-gemüsiger Note. - Antrunk für einen Bock geradezu wäßrig dunkelmalzig mit etwas Kakao, Kirschkonfitüre, Karamel, Traubenzucker und eigenartig ranziger Note. Milder rezent, hefeweich aber nicht bocktypisch breit; leicht schnapsig. Im Abgang milde aber angenehme herbale Hopfenherbe, leider überlagert durch die fatale ranzig-süßliche Note. - Mißratener Bock, nur mit Mühe genießbar. (10.1.2020.)\n",
      "This is a waste of an awesome bottle. The moment this hit my mouth, I immediately spit it out. Something about a Mississippi beer being made in New York--not sure. I wanted this to be good. I will try it again in the future to try and gain redemption.\n",

      "50cl bottle. A minimal hazy pale yellow colour, small white head. Aroma of sweet juicy lemonade. Taste of sweet citrus lemonade, lime, sugar, no beer.\n",
      "Bottle picked up from Bernhard Nieder Getränkemarkt, Attenkirchen. Consumed at home Attenkirchen, Thursday 9th January 2020 listening to Steve Lamaqs Evening Session it's Round Table later on. Pours hazy, puddle brown with an off white head atop. This is pretty poor, there is caramel, but I am not enjoying it all, dusty aged feel to it, it's pretty ropey in fact I think that it's a drain pour for me.\n",
      "Can sample at a tasting at Max's place. Thanks Tom L. Clear golden. Alcohol, nail polish, sweet, boozy. Awful.\n",

      "Not a huge fan of this beer. Far too sweet with a strange aroma. Underlying beer is lost in the flavor.\n",
      "Tap at mad mex. Clear pale. Dull aged hop nose. Mild band aid taste. Not bad for an APA. No real negative hop attributes.\n",
      "Yellow body, smaller fast fizzy head, malty/grainy aroma and taste.  If you're looking for a thin, grainy lager you could probably do worse.  Mind you, you could spend a few cents more per bottle/can and do hell of a lot better.\n",

      "Tap at mad mex in robinson.  Clear pale with decent co2 on the palate. Taste is somewhat bitter. It also is a little medicinal in the middle. Difficult near the end. Heavy hop citrus bite. Weird, dull & aged slaggy hop ending.\n",
      "On tap at mad mex in robinson. Big & black with no head. Certainly smells like gingerbread. First taste is thicj, viscous, rich and almost cloying. No co2, must be on nitro; but I tell you, this needs some co2 to set it off. Sticky sweet and difficult in the middle. You really got to sip this stuff or it may make you gag. So difficult, or did I say that already. Alky is hidden, but it comes across like a chocolate liquor. Getting dizzy on the finish, whew.\n",
      "Clear golden with a one finger wide head.\n",
      "Malty smell with a hay note. Unbalanced taste for such a beer. It has this malty component typical for beers without alcohol, which can be a bit disturbing. And the end of the sip has a disagreeable bitterness, way too bitter for a Kölsch. Strong carbonation.\n",
      "Clear 275ml bottle found at a supermarket on Nevis. Pours bright girly clear pink with strong carbonation and foam gone fast. Flavour is sugary fake strawberry, I think I smell apple in there but I'm not sure. Flavour is fake strawberry with some apple and there's this cloying chemical aftertaste. Slightly worse than the original, but drinkable if near freezing and you're boozing it up at the beach bar and are so drunk you just don't care.\n",
      "Cask at GBBF 2006, Earl’s Court on 05/08/2006.  Not sure if this was served right and my notes were ‘toffee and butterscotch’.  Seem others thought the same at different times, so maybe was just a bad beer.\n",
      "Can from YIG in North Bay. \n",
      "Clear yellow pour, with a small white head. Aroma is straight up stale crackers, nothing more, nothing less, just stale and musty. No hops, cereals are bland, mouth feel is good though, carb is standard. Finish is lightly bitter, more crackers, and hints of grass. I cant tell if this is just old, or infected, or what, but i wont be returning.\n",
      "Bottle from total wine, St petersburg. Your regular Caribbean lager, perfect in a warm day, but nothing to write home about.\n",
      "Pours straw-yellow with a thin head. Acerbic aroma. Taste has very little of note, a little grassy malt. Palate has almost nothing of note. Bad.\n",
      "Clear bottle found in St. Kitts. Pours a green tinted yellow with barely any foam, and it's gone quick anyway. Smells of apple juice and very soft homebrew white wine. Flavour is weak apple juice with some vague alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is sugary. This isn't a colossal mess but it's certainly subpar, but I could see the appeal to a tourist... as long as it's chilled to near freezing and it's a brutally hot day. Brutally.\n",

      "\"Jadewölfe Herbstmond\", Fläschchen (MHD: 17.5.2020) von Hopfen & Malz (noch) im Wedding. - Goldbraun, gut trüb. - In der Nase herbfruchtige Jujube (chinesische Dattel), obergärige Fruchtigkeit von leicht künstlicher Süße (Kaugummi), Honig, weißer Pfeffer, vor allem aber eine intensive, leicht stechende Essigsäure, die bei Erwärmung immer penetranter wird. - Antrunk satt karamelmalzig und für einen Moment noch fruchtig süß, bevor der grelle essigartige Säurestich einsetzt, gegen den auch die aromatische krautige Hopfenherbe nicht mehr ankommt. Die Dattel schmeckt nurmehr leicht heraus. Durchschnittlich rezent, vollmundig; Alkohol ist nicht ganz kaschiert. Im Abgang ranzig essigsauer mit Resten krautiger Hopfenherbe. - Leider durch den penetranten Säurestich völlig verdorben. Hier hat wohl mal wieder ein Craft-Brauer die Hygiene auf die leichte Schulter genommen ... (7.1.2020.)\n",
      "Bottle. Red red amber with a decent head. Vegetable field clippings nose. Funky tangy flavor, something may be wrong with it. A bit sour flavor but without the usual acidity.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy amber color with white head. Aroma is soap, berries, lots of soap, vegetables. Taste is the same, super infected. Foamy carbonation. Blergh.\n",
      "I've not had a \"craft beer\" taste so much like Bud Light before. It was plain, kind of nauseatingly cereal-y, grassy, again plain, just kind of gross. Notes of overplayed beer pong. Honestly just bad. No effort here.\n",
      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 14/05/2006.  A very bland beer.  Czech hops aren’t necessarily the most in your face, but surely they could have brewed some kind of beer to showcase them?  This was all malt and not very pleasant.\n",

      "Black pounder can from JR's. Typical beer smell. Clear pale with a big giant head, wants to overflow my mug. Rather flat but not quite on the palate. Seems a little rude with many ill ale attributes. Stronger attitude, alky shows thru with ease. Some astringent bitterness building in the back of the throat. A little thick and syrupy in the end. Not impressed. Finishes with that bitter astringent bite becoming prominent. Probably should be listed as an IPA, comes across like a weak, aged IPA.\n",
      "Deutschlandtausch #1/19, danke Moravius. Milder, leicht süßer und getreidiger Antrunk. Trocken malzig, Karamellnoten, geringfügig herb. Mittellanger Abgang. Eher langweilig. 9/6/7/7/7/6\n",
      "At £8.20 for a 440ml can I actually got a good price on this beer from Brads Beers in Rotherham indoor market. But I found it very regrettable. To me it tastes exactly like a swisher sweets chocolate cigar. Artificial and synthetically sweet.  Had it not been so expensive I would score it higher, but I was not impressed with this beer one bit. It tasted false.\n",
      "Dark brown in color with a hazy almost muddy clarity, poured with a half finger skim of thin looking tan colored head that has poor retention and leaves a thin watery ring of lace that slides down the side of the glass. \n",

      "Fairly sweet and heavy bodied with a moderately chocolaty tasting malt forward with ghostly note of hazelnuts to it, front end feels a little cloying and over sweet but not all that bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finish is fairly bitter tasting with a green sapling leaf hop flavor to it that grows as it warms, as well as an odd, hard to define flavor that I associate with a macro brew, like the back end of something like a Molson Canadian, a lingering faintly sour vaguely  chemical tasting like a bad fake flavored cough syrup with a faint trace of ethanol that hangs out on the aftertaste and builds up to be unpleasant\n",
      "19-Oct-19 (16-oz can, No date stamp: Purchased 13-Sep-19 for $5.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)This Imperial IPA pours a fully cloudy, golden-yellow body and an inch of bubbly, rocky, white head that settles to a partial dusting and thin ring, leaving a few spots of lacing on the beer-clean glass.  The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.  Overall, this is not enjoyable to drink.  It's harsh, astringent, very bitter, and tastes like eating garden weeds.  What an unfortunate first impression with this beer brand.\n",
      "05-Jan-20 (16-oz can, No date stamp: Purchased 14-Dec-19 for $5.49 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)This Hazy Imperial IPA pours a fully hazy/cloudy, golden-orange body with an inch of off-white head that settles to a patchy sheet and thin ring, leaving a thin ring and spotty lacing on the beer-clean glass.  The nose projects a dominant aroma of bitter orange peel, with notes of orange juice and resin in the background.  On the palate, the dominant flavor of orange peel and grapefruit pith is bitter and harsh; I might as well have taken a bite out of an unpeeled orange and chewed it up, peel and all.  There's plenty of orange juice flavor, maybe some mango, but the harsh orange peel character is all I can think about.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and obviously, pretty astringent.  Overall, another terrible beer from Abomination.  It's not so much that this is over-hopped, although an argument could be made that it is, but rather it's just very poorly executed, so all the harsh astringency remains in the finished beer.  Second beer out of three like this from Abomination, so maybe the name fits.  Absolutely not enjoyable and not a beer I'll finish.  Insert vomiting emoticon here...\n",
      "Tämligen fadd smak som inte är särskilt angenäm. Intressant att alkoholhalten är angiven till att vara mellan 4 och 6 procent. Nja, det finns bättre från Vietnam.\n",
      "Can. Coz za dziwny produkt, slodki, diacetyl, piana srednia, malo trwala, splywa szybciej niczym reka po jedwabnej poscieli. Slokdosc, malo chmielnosci, kompletnie zle uwarzone. Bardzo wodniste i raczej przypominalo mi powszechnego strong lagera mimo niewielkiej ilosci alkoholu. Niedawno testowane piwo bezalkoholowe bylo przynajmniej dwa razy lepsze. Dziwne to dla mnie zamieszanie ale tak to0 odczuwam.\n",
      "Drunk in early 2019. Cocoa butter, green apple, ashy roast, molasses, coffee, light incense-like smoke. Almost no body, rough, astringent, boozy finish. One of the worst beers I have ever had, and that from an otherwise reliable brewer. Booze, acetaldehyde and ash dominate. What a waste.\n",

      "330ml bottle from Morrison’s, Hatch End and drunk on 18/04/2006.  Fairly grim and lacking anything except a quite sweet, sugary, malty note that wasn’t very pleasant.  I think if I were on a diet, it might be kinder to myself to just skip beer altogether.\n",
      "Draught at Liebesbier in 2018. Yellow fruit, estery notes giving way to solvent. Empty flavour. Boring and not well made.\n",
      "It tastes like someone put Mountain Dew and a bunch of Warheads in a blender. This is a beer where the first few sips come off as drinkable, but the overpowering sweetness and tang become too much halfway through the bottle. I like a good sour. This isn't one of them.

      "On tap at Kraftpaule, pours a filthy opaque yellow with a small white head. Aroma is characterized by lots of chalky yeast in typical incompetent hazy fashion, with moderate dank hops and stone fruit pith. Flavour is very filthy, with lots of chalky yeast, dank hops, earthy notes, and bready malt. So damn chalky and harsh. Exactly what I hate about this style.\n",
      "# 1719; 1/2020. Candy. Deep gold. Very candy, sweet without bitterness. Very bad beer. 0,5 l bottle, market, Waidhaus (D).\n",
      "Это точно не портер! Причем ни как эль, ни как балтийский портер. По мне, так это просто темный лагер. Заявленная плотность сусла в 20%, совсем не чувствуется. По стилю совсем мимо.\n",
      "A bitter pint of stuff served in a Christmas selection because they can't get rid of it any other way. Tasted like wax mixed with turpentine, with a bit of hops for good measure. Not the sort of thing you should let your Nan buy you for Christmas.\n",
      "Tap (Beer Herpes, Chester) (5:2:3:2:6=1.8)\n",
      "Everything you need to know about this beer is shown in the pump clip. Namely that this has as much relation to beer as the the verbal reference to Simon le Bon in the name has to the visual reference to Nick Rhodes on the pump clip. I.e. bugger all. It's mostly lemonade, with obvious kettle souring. Bland aroma, offensive taste, harsh.\n",

      "Dark. Berry juice aroma. Tartish palate. Off berry juice taste. Garbage juice.\n",
      "Tap at the brewery. Slightly hazy light golden color. White head. Light malty aroma. Bread. Yeasty flavor. Bread and trub. A bit phenolic with a touch of party balloon rubber.\n",
      "473 ml can from the LCBO. Pours a lightly cloudy pale golden colour with small white head.  Aroma is candyish peach that dominates most anything else - this smells like some sort of cooler.  Flavour is sweet, artificial peach with some graininess.  This sucks.\n",
      "It’s like urine. The color is almost the same as urine. Will definitely not try again.\n",
      "I’m sure I did  something horrible in a previous life to have mistakenly cracked this beer. I’ve never sink poured a beer and Im not gonna start now so I’ll just have to muscle through this one . It’s no Cantillion, but it beats prison toilet wine any day...um according to a friend . Side note , how does one naturally ferment an 8% or higher beer and sell 25 oz cans for 99.¢ at retail and manage to turn a profit? Asking for a freind\n",
      "Pours a cloudy golden color. Aroma artificial lemon, light light hops. Taste is the same, sweet, some honey.\n",
      "Sampled this one at Pegasus Pizza on campus, and you already know I went with the other one.\n",
      "Pours clear with little head. Aroma of malt. Taste has....nothing. Palate has nothing. Cheapest beer I’ve ever had. Alcoholic water\n",
      "This beer has a very blah taste, also has a strong malt taste to it.    Won't be buying this beer again. Had to drink it with clam to kill to kill the bitter taste.\n",
      "I have been a fan of Badger for many years but I have to wonder how this made it to the market. \n",

      "Aroma is reminiscent of Spam not the most welcome sent in a beer. \n",

      "First beer of 2020. Another infected beer from this brewery. Murky copper body with a mid sized, persistent ivory head. Aroma is tarty, vineous, oxidized. Taste is sour, mild caramel notes. Long sour finish. Medium body, average/fizzy carbonation, oily texture\n",
      "330ml bottle sample.  Oh man, they weren’t joking about the sour, but this is just another level of tart and soapiness.  It kind of tastes like drinking juice right after you’ve brushed your teeth.  Super grim, I’m afraid to say.\n",

      "0,5l Flasche. Dunkelbraunes Bier. Malzbierduft, künstliche Kirsche. Sehr süsser Geschmack. Malzbonbon, Holunderbeere, Kirsche. Das Zeug hat nur ca. 0,2% Kirschanteil, das ist gerade mal 1 ml! Was soll das?!!?\n",

      "Honestly it is not too different from Aussie megaswill which you only drink when desperate.\n",
      "473ml can. hazed pour with a white soapy head. Aroma is similar to hefeweizen but boozy, banana, clove, gogurt. flavor is sweet, gogurty, no bitterness, this is trash for an ipa.\n",
      "30-12-2019; bottle; at the Swedish house (bought somewhere in Sweden).\n",
      "The looks of the beer are simple. Just a golden yellow crystal clear Lager with a frothy white head with average foam retention. \n",
      "The aroma of the beer is just as simple. Nice, but simple. Bready malts, herbal hops. Not much more. But, quite clean and fresh. Nice.\n",
      "The taste of the beer is the same. Pure malt sweetness, bitter hops. Quite a nice balanced beer. \n",
      "Palate is simple too. Light body, thin texture and high carbonation. The finish of the beer is short and has some hop bitters. All in all, quite a nice beer. Simple and straight forward, but good.\n",
      "It's a bastard for sure. Pouring a hazy orange gold color with a white head. Aroma of funk, bad water and orange baby aspirin.  Tastes completely under cooked and just bad. Nasty and undrinkable.\n",
      "Bleach white foam and light yellow heavily carbonated body, smells like dryer lint with a vague hint of hay. Flavour is inoffensive sugar and the mouthfeel is smooth. For the \"let's get wasted\" Euro lager crowd this isn't half bad - it won't be completely disgusting as you chug it, which is about the only metric you can use for these strong lagers.\n",
      "Can found in Guadeloupe. Pours heavily carbonated yellow and the head is gone way too quick. Smells of burlap, soya sauce, and white wine. Flavour is soft grain and that's it. Lingering adjuncts on the mouth but they are pretty mellow compared to what I expected. This could have been alot worse, it will go down easy enough if you're into this kind of alcohol delivery system.\n",
      "Draft at the brewpub.  Dank appearance but drinks with a weird peppery twist atop a moist, mushy ale.  Little off balance and not citrusy at all. \n",

      "# 1711; 12/2019. Malty aroma. Gold body. Sweet, grainy, citrus, candy. Finish is very candy. Very poor german pilsner. 0,5 l bottle, shop, Schönsee (D).\n",
      "Z butelki poszło jakąś stęchlizną piwniczną, uff. Piana jasno brązowa, wybiła średnia, złożona z drobnych i średnich pęcherzy, powoli się redukowała, lekko szyła. zredukowała się do odrobiny na powierzchni. Kolor ciemnego brązu, trunek przejrzysty. Aromat no znów idzie lekko oborą, piwnicą, są też słód, pieczarki, karmel, ale to tak mocno na obrzeżach. Smak lekko skwaśniały, gdzieś w tle jest słód, do tego może odrobina chmielu. Nie raczej to wszystko mocno słabe, nie da się pić niestety.\n",
      "Something is miss with this beer, sampled off the tap in the High Point Liberty location. Mild aroma of orange peel, gym sweat, and mint. Tastes a lit like undercooked malt. Virtual no hop presence aside from undefined hints of mint. No reall English malt character. Sloppy.  Needs a lot of work.\n",
      "Rating this after sampling perhaps the worst thing I ever tasted, so I'll probably be generous here. This has to be a Food Lion can. Giant one too. Clear gold, lots of bubbles up the side, soft white head. Nose of corn, metal, light trash water. Flavor is sweet grasses, artificial sweetener, bread crust, plastic. This is bad... shocker.\n",
      "Can thanks to Drake. I've been advised I might not survive this one. Pours off-clear, few bubbles, no head. Looks like slightly dirty water. The smell is bad... copper pipe, plumbing issues, light pear. Aww. That flavor is awful. Old copper pipe water, very metallic, light soap, light pear. This is undrinkable. I concur: these people should be ashamed of themselves.\n",

Like other Molson products it has its own Molson taste.... It's just Molson beer. Low carb? Yeah sure, low alcohol? Fantastic. This is craptastic stuff.\n",
      "Pours dark yellow with a linguring thin white head.  This one is highly carbonated and has a rich and oily mouth feel.  The taste is quite sweet with minimal hop bitterness and high levels of alcohol noticeable.  However, it doesn't have that burn on the aftertaste that you would expect for an abv of close to 9%.  This is not the type of beer that I go for but it was good to try a strong lager (or malt liquor) to compare it to standard everyday lagers.\n",

Pours very clear pale gold, lighter than the color of the water coming out of old copper pipes that has been sitting for awhile; tiny white head. Grainy, grassy, lightly metallic aroma... faint. Flavor is grain, metallic water, corn, envelope glue. Very thin... a step above water, but I'm going to finish this.\n",

      "Can: Poured a pale yellow color Berliner Weisse with a medium size white foamy head. Aroma of fake syrupy notes with light tart notes.

Never like any other beer and I've had in this while I'm not a big fan of salt. average white head on top of a an opaque gold and brown body. I'm not going to lie here, it smells like salt. With the coriander and the sea salt and taste like I'm drinking liquid seasoned salt. If you like this style you might it's probably good but I don't so this is probably one of the worst beers I've ever had.\n",

Admittedly, I know that Burton water has a higher level of sulphur, but most times I had this beer, it had such a discernible nose of rotten eggs.  Occasionally, this would spill over into the beer, which would also taste eggy.  Could never work out why people drunk this.\n",

Reminds me of the Aroma of the toilets at the Windsor hotel after a long weekend. No joke. A fluid so foul should not be associated with \"Beer\" which by the way should translate to Nectar of the gods, along side a single malt whiskey!\n",
      "you always find lots of natural light cans, bottles, and cardboard boxes littered along roads, under bridges, and along railroad tracks - it must be a popular beer...so i decided to see what all the hype was about on my quest to find the best light beer. aroma isnt bad - has that standard mixed dusty grain, corn, yeast, and very faint skunky hop scent. flavor is a muddled mix of stale grain, corn syrup, grass and other unidentifiable vegetal flavors - dry and numbing carbonation encouraging another pull. not too good but for a low end budget beer i guess a case would go down easy in a box car - the off flavors fade before you realize theyre bad so you end up drinking more\n",
      "Really not my thing, although that may be due to me not liking Weizen in general and \"light\" doesn't make it better. The beer has the typical Weizen flavor with a good load of banana, but it feels quite watery and doesn't manage a good mouth feel.\n",

      "Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this. Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice crystal clear super pale straw hue with no discernible head. Aromas of light yeast funk, definitely dry not sweet. Minimal apple aroma.  Taste is similar to the nose, little funky, bone dry. I get a nice wave of crisp fresh apples before being inundated with off flavours along the line of plastic bandaids. Ugh. Sweeter apples try to break through but that really, really aggressive and unpleasant boarding on burnt plastic and rubber cuts through it all. Finish is bone dry but the carbonation is next to nothing. This might be one of the worst ciders I've had.\n",

Inoffensive aroma of corn, water that’s sat in cooper pipes for decades, grasses. Could have been much worse. But good god it should be better. Flavor is envelope glue, corn, grasses, rubbing alcohol.\n",
      "Giant can from food lion. This was going to be a milestone beer but I just couldn’t wait. Murky chocolate ham tasting.  Pours pink. Just pink. Smells like magic, death, and childhood. Perhaps some wet or even dead dog. maybe both. Flavor is watermelon, 99% sugar water, and some strange somewhat toxic-like flavors.\n",

Schroffe krautige Herbe geht in derbe Bittere über. Gut rezent. Im Abgang kräftige krautige Bittere. - Noch so ein Bier, das bereits 2 Monate vor Erreichen des MHD umkippt. (22.12.2019.)\n",
      "Can. 4.4%. Best before 10.09.20. Pours a hazy yellow/light amber, with a disappearing, white head. Slight lacing. Cereals/vegetables/corn aroma. Remote hint of citrus. Remote sour note, increasing a bit as it warms. Light dusty overtone. Flavour is pretty much the same. Medium bitter finish. Somewhat tart, and a bit grainy. Lingering light toffee-ish malty note. A bit too much carbonation. Overall not that good. 22.12.19.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 20/10/2005.  Not quite as dreadful as their rhubarb beer, but still absolutely appalling.  This was total adjunct flavour and tasted like I had a mouthful of apple flavour Moam sweets and then took a swig of Greene King IPA before swirling it around in my mouth for a bit.\n",
      "Aroma of BMC.  Tastes like metallic cardboard, wet paper bag, old corn.  Yuck.  Down the drain.\n",
      "The guy warned me that the carbonation on this was off but that wasn't the only problem with it - it stunk of nail polish remover (at 3.6% abv!) and tasted like chemicals. Maybe they need to clean their lines but this seemed downright dangerous to drink. Luckily he swapped it out for something else, but I can't recommend this for any reason to anyone.\n",

Flavour is extremely yeasty and chalky, with dank hops, filthy yeast and chalky, and some stone fruit pith. This is exactly what I hate about this style: poor clarity, high in chalk and yeast, lacking bitterness. Crap.\n",
      "draft - reminds me of High Life and this is how I rated High Life:  pours pale yellow with quickly diminishing white head.  Nose is cardboard.  Flavor is corn, trace malts and faint hops.  taste is sweeter than I remember it being and slightly less bitter as well.  Sticky mouthfeel with watery texture.  I also recall there being a smokiness, but it is not there.  I must say the nostalgia will bump up the overall scoring.\n",

      "Can 1 pint. Pours an almost clear golden with a rich and frothy head - looks like a Czech Pils! Aroma is very subtle, lurking underneath the dense head - spiced in an odd way. Medium body, veryperfumy and then dry to an extreme defgree where astringency sets in. I very much doubt that this is what was intended. It doesn't taste like maple at all and it's so astringent that it's like chewing painkillers. Misfit, sorry. 201219\n",
      "Can, 4.5%. Energy drink aroma. Very pale yellow colour. No head. The flavour is sweet but not as sweet as other energy drinks. Also has the energy drink type flavour.\n",
      "Very weak apple on the nose, has simple clear yellow body. Flavour is boozy apple and nothing else. Mouthfeel has cloying alcohol - seriously, only 6 percent and it smells like nail polish remover? What a mess, this shouldn't be served.\n",
      "Can from explosivedog: pours ugly murky orange. Aroma is like a dirty 711 Slushie machine and graham crackers... I guess on point. Taste is extremely sour and acidic. Weird vanilla and pastry tastes are in there. This is truly barely drinkable.\n",
      "This is not a cider I would never drink again. Artificial sweeteners in cider is a disgusting idea. It doesn't need artificial sweeteners added, it will be sweet enough WITHOUT the artificial crap.\n",

      "Can. Nose of sewer pipe, and crushed rotten fruit. Clear medium gold color. Harsh fruity flavors, rough sweet and sour stuff. Big carbonation jump in mid palate. Ouch! Yuck! Label says \"beer taste\" -- well, hardly, says I. Herkules hops -- so what? Avoid this one.\n",
      "Canned, 330ml from Aldi in Banbury, Oxon. Gold with white head. Straight into a boiled caramel flavour with this along with damp carpet musty notes. Heavily carbonated. Boiled malts throughout. Not good at all for me.\n",
      "Year old $2 bottle from house of 1000 in warrendale. So, this must be erd's attempt at a hopped brew? Fairly clear pale with a white head, almost overflows my mug. Taste is somewhat pilz I'd say, not much hefe in this stuff. I'd say its more like an attempt at a wheat ale, thank you. YEa, too bitter for a hefe, nothing really in common with a hefe. A little misleading, WTF? I guess I should have looked closer at the label, it has a big green hop on it. Oh well. At least t has decent carbonation. I bet this could pass as a session IPA, no lie.\n",

      "There is no taste. Bland, boring, and forgettable. To be kind, there are no off flavours and there is nothing offensive. The cleanness is, however, not enough to remotely save this beer. There is lacing on the head, but it disappears so fast.\n",
      "I let this guy sit too long.  Pours reddish gold with a small white wisp.  Some elderberry skins and yeast clumps (I hope..)   Aroma was intense vinegar with a light sweetness.  I didn't have very much.  It was intense, teeth enamel peeling vinegar.  There is a touch of sweetness from the elderberries and the brett but it is overshadowed.  Hopefully they do this again so I can have another crack at it and drink it a little sooner.\n",
      "355ml bottle, drank on 15th  Dec 2019 while in California. Clear and clean amber body, plenty of carbonation bubbles rising through but no head what so ever. Sweet pumpkin aroma and taste. I am no expert on Pumpkin ales, but this is by far the worst I have come across; just awful.  Too sweet even for my sweet tooth.\n",
      "Bottle, mid 2018. Pale malt, yeast, overcarbonation, also some grapefruit notes but not nearly enough. Watery and overcarbonated.\n",
      "Pours a cloudy golden color with thick white head. Notes of lemon, soapy. Drinkable on hot summer day.\n",

      "473ml can. Pours a very dark brown with full head that settles quickly. Aromas of roasted malts and metallic coffee grounds. Flavors of plastic, stale black coffee, and watery toasted malts. Nope.\n",
      "# 718 et # 1672; 4/2017 et 12/2019. Yeast and citrus in aroma. Yellow-gold, hazy, poor head. Sour tangerine, lime. Sour-sweet finish. Bad Weissbier. 0,5 l can, market (Lidl), Třemošná (CZ).\n",
      "Not sure there are any taste notes. Will not buy again thin yellow not appealing to this drinker, the bad chinese food I bought today to go with it is a good match. Glad I just got 1 can\n",
      "When I am king, citrus adjuncts will be outlawed. This travesty will be first to face the block. Disgusting sour fizz. Like Tango sans the sugar.\n",
      "hazy golden to orange colour, medium sized dense and quite stable white head; aroma of corny-grainy-wet wheaty and slight grassy notes; taste of a sweet malt drink;  not good at all\n",
      "Flasche im Supermarkt. Goldener klarer Körper mit viel Schaum. Aroma: Hopfen und Malz, etwas künstlich. Getreide. Geschmack: Malzig, metallisch. Getreide, aber auch etwas schweres und auch wenig angenehmes auf der Zunge.\n",
      "Wenig Bitterkeit.\n",
      "Smells of burning rubber, methyl ethel keytone, dried out motor oil, rubbing alcohol, some black lithographic crayons dumped in paint thinner, in general it's all coming off a mess. Has a dark blackish brown body and okay foam on top of it. Flavour is way too boozy, maybe there's some coconut in there but it's overpowered by this heavy nail polish remover hanging on to my tongue and burning it. Mouthfeel is this lingering piles of chemicals and there's also a barfable level of fusel alcohol sticking around. This is a cloying chemical mess.\n",
      "Murky golden body with a big, stable and foamy white head. Aroma is tarty, so the taste. Super infected batch. Should be a pils, but tastes and smells like a berliner weisse/gose. no way! Waste of money. Disappointed. Never again.\n",
      "Lousy stout, with a fizzy, cola-like feel coupled with pronounced char notes on top of seltzery blandness. Not worth discussing further.\n",
      "UGH!  Horrid stench of weed, skunk behind, and fusel alcohol.  Might be the worst smell I've ever had of beer.  Tastes like old eggs, bad herbal funk, and some mango in the finish desperately trying to save it.  Two sips and...just no.  Drainpouring this.  I haven't had an especially bad beer in awhile, but this was just AWFUL.\n",
      "I'm so tired of these hero beers, they all pretty much taste the same so here goes another. I suspect it will be some totally bitter thicker hopped beer, as usual. This can was only a buck and a half at vintage. On pop there is lots of hops permeating the area. Clear pale. Taste is mouth coating veggie hops with decent co2. The co2 is a positive considering how hopped this IPA is. Bitter linger on the sides of the tongue after each big swig. Pretty big impression on the hops, you'd swear its above 5% fer-sher. Why would anybody want to subject their palate to hop bitterness without much alky kick? Just asking.\n",
      "What a disaster. Watery toffee taste. Is this beer or is this a wanna be?  Disappointing\n",
      "Pours a clear pale yellow from the bottle with bubbly white head that leaves light lace. Aroma and taste of burnt yeast and a slight wort with no hops whatsoever. This is pretty much what I expect non-alcoholic beer to be like, nothing like beer.\n",
      "Smells of very cloying heavy boozy caramel, has lots of clear cloying brownish red and modest foam. Flavour is syrupy cherry and malt and harshness. Mouthfeel has way too much overbearing sweetness. Nothing is working here, just harshness all around.\n",

I'll have tah git one from the grocers. Anyway, this is simply a big bitter beer and if monk fruit is supposed to sweeten it, I'm not sure. What ever. Nasty nellie. Smells like contemporary IPA.\n",
      "This “root beer” doesn’t taste like a root beer. It tastes like a sparkling dip cup. Honestly, the wintergreen is so strong, it was incredibly reminiscent of Skoal Wintergreen spit. Would not recommend to anyone. I poured the entire 6 pack out after one sip. Wouldn’t gift to people I hated. Would give 0/10 if I could.\n",

      "On n'est pas loin d'avoir touché le fond avec cette Turbeau Noir, dont le nom est trompeur car il s'agit ici d'une bière fruitée par adjonction de concentré de fruits des bois. On ne parle donc pas ici de fruits des bois ayant macéré dans le brassin mais bien d'un ajout de concentré, ce qui n'est tout de même pas la panacée. La base est de plus complètement ratée. Avec un ajout de fruits sucrés, une petite acidité est nécessaire afin de couper le sucre et donner du peps à l'ensemble. Ici la base est sucrée, ce qui rend le tout sur-sucré, et en lus sans finesse, sans complexité, et sans intérêt si ce n'est de conférer des arômes de caramel, et de cola quelque peu chimique. Je ne vois pas quelle est la cible de cette bière. Le visuel se porte sur un brun un peu rosâtre surmonté d'une mousse brune d'un cm. Même si le nez n'est pas exceptionnel, finalement celui-ci n'est pas si mal vu la dégustation avec un cocktail de fruits des bois, de caramel et une fraîche amertume. Malheureusement l'amertume ne permet pas d'équilibrer la sucrosité à la dégustation ce qui la rend lourde et écœurante, surtout que les arômes quelque peu chimiques ne sont pas agréables. L'alcool à 8 % ne se ressent pas du tout et ne donne aucun caractère. Corpulence et longueur sont plutôt bonnes, mais à quoi bon? J'ai déjà trop écrit et donc perdu mon temps pour ce breuvage.\n",

      "Allow me to retort: Jager through and through, with an unbearable amount of star anise overpowering every other aspect of the beer. Add a little honey and you’ve got fizzy Zarbee’s cough syrup. Intriguing, unique, remarkable, and absolutely undrinkable.\n",

      "Baby blue can for $250 at vintage boarbman, nice place. Decent wet-waxy pour with a thicker foamy head. Smell of volatile citrus IPA is permeating the immediate area. Thicker deep resinous palate, viscous. Nasty nellie negative nightmare on the taste buds, this stuff must be double imperial IPA, no lie!  Quite a ball buster. So thick so rich and terribly on trippel IPA style, man this is a slap in the face. Whew. Haven't had one of these rubber inner tube chewed soaked in pine tar sap for a long long time, so big, so fat it kicked may ass. Love IPA? Ignore my numbers, you got to seek this out, its straight up bullshit ass wide hops like making me see stars with every swig! There, you have it!! Big bitter impact clear to the end and even a half hour later, taste does not like to fade. Kowahbungah. Something that most pale lager lovers may not be able to endure.\n",
      "Just like the original, I just don't get this beer.  It has some peanut butter flavor, but also tastes just dirty.  The color is fine but the flavor is just bad.  Don't get the love.\n",
      "Really really nasty. Like cold watered down hot chocolate that has gone off. When I didn't finish the pint (I only had a few sips) the pub lady asked me what I thought and when I explained my view she wholeheartedly agreed. She said that it was the least liked beer they ever had and the only one most people never finish. She also said they were never going to have it again. Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "Draught @ Mig & Ølsnedkeren. Pours clear light golden with a small offwhite head, light lacings. Aroma of malt, little grain, light hay, heavy butter. Flavor is sweet, malty, grain, hay, some butter - not as bad oak nose. Medium body, average to lively carbonation, sweet heavy buttery finish. Erkkkk. 111219\n",

A very one dimensional ale with a very, slight hint of chocolate, certainly not the hit of deep chocolate that can work so well with a complex porter or stout. I should have read the ingredient list.  The glucose syrup would have warned me that that was probably a watery, indifferent attempt at a  chocolate porter. Shame on me.\n",

      "This beer smells absolutely terrible. Tons of grapefruit and assloads of gym sweat, onions and rotting sea life.  Lightly tart flavor with plenty of bright grapefruit,  tart lemon,  and gym shorts. A bit of a salty tart finish.\n",
      "Cloying fruit sugar on the nose, has clear pink body with no foam. Flavour is sugar and fake fruit soda. Mouthfeel is all soda carbonation. This is soda pop cider, maybe as expected.\n",
      "Draft: Poured a reddish tinted brown and a thin tan head. Aroma is spices and mint. Taste is so heavily spiced and weird mint that they could have figured out brewing a taxi cab smell into a beer.\n",
      "The aroma is dry pasta and dirty socks. Has a dark clearish copper body and very little foam. Flavour is all heavy boozy caramel, it made me shudder. Mouthfeel is all a bad cloying sugar aftertaste. This thing has everything you don't want in a barleywine. Maybe it could be aged to dial down the harshness but something tells me it still wouldn't fix some issues going on.\n",
      "2019 big bottle shared at Eric's. Pours a clearish pink color without much head. Notes are nothing but chlorine, acetone, and cyanide. This was so fucking bad that it won worst in show with 40+ entries at this tasting. We all immediately drained. So disappointing since blend B and original Cygnus was so good.\n",
      "Optisch echt super, riecht aber als sei ne Flasche 47/11 übers Sofa gekippt. Zimt und Rosenwasser, holla die Waldfee. Im Trunk ebenso abenteuerlich, schwer zu glauben, dass das ein Stout ist.\n",
      "0,33l Flasche. Na danke Ato. Hellbraun oranges Bier. Dünner Schaum. Malzduft süss. Flacher Geschmack. Sehr metallisch. Unrund malzig. Nicht gut.\n",
      "Aroma of diesel and BO, nasty nose.  Clear pale. Taste is not as bitter as expected but it starts to get more bold in the middle. Yes, now I'm thinking its not as rude as was expecting. Better than most IPA because I don't like IPA. In the end, its probably more like a stronger APA.\n",
      "0,33l Flasche. Weisser Schaum. Honig, Grasduft. Geschmack süss. Sonst eigentlich nichts. Da gibt es wirklich keinen Grund zumtrinken. Traurig.\n",
      "0,5l Flasche. Danke Ato! Hellbraun-gelbes Bier. Der Kenner sagt: Haselnusston! Schaum zerfällt. Kräftige Bananennoten. Leichte Säure. Metallischer Hefegeschmack. Brotteig. Warum macht Eichbaum sowas? Ach ja, wegen Geld!\n",
      "Tap at the BrewLounge in Firestone Farms. Almost clear pale, last draft on the keg. IPA nose but no BO. Big bitter typical IPA impact, even bordering on imperial IPA. Some band-aid in there. Mouth coating and rude, big long bitter linger. Typical example of a domestic nasty imperial IPA. Terribly on style. Ignore my numbers if you like IPAs. This stuff is really on style. I can't stand IPA and did this for a tick, so the lower my numbers the more you'll like it my friendly IPA lover.\n",
      "Nice can, cloudy amber beer with cream-colored head, smell is very artificial, citrus, sweetness, taste is heavy sweet, sugar, citrus, I can’t feel the IPA here, soft carbonation, thin texture, medium body, short bitter finish, \n",

      "Canned, from Systembolaget.  Hazy deep golden mid sized head. Fruity nose with lots of boiled cabbage. Sweetish with light body and clean, rounded mouthfeel. Fruity and bready with lots of butter, sugar and DMS. Low bitterness. Too sweet and dominated by off flavours. Low drinkability.\n",
      "No muy buen sabor, el gas toma el mayor protagonismo y tiene un sabor metálico y un poco maltoso, depronto con un poco de lúpulo extra o un amargor extra estaría mejor. Hay muchas mejores y por el mismo precio, teniendo en cuenta que de por sí, es muy económica.\n",

      "Schon sehr verdächtig: Flaschenform und Etikette machen auf Hipp! Farbe goldgelb, Kohlensäure perlt zu leicht. Schaumkragen steht, aber dünn. Geruch ist klar: Standardlager (Einheitspfütze). Geschmack entspricht dem Geruch. Ergo: langweilige Massenproduktion!\n",
      "Smells of rotting wet socks just pulled out of the hamper in a hockey locker room, has clear yellow with little foam like you just wrung those socks out and put it in a glass. Flavour is more of that cloying rotten sock with vague citrus orange notes. Very bad aftertaste. I can't get past it reminding me of rotting rancid socks from a 23 year old semi-professional hockey player - that's just not something I want to drink.\n",
      "OK, look.  I generally like Pittsburgh brewing beers but to call this IC Light is an insult to the rock of IC Light. How fricken rude to bastardize a respected name. This is simply a light pale beer  with artificial flavors added, it is so fake it is near cloying. SO uncool. Its the balls on the barnacles at the bottom of the bombardier's barrel. First off, it looks like IC light, no color to make you think its cherry flavored.  It also smells like a cheap red Popsicle. Its fizzy and tastes something like cheap red soda, but nothing like the quality flavors of Cherokee red. Typical wan-nah be accepted new fru- fru -fruity beer. Whew. Probably should be kept out of the ratings like other stupid straight up ass soda pop flavored malt beverages. The artificial sweetener in this yields a lingering unpleasant perfume like finish  on each swig right to the end. Disappointing, not really beer; JMHO. I was fooled into buying the barn on a sixer of these pounder cans of near beer for $3 at JR's. Heheheh. Tick this one up to trying any untasted beer:  Bleah (An interjection to expresses negative feelings. The quality of the emotion bleah is expressed as more negative than that of blah and has a slight feeling of disgust, verging on nausea.)\n",

The nose is malty and buttery, some sourdough, not especially enticing.  Things get worse.  Flavors of cardboard, stale bread, hay, butter are wince-inducing.  Some caramely malt is in the background but it can't save an otherwise unenjoyable beer.  Light-medium in weight, medium in carbonation, reasonably dry, finishing stale and flat.  Overall, not much else to say.  This just isn't very good and not worth drinking more than necessary to get my review completed.\n",

      "I was pleased to support a new local brewery. This is probably a fine beer for those who KNEW they were choosing a 50 IBU Sour. Maybe that's normal for a \"Norwegian Farmhouse IPA\" and I should have known that. But the can has room for \"50 IBU Sour\" even among all that cool artwork. For me, this tasted like a Radler or a shandy. NOT what I wanted in December.\n",
      "Bottle care of Al, pours a brown color with small head. Notes are Acetone, vinegar, butter, and more drain pour acid. Al has been trying to open this for 4-5 tastings, but we were always scared. 12.5 percent lol? Mega Woof!\n",
      "50cl. Smooth grainy beginning with fruity to sour lemonade in the back. Easy to drink, grainy with sweetish lemonade in the end. Easy to drink, but the artificial sweeteners are way too artificial and destroying the nice fruity picture. \n",
      "Very sad...\n",
      "Bitter-metallerner Beginn, der an Discounter-Ware erinnert. Geringe Würzigkeit, wässriger Hintergrund, trocken. So gar nicht gelungen... 8/6/7/6/7/6\n",
      "Amber color with meidum white head. caramel, DMS, strange sourness in aroma. Taste, caramael, harsh bitterness, oxidation, DMS, acetaldehyde.\n",
      "Bottle. Deep amber color with thick white head. Aroma of caramel malt, metallic, lightstruck,  DMS. Taste, the same.\n",
      "Clear pale with no noticiable IPA nose. Big bitter rude ass terribly on style beer. Like IPA? Put this on yer bucket list. This is as mouth coating nasty nellie IPA as you can find. Yes, terribly on style, ignore my numbers, not a fan of this style but its dead on.\n",
      "An imperial stout with only 22 IBU? What is that. Black nitro pour also not entirely my thing. Has that obvious creamy nitro head. So despite the low hopping rate, this is very bitter. I think most of it is coming from some strong black malt. Strongly roasted black flavors and a lot of licorice. A ton of licorice, bitter and herbal similar to jagermeister mixed with imperial stout. Could not even finish the small flight pour.\n",
      "Bottle (screwcap!)picked up from Bayerisches Bierspezialitäten Pararadies Bienenfleiß and consumed at home Attenkirchen Sunday 1st December 2019 cooking a Beef Rendang and listening to one of our 🎸🎶 albums of 2019 🎸🎶  Modern Nature - How to Live. I have to say that despite looking pretty good (light amber with a white head, excellent clarity) it is poor in every other category. It's flat, a little sweet and with a bit of malt but its really poor, drainpour for me.\n",

      "Silo can. Deep brass body with only a few traces of a head. Nose of grainy corn and abc gum. There is just the faintest whiff of perfume. The taste is sweet corn flakes with a hint of bologna. Surprisingly it's not very harsh, just sweet. An acceptable high abv malt liquor.\n",
      "I’m not sure anyone asked for this beer, and I’ll probably never go back. Not offensive, which is all I really hoped for. Light and a little bitter, mostly grass and pine. Lingering bitterness.\n",

      "I bought a 4 pack of this beer and I honestly don't think I can finish it. There's something really off putting about the extremely tart, sour, overly flavored taste of this beer. I feel like I'm drinking cold dish water that someone threw a bunch of fruit rinds and other herbs and spices into with every sip. I choked my way through the first can and honestly had to just toss the last few bits of the 2nd and 3rd can bc it's just too much of a chore to drink. I'm looking at the 4th can and thinking, \"well maybe one day all the stores around me will be closed and I won't be able to buy any beer.\" Any port in a storm kind of beer. This really made me contemplate my relationship to alcohol. It's honestly that bad in my opinion. I'm giving it points only for the can design and it does have a nice cloudy appearance.\n",

      "I have been drinking Bud light 4 years.  Now I really want 2 find a different beer. Earlier this year I called a complained a few times about the beer being flat. They were very nice. They reimbursed me.  Well, it's been HAPPENING AGAIN. I always buy the 20 pack bottles. The majority of them r flat. I am on Social Security so I dont have a lot money. Most of my extra money goes on Bud light.  I collect all things Bud light. I have thousands of Bud light bottle caps. There's just something about a nice fresh cold beer when u (Or supposed 2 hear) that sound when u open the bottle. Then comes the disappointment when there's no sound. I would say it's been the last 13 20 packs where the majority r flat and that doesn't include the 1's I complained about earlier in the year. I asked them if they have other people complaining about the same issue. They said no one. That was a lie. There r hundreds complaining about the beer being flat.\n",

      "Pours a clear, dark red without a head.  The aroma is intense, but not in a good way.  Smoke, peat, and extremely heavy scotch, all of which brings to mind the smell of one of those thick permanent markers.  The taste is moderately sweet with the flavors being pretty well balanced.  Smoke, peat, cherry, fig, oak, and scotch, with the scotch lingering through into the finish.  Light to medium in body and a little more thin in texture.  You are also left with a mild alcohol burn.  I don't like scotch so I'm probably biased.  If you fight past the initial impression the aroma offers, this one is drinkable.  But it isn't good.\n",

      "Hahah, it said lunx on the beer menu! Slight off aroma like BO from the tap. Nose carries over to the diesel taste. First I think this is just an APA but the sharp IPA bitter bite evolves and becomes almost excruciating towards the end. Even so, its on the lower end of IPA or the upper end of APA. Just another one of a trillion ubiquitous IPA that all taste about the same. Whatever, how boring.\n",

This cyder is perfect if you have an underdeveloped tastebuds. That was one of the problems Rosie probably saw in me. 340ml can, no idea of the colour due to the opaque nature of the tin can.

      "Hahah, name on this $2 bottle makes me want to pop it and chug it. Well, here goes. One big giant chug from this 60F bottle is decent. Poured rest into a mug. A fancy mug yet it has a clear side for viewing. Some off aroma in the nose. Quite a blast. Pretty good carbonation with some ill ale effects but it never tries to be an IPA and I'm glad about that. Next to tap, a craft beer is so much better in a bottle, forget the cans mahfah. Not too bad overall beer tasting experience thank you columbus. Yes, an aye pee aye I can tolerate. Dude.\n",
      "Danke an rauchbierlover. Getreidiger, trocken hefiger Beginn, Saison-artig, eher muffig. Herb, sehr trocken, quasi kein Hopfen. Hefig-bitterer Abgang. 8/7/6/6/8/6\n",
      "Can. Pours a hazy golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma of lemon, pink grapefruit, some orange then washing up liquid. Taste of washing up liquid and chemicals. Light bodied and moderate carbonation. A dry, astringent, washing up liquid finish. Took one mouthful then quickly rated then. Foul! Drain pour.\n",
      "21/11/2019. Bottle, sample, courtesy of danlo, cheers Ed! Pours clear pale gold with a short lasting off-white head. Aroma of sweet malt, lime, lemon and a touch of ginger. Quite heavy sweetness, minimal bitterness. Light body, slight sticky texture, soft carbonation. Sweet finish.\n",
      "21/11/2019. Bottle, sample, courtesy of danlo, cheers Ed! Pours clear pale gold with a small fizzed off-white head. Aroma of sweet peach, not too artificial. Medium plus sweetness, minimal bitterness. Light body, slight sticky texture, average carbonation. A bit more real than the apple version.\n",
      "21/11/2019. Bottle, sample, courtesy of danlo, cheers Ed! Pours clear very pale gold with a short lasting white head. Aroma of grain, grass and vague sweet apple juice. Quite heavy boiled sweet sweetness, minimal bitterness. Light body, watery texture, average carbonation. Not much point to this.\n",

      "Draft at the brewpub.  Dark brown, muddy even.  Drinks with an earthy musk, almost caramel and nutty.  M'eh.  Wouldn't go back.  (#7607, 11/2019)\n",
      "First of all...I'm Venezuelan and I've been drinking this all my life.....this is shit, taste like piss water, I rather drink Budweiser, Coors or other American beer flavoured water. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Color amarillo pálido, cristalina. Dos dedos de espuma con retención media. Aroma a casi nada, ligero cereal. Gusto a casi nada, un poco de cereal, notas dulces y de cartón. Cuerpo acuoso. Cerveza light, aguada, sin nada a destacar, sin gluten.\n",
      "Der Geruch verspricht nicht viel. Und siehe da. Der Antrunk ist widerlich wässrig und billig malzig. Eines von den ganz schlechten alkoholfreien.\n",
      "Pours golden with tracing carbonation. Thin white head. Aroma of yeast and sweet malt. Taste has light floral notes, sweet malt. Palate has light bread notes, sweetness. Eh.\n",
      "Guava overpowers the nose.  Pale, misty, moderately sour, not sweet. Guava is too stiff all round. Light body, slightly saline maybe. Flat. On tap, Cannon Brewpub, Columbus, GA with LuckyDog.\n",
      "From cask at Cardinal with BHK after seeing The Lobster at Lanternen filmklubb 19.11.19. Served by gravity. Translucent straw colour. Not head or lacing. Some aroma and taste of American hops and old citrus. Harsh citrus and pine bitterness is lingering on. Very flat, even by cask standard\n",
      "\"Karlsberg Starkes Bock\", 6,6 %, Fläschchen von Getränke Hoffmann, Berlin. - Kastanienrot, klar. - In der Nase recht süßes dunkles Malz, leicht säuerlich-herbe Schokolade, strenge Hintergrundherbe. - Antrunk ruppig dunkelmalzig und grell süßsäuerlich-bitterschokoladig mit schroffer krautiger Herbe. Milder rezent, vollmundig, hart im Mund. Im Abgang derb malzbitter mit ranziger Herbe und Anklängen an Möbelpolitur. - Unglaublich derber, unausgereifter Bock, eine echte Zumutung für den Gaumen. Daß die Karlsberg-Brauer sich nicht schämen, etwas derart Unfertiges in Umlauf zu bringen ... (19.11.2019.)\n",
      "On tap at the brewpub, Clear golden with small head. Notes are granny smith apple and infection. One sip and didn't touch this taster again. Awful and shouldn't have been sold\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2012. Lightly hazy golden with a thin white head. Aroma of apples, straw and wet grass. Flavour is malty, with some fruity notes and wack of boiled sweets.\n",
      "Dunkler, leicht süß-säuerlicher Beginn, mildes Malz. Die Säure ist unpassend, das dunkle Malz wird dadurch weitestgehend verdrängt. Meh. 8/5/6/5/9/5\n",

Mouthfeel like a freshly melted candle. They threw in everything but the kitchen sink and it ruined it. Like trying to drink 5 tropical drinks at once. It doesn't work.\n",

      "pale yellow colour, minimal head, which disappears quickly; aroma and taste of cardboard, metallic and sourish-acidic notes; almost horrible...\n",
      "Bottle from AH. Pale golden with some bubbles. Sweet applejuice, winegums, light sickly fruit tea with tons of sugar, fake chemical aromas, hollow, soulless bombastic sweetness. Quite sweet, light bitter. Medium body and soft carbonation. Sugary mouthfeel, pointless, alcoholic soda pop.\n",
      "Bottle, 500 ml. Clear golden, short lasting white head. Stinks a bit. Malty, sweetish, metallic. Light bodied, quite bland.\n",
      "Very pungent aroma, and very fruity to the taste. My disclaimer is I am not a big Cranberry fan, but this was overkill and partly sour\n",
      "I have tried this beer on three different occasions and each time it immediately foams up to the point of aggravation. it is so annoying that i will not endure its fairly good flavor to suffer the indignities of this foaming menace when there are so may other beers that rise to the same flavor level and can actually be drunk within the first ten minutes of pouring it, and forget about trying to drink it straight from a bottle. That is mission impossible>\n",
      "Ap at brewery. Copper pour, sparse head. Malty aroma, raisins. Light sweet taste, more raisins. 3.6% mild light but full\n",
      "Draft at the brewpub.  Yep, it's hazy and yellow.  Boring.  This one is particularly boring ... little aroma, no really descriptive flavors to share here ... no burn (for an \"imperial\") ... clean and without fault, but just flat. \n",
      " Boo.  (#7604, 11/2019)\n",
      "Ok, that was bad. That was just a bad lemonade. At least it was refreshing.\n",
      "Bottle from vintage. Aroma is a little off IPA. Taste, well, what do you expect? Just another rude ass APA that wants to be IPA. There are so many IPA out there, they've taken the place of the cheap american pale lager for the ubiquitous cheap american beer. There must be a brahzillion of them out there. What else can be said?\n",
      "Got as a gift 6-pack. Sour, thin, over-carbonated. Has an “enjoy by” scale but nothing indicated. Committed sacrilege: after three sips I poured the rest out. Maybe I’ll use the others to cook brats.\n",
      "I'm shocked.  This is one of the worst beers I've ever tried.  It tastes like beer with a good dose of jalapeno and onion with beer.  Who thought this would be a good idea???  Mole?? I tasted no mole at all.  Keep the chips and salsa on the side boys not in my drink!\n",
      "Cloudy beer. When poured it is not 355 ml. Approx 330ml in the cans. Taste is ok .\n",
      "Gawno. Pucha wygląda dramatycznie, tandetnie, jakieś napisy w języku suahili Xd, podejrzewam, że podobnie smakują piwa w Afryce. Zapach to słodki spirol, bulion warzywny. Smak nijaki, trochę od siebie odrzucają słodkawe nuty, pewnie jakichś tanich słodów. Pils z zerową goryczką... Nie polecam, shieeet.\n",

      "330ml bottle. Pale golden colour, thin white foam head and aroma of malt, lemon-lime. Taste is sweet, malt, grain, sugary, lemon-lime flavouring, with some wet-cardboardy bitterness. Thin syrupy mouthfeel, medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry papery finish. Very bland and soda-like\n",

Very sweet flavoured.\n",

Taste is malty, grains, straw, sweet juicy apple flavouring, with some cardboardy bitterness. Thin mouthfeel, medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry papery finish. Very bland, with just a short burst of the apple flavouring.\n",

      "The beer has got a  clear golden color with a small head and thin body.  Aroma of hops and citrus. Taste of hops,  citrus, bread. Metallic hints.\n",
      "Bottled. Cloudy yellow colour, medium persisten twhite head. Perfumy citrussy nose with some yeasty and bready tone. Taste of a bit sour wheatbeer and a lot of unpleasant artificial lemon with some spice. Medium body, chewy texture, sharp carbonation, sweet and fruity finish. I dont like it.\n",

      "On tap @ Főzdefeszt. Dark amber colour with small and disappearing bubbly off-white head. Malty nose with some vegetables. Taste of an average mass produced lager with unpleasant heat. No chilli or paprika taste, just the heat in the throat. Crap.\n",
      "Bottled. Clear amber colour with medium sized off-white head, fair retention. Shy aromas with some hay and caramel. Taste of sourdough, honey and some fruity hops. Light body, thin mouthfeel, dry and a bit empty finish. Good thirst quencher, but nothing special.\n",
      "Cask at The Oddfellows, Watford in 2011. Clear copper with a white head. This was never a good beer, even in the days when people didn’t widely know (and if we go back long enough, that would even include myself) that this definitely ain’t no IPA of any variety. Aroma of malty, with a hint of floral hops and a plastic note. Pretty bland. Not totally undrinkable, but likewise not worth drinking either.\n",
      "\"Bold, juicy Oregon peaches play with a blend of tart Northwest-grown berries for a cider full of sunshine to drink on those grey Portland days. Lively raspberries & blackberries burst onto your tongue, just like plucking the fruit from your own backyard. 5.2% ABV\".\n",

      "$2 can is only 3.8% ABV, hahahah. Slight haze on pale. Oh, way too much cloying sugar, totally hides the tart radler effects. Difficult. Rudish brutish brawtverst. Not easy to get along with. Was nervous about this and now I see why. Coats the sides of yer mouth. Whew. I never thought a radler should taste like this but what-ever. So there you have it and here it is.\n",

      "tastes like a belgian white was diluted 50/50 with a coors. sweet smelling cheap wheat and corn with old orange peels or orange flavoring. flavor is the same - sweet brew of cheap wheat and corn with weird orange flavor - not getting nice yeasty funk or spice or anything youd expect from a good white ale. cloying orange flavor and stale grain aftertaste - will avoid...\n",

      "Surprised I haven’t rated this. This was a 2016 bottle shared by pat. Brown color with medium to full head. Notes are plastic, dentist office, latex, and other infection. Foodery should be ashamed they sold this to my friend\n",
      "Keg, third at Swindon's 33rd Annual Beer Festival. Shared with Finn. Pearl white head, clear golden body, dotted spots on the glass. Vague smell of pale malts, dry. Perfumed pale malty taste, hints of cardboard to the ending. About drinkable.  (26.10.2019).\n",
      "Awful beer, tastes metallic. I dare not speculate what they add to get such a bitter taste. couldn't drink more than a little. Doesn't complement anything as far as I am concerned.\n",
      "I like sours, I really do. But I just can't get on board with this, because it isn't just tart, it's more like \"I think the vinegar bottle leaked I to my beer\" sour. There is some fruit in there, but it's just overwhelmed by an aserbic mouthful. Sorry. Nope.\n",
      "tastes like a slightly improved version of a discount canadian lager like laker. very limited use of hops, not really clear what variety at all, it says local hops. taste lacks malt character or bitterness. it really just tastes like a 5% malt liquor style discount beer but without the adjunct harshness. complete garbage for 3.25 a tallboy\n",
      "This just tastes funny. Sort of a watery, kinda minty, something-is-off flavor, kinda like sour milk. I don't know if it's because my palate is wrecked from just drinking a different beer (an inoffensive if not particularly good brown ale), or if I'm using the wrong glassware (teku glasses aren't the best for stouts), or what. Not the glassware, poured it into a dimpled mug and I'm getting the same thing. Maybe there's something wrong with this one, but from what I can tell, this is a bad beer.\n",
      "Was on offer in the local so tried it. This isn’t a good beer. No depth, it’s over sweet not tropical. So disappointed, it’s like an artificially flavoured cheap lager!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry but I bought 4 of these and be nothing else to drink!\n",
      "Bottle on clearance at bowsers, cheap. Cloudy pale, aroma of some kindah spice. Odd weird unique spice thang on teh uptake, but not real bitter. Yes, quite unique, almost like trying to like medicine. Whew. Difficult. A little too different I'd say. Whew. Perhaps just a tad of warming sensations from the ginger. Not sure about any lime tho. Would not repeat, repeat, would not repeat, heheheh.\n",
      "Thin bodied, almost no foam or head, zero lacing and only a hint of the characteristics of what is typically a rich and full-bodied style. Add to this the unfriendly service at their South Burlington, VT 'taproom' in the brewery, and I recommend you avoid this one.\n",
      "Clear pale with no head.\n",
      "Smell of lemon. Lemonade at the attack, in the middle of the sip hoppy bitterness and then a malty ending. A sweetener overlay during the whole sip. Medium carbonation.\n",

      "Keg at We Brought Beer, Balham.  Hazy straw with a white head.  Aroma of wet grass, some over-ripe fruit and that wet dog note.  Flavour is very sweet and caramelly, and I’m getting quite a note of skunked hops on this.  Not sure if that’s deliberately to make the beer sweeter.  However, it seems Wild might be missing the point of NEIPAs and their sweetness.  Flavour is again sweet, before there’s a rush of slightly metallic bitterness, followed by a lingering flavour, not unlike that which you might get after rapidly consuming a whole tube of fruit pastilles.\n",

      "Clear golden colour, small white head. Grainy, metallic aroma. Light-bodied. Sweet, low bitterness, apple and metal. Weak industrial Helles.\n",
      "Tap bowser's, nice place. Slight haze on pale, not really a NE IPA, its just a little hazy. Sweet BO aroma, like your mate after sex. Reminds me of diesel. Bitter hop beer. Mouth coating almost astringent blast. What up with these bitter bastard big IPA styles? Straight up terribly on style IPA ass. Rude, IPA is simply rude. There, you have it. IPAWTF!\n",
      "Color amarillo claro, sin turbiedad, transparente. Espuma blanca, irregular, de dos dedos de espesor y corta retención. Aroma escasísimo a cereal y maíz, rancio, con notas a jabón. Sabor igual, sensación metálica al atemperar, final corto, ligeramente dulce, sin amargor, alcohol imperceptible. Textura acuosa. Carbonatación media baja.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un día de estos nos vamos a hacer daño probando cualquier basura de estas que se nos cruzan por delante.\n",
      "Tap at meadows tap room. Clear pale with a clean IPA nose, no BO. Initial big beefy brutal bitter hop attack on the palate. Large and in charge. Evolves into a perfectly IPA hop bitter bite. Not as viscous as most double IPA but quite an impact none the less. More like a regular IPA if you ask me. Yes, the taste is terribly on stle and maybe a little more fresh than most IPA.\n",
      "Slavena-Lux 14 lei - 0.5 l\n",
      "Renumitul Lager BUD produs si de  SUN InBev Ukraine dezamăgeşte toate aşteptările.Şi doar preţul mic face să o serveşti o dată pentru a nu te mai întoarce la ea.\n",
      "Wässrig pappiges Bier mit stumpf herber, leichter Bitterkeit. Eines der schlechteren.\n",
      "33cl bottle. A clear yellow golden beer with a white head. Aroma of fresh sweet grainy malt, citrus. Taste of sweet citrus lemonade, sugar, no beer....\n",
      "Pours up a hazy piss yellow in the glass with a frothy white head. Aroma has some yeasty funk and a nasty chemical that has plagued every beer to come out of this place. Taste is yeasty with some funk and then the wave of bad water and bad brewing hit you like a succor punch. It's almost drinkable for a second, then it's time to take your caster oil. Just nasty.\n",
      "Pours up a black color in the glass, with an off white head. Hoppy chemical aroma. Taste like cooked garbage. Old rotten vegetables and a nasty chemical with some bandaids thrown in. If Dr. Jekyll wasn't bad enough here is his partner sure to have you barfing on the dead plants out front. Just aweful.\n",
      "Pours up a cloudy hazy gold color in the glass with a white head on top. Coffee aroma. Taste has lots of coffee up front and a nasty chemical presence on the finish. Like bad water. Medicinal. Gave me a monster headache for a day. Just in time for Halloween, and just bad.\n",
      "12oz can, variant of the usual PBR. Walmart. From the sublime to the ridiculous over the course of the past two days. Clear, pale yellow.  Tall head, somewhat sticky on the glass. Inert aroma - nearly non-existent, maybe a little powdery.  Zero bitterness - there's a faint astringency on the sides of the tongue, but that's not bittering.  This is just malt liquor or cream ale - without looking, I'm betting my 8-ball rating is higher.  Stick with the usual PBR, or get Busch Ice or something. #Odell #FSUvBC.\n",
      "Boring yellow and okay bleach white foam, soft rotting cabbage on the nose. Flavour is weak pilsner hops, some sugar, all not bound together by a watery mouthfeel. Rather boring and low rent, but luckily not disgusting.\n",
      "Stark alkoholischer, säuerlich malzgier Beginn. Intensiv, brennend, spritig, viel Malz. Langer alkoholischer Abgang. 10/5/5/6/10/5\n",

      "Very flat and tasteless. Taste was like a watered down cold cup of coffee (and yes I have tried that before) dark brown/black body with no head at all, smells of coffee. Honestly think it was a cold pint of coffee at three times the price. £4.80 on tap at head of steam in Nottingham. Been to this pub lots of times and beers are always good so I don't think it's their fault, just a poor beer.\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2015. Clear chestnut, with no head. Really quite flat, with very little carbonation. Not sure if the seal of the crown top wasn’t compromised. Aroma of Diasytal, nuts, and sweets. Toffee flavour, with bread and a copper note. Finish was Sugary water, earth, and metallic hints.\n",
      "50cl bottle. A slightly hazy pale yellow colour. Aroma of fresh moderate sweet citrus lemonade. Taste of citrus lemonade, grapefruit, no beer.\n",

Quite sweet, slightly sourish, gently fruity and a little artificial taste of lemonade and traces of grains, followed by a short, slightly tart finish. Thin body, gently effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Average Radler.\n",
      "Süßer künstlicher Beginn, Brauselimonade. Zitrone (süß), monoton. Okay, mir zu süß. 8/6/6/6/5/6\n",
      "Half-pint, cask ale, shared with Finn at Queen Inn. Dotted spots on the nose, filmy layer, cloudy golden body. Spiced fruity aromas. Fruity taste with ginger and rosemary spices. Perfumed fruity end. Sorry, not my kind of beer.  (Winchester 23.10.2019).\n",
      "Sampled from 0.33 l bottle, best before June 2021. Almost clear, pale golden with a white head. Sweetish, gently fruity and slightly artificial aroma of pineapple juice and some lemonade. Gently sweet, slightly bitter, rather artificial and quite fruity taste of pineapple juice and some lemonade, followed by a short, slightly bitter finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Not great.\n",

Thin to medium body, minimally astringent and gently effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Nope.\n",

Very sweet, highly artificial, moderately fruity taste of gummy bear and some mango, followed by a short, slightly bitter finish.

      "Clear tepid yellow and a very artificial looking fast disappearing bleach white head, this smells like overly sweetened bread and not in a good way. Flavour is sharp bread notes, hints of burning plastic and vague licorice dropped in dirt. Rather offensive, surprisingly and I thought they'd go the boring bland route with their light beer.\n",
      "Very pale yellow body and really thin foam, smells like sweaty socks left out to dry by the beach in the hot sun here. Flavour is like those same sweaty socks steeped in hot water and then mixed with sugar. Especially bad, even for a macro lager.\n",
      "Künstlicher, sehr süßer Beginn von Kaugummi mit Bananengeschmack. Sehr süß bleibend, dann trocken, minimal herb. Bäh. 7/5/5/5/4/5\n",
      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford in 2014. Gold, with a dense white head. Aroma of Sweet caramel, toffee, and biscuits. Custard creams, and banana essence in the flavour, with a little dry straw. Finish was Sickly sweet, with candies, and over ripe fruit notes.\n",

      "I mean, technically drinkable. I usually only grab it when my options are limited to Bud, Miller, and whatever random ipa the stadium has. There is almost always a better option.\n",
      "12 oz. can. Pours a crystal clear light gold color with a small white head and fair retention. Spotty lacing. Sour grain aroma. Sour grain flavor to match the nose. Crisp mouthfeel with a medium-light body. If the fix the sour grain flavor this would be a decent cheap lager, but... Their light lager is slightly better.\n",
      "500ml Bottle from Aldi, Wrekenton, Gateshead. Dutch Spanish-style beer? Pale golden coloured with a thick white head. It has a pale golden colour with a thick white head. It has a malty, grassy and corn flavour with a thin warming soapy finish. Poor.\n",

      "Golden-amber colour, small white head. From looks you can already say: no, this is not a stout. Aroma is .. potatoes, yes. Light-bodied, feels 5% beers. Some sweetness, coffee, vanilla and potatoes. This is real crap from Left Hand.\n",
      "Aroma is strong chemical.\n",

      "Im Glas honiggelbes Ale mit weißem Schaum. In der Nase Stroh, etwas Malz und Hopfen. Im Mund fruchtig-bitterer Antrunk, der ins metallische umschlägt, gerstiger Abgang mit metallisch-bitterem Nachgeschmack.\n",
      "Without doubt the worst beer I have tasted.The taste is not pleasant,very sickly, couldn’t finish one small bottle.If it was possible to score Zero I would have.\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2015. Clear copper with a thin offwhite head. Clear force carbonation. Aroma of plastic, malt extract and some grassy hops. Flavour is very fake and has that weird plastic, mineral note that most GK bottled beers have. Unpleasant.\n",
      "330ml bottle in 2015. Clear Amber, with a tiny white head. Aroma of Malt, boiled sweets, and fake orange. Aggressive CO2 (which is listed as an ingredient - honest, I suppose). Barley sugar flavour, with some menthol, and stewed tea notes. Finish was bitter Resin, peal and biscuity malt.\n",
      "Perfectly clear golden coloured body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall pure white head Aroma of nasty, super funky corn, sugar, millet and off-grains with a light yeat bite, some yeast and bready notes, but a non-existing and slightly nasty funk noticeable immediately when the nose is put up to the glass. Light-bodied; Strong funky corn and fake-malt notes with a lot of bread, yeast, fake sugar and stale funk noticeable throughout, with nothing enjoyable to catch and hold onto - this is purely off-putting flavours with a dash of yeast and bready qualities with some earthy and nut finishes that give it at least something else than the fake flavours. Aftertaste is dry, herbal and very funky throughout with a lot of nutty and earthy flavours, but the fake sugars and especially fake malts dominate in a bad and unsettling way. Overall, a very poor 'beer', but I suppose if you pretend to have some issues with handling glutens, this would be some alcohol; however, if you are in that category and pretend that you can't handle them, then just settle for something non-beer, please. I sampled this sixteen ounce, pint-sized can, purchased fby my wife by accident, after running a marathon (USMC Marathon 2019) at home in Washington on 27-October-2019 for US$2,99 at Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia a few hours earlier, sampled at home in Washington on 06-November-2019 after forcing myself to get rid of this crap.\n",
      "Can to mug. Pours piss yellow, forced carbonation. Somewhat off cereal on the nose, metallic. Has a funny buttery flavor more than anything else. Goes down smooth. Possibly the cheapest beer in my market. 43 cents later, I'm refreshed and a little buzzed. Mission accomplished.\n",
      "12 ounce with no bottling date. Mostly clear, orange-copper pour with a lasting disc of spongy foam. Nose is rubber with maybe a hint of toast. Flavor starts out the same and improves slightly to charred popcorn and resin. Decent balance, near-medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation are the nicest things I can say about this beer. Bathtub pour; hoping it will help unclog any hair balls.\n",

      "\"Sophienhofer Pils\", 1-l-Flasche aus dem \"Erlebnis Braugasthof\" Brauner Hirsch, 3 Tage nach Erwerb konsumiert. - Goldbraun, leicht trüb. - In der Nase karamelliges helles Malz, vor allem aber aufdringliche ranzige Noten (Hefe?). - Auch im Geschmack dominiert eine scharfe hefig-ranzige Bittere, welche die auch vorhandene karamellig-füllige Malzigkeit und die grasige Hopfenherbe brutal unterdrückt und keine Freude aufkommen läßt. Milder rezent, vollmundig. Im Abgang kühlende Minze vor beträchtlicher grasig-hopfenwürziger Herbe. Übel ranziger Nachtrunk. - Was ein durchaus trinkbares Landbier (allerdings definitiv kein Pils, dafür ist es zu plump) sein könnte, wird durch derbe ranzige Hefebittere völlig ruiniert. Nein, so geht es nicht, liebe Sophienhofer Brauer. Wenn Euer Bier schneller umkippt als der Kunde es nach Hause tragen kann, habt Ihr ein Hygieneproblem. (6.11.2019.)\n",

      "I bought it at jumbo (0,5) for 3 euro. I think it is extremely overpriced for this product. Tastes like Red Bull with fruit taste. Nothing even close to the taste of cider. Very chemical color, smell and taste. In short - disgusting.\n",

Pretty nasty white cider taste, and very nasty finish. Not getting much ethanol here, but perhaps some of the nastiness is fusels. Not as bad as my homeys make it out to be.\n",

Light cereal, herbal note, water. Light sweet, medium dry SHORT refreshing, bitter note. Light body, thin oily texture, soft gaseous, no finish. Overall, poor. Very drinkable.\n",
      "330ml bottle in 2015. I think someone bought me this as a gift, thinking it was a decent craft beer. Someone who doesn’t really drink beer... the clear bottle is an obvious indication of the quality within. Pours a clear mid golden. Aroma is incredibly sweet, with lots of sugar, vanilla and as if someone poured one of those coffee syrups into a bland lager. Flavour is likewise super sweet. Couldn’t drink much.

      "Pours clear, pale golden with a one finger white head.  Aroma is light corn and grass.  Taste is corn syrup, moving to grass and faint hops. Finish is corn.\n",
      "Packaged on 18 September 19. The Aromas are hops, fruit, wet grain and solvents. Flavors are a little like nose, quite sweet up front along with some powerful solvents and a little bitter in The Finish. Rough drinking. One of the very few disappointments from Anchorage. Going to have a hard time finishing this.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle.  Pours light yellow with little foam.  The aroma is very neutral and the flavor is very light.  No mistakes here, but certainly not worth the premium price and not as good as a High Life which is setting the bar pretty low.\n",
      "Clear red with a frothy head.\n",
      "Smell of cherry and redcurrant. Tasting like someone overdosed the syrup in a drink and added alcohol. An unpeasant bitter acidity at the end of the sip. Medium carbonation.\n",
      "Cask at The People’s Park Tavern, Homerton In 2015. Murky deep golden with a thin white head. Aroma of damp grass, woody notes and not really that Sorachi note. Pretty bland, with some wet grass notes.\n",
      "Draft at the brewery. Brown body, small beige head. The aroma has coffee. The taste is very strong of coffee too.\n",
      "Draft at the brewery. Amber body, almost no head. Looks like iced tea. The aroma has ice tea too, with plenty of apricot. The taste is a bit overwhelming, too bitter yet too fruity.\n",
      "Can't tell the difference to most other non-alcoholic beers from big names brewers. Slightly watery, not too much taste, but drinkable.\n",
      "zapach bardzo lekki, trochę zielonej butelki, trochę skórki z jabłek, jakiś kurz, woda spod warzyw i słody. wszystkiego trzeba się doszukiwać. kolor bardzo jasny, słoty, słomkowy, klarowny, piana biała, średnio obfita i krótka. w smaku wytrawne, wodniste, bardzo lekkie zbożowe nuty, odrobina kurzu i zielonej butelki, kukurydza. nie jest niedobre, ale nie ma smaku praktycznie. goryczka bardzo niska, kukurydziana i liściasta. w ustach gazowana woda. nasycenie wysokie.\n",
      "On tap at the brewpub. Slight haze on pale. A little uncivilized for a lager on the uptake; I hope they don't tell unsuspecting customers this is like the pale lagers of american yore. There is a fresh BK brewer pointed astringent feeling in this one.  This band-aid attribute mows over any smooth friendly gentleman lager initiative that may be present. Perhaps that is what it's s'posed to do? Just asking.\n",
      "740ml can (TCrBF2018) (1:1:2:1:3=0.8)\n",
      "Scary blue. Fake sugary sweetener aroma, obnoxious maybe like an energy drink, just chemicals. Taste is the same, chemical-infested fizzy sugar-water. What other people with less sophisticated palates are unable to discern is that there's just a touch of okra in the taste too - nice twist, mister natty!\n",
      "Diacetyl. Greyish brown colour, clearly oxidized. Mouthfeel is decent. Terrible batch; this is clearly a question of poor quality control. What’s up with this one? —————\n",
      "Drinkable lager but not as good as I'd hoped. A bit grainy and harsh.  Otherwise light, reasonable beer. Can from 5 Point Cafe in Seatte.\n",

      "Perhaps I wasn’t in the mood for what in my opinion, is the worst style of beer, or perhaps it is just a bad Kölsch, as I have had many that are far better.. but either way, this marks the second beer on Beer With Us that was not finished, and ultimately poured down the drain.\n",

      "Initial pour was milky light brown like a yoohoo, but as the rest of it came it was more like a traditional black stout.  Looked almost like chunks or hazies of hazelnut and chocolate floating, uncleared and unfermented.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  \n",

      "I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).  \n",

Taste has crisp doughy malt, faint citrusy hops, a grainy swallow, and a slightly minty herbal aftertaste.  The minerality is fairly high and dominates the flavor profile since everything else is fairly muted.\n",

      "Keg at Belleville Brewery, Wandsworth Common.  Cloudy ochre with a white head.  Nice idea, but just too much of everything.  The aroma is surprisingly light, with some fruity and mango notes.  The flavour is straight up ruined by the seasalt.  I think there’s some mango and I get a subtle chilli heat, which is nice.  But it’s like someone threw some brine in the mix.  I think a mango chilli lime IPA could have been nice, and possibly a tiny amount of salt might have added something, but this is just way too much.\n",
      "The aroma is weak nothingness. Like, these flavours should be burning my nose. They're not; that's a problem. There's weak weak foam on this and a boring yellow body. Flavour is weak something that I can't identify as mango nor habanero. Where is it? Were they simply just imagining them in here? Mouthfeel is nothingness, slightly watery, slightly nothing. There is absolutely nothing to like nor remember about this beer.\n",
      "Can @ Højbjerg tasting. Medium head with medium duration. Color is pale golden. Aroma and taste are sweet malt, bread, grain and little hops. Sweet malty finish.\n",
      "Soft cream on the nose, has weak yellow body with only a trace of foam. Flavour is weak cream and mealy hoppiness. Cloying aftertaste. Just all wrong for a beer, let alone a pilsner.\n",
      "Soft strawberry on the nose, has a muddy light orange body. The flavour is bitter strawberry and tin with a cloying aftertaste. Did they forget to clean their lines? This tastes terrible, like strawberries helping to rust a tin can. Missing any and all strawberry sweetness.\n",

I keep drinking ‘IPL’s recently with almost no discernible hop presence and massive malty sweetness.  Did someone change the goalposts on these, or are breweries just using the ‘IPL’ term and a meaningless selling device?\n",
      "..got 2 bottles, has alcohol alright, cant warm up to the taste, reminds me of soapy water what lingers... a lot tastier beers around Bochum and the Ruhr-valley.. great area to visit.... try Fiege Bernstein or Krombacher Hell (means bright) or Pils...\n",

      "Z moich wrażeń - klarowne, złociste, ładna piana z lejsingiem, puchowa nieomal. W aromacie - pustostan, w smaku słód i słód. I woda. Neutral 100%.\n",
      "Poured up on tap at Tipsy Cactus where it exhibits a hazy gold body that supports a thin white head of foam. The aroma offers up candy like tropical and citrus notes and little else. The taste delivers scittles like citrus and tropical fruit candy flavors. I get little else. Sad. Don't drink this.\n",
      "Clear pale golden. Vague taste and aroma. Boring and watery beer. Not worth the 75 characters\n",
      "A sweet beer with lot of caramel and vanilla flavour and smell.\n",

      "Tap. Pours clear yellow,  small white head,  some lacing.  Aroma is corn,  apple, hay, straw,  weird.  Flavor is light plus sweet,  light bitter. Offputting fruity notes.  Light body.  Bad 2,3,2,3,5\n",
      "Big ass can.  Cherry, lime, malt, and alcohol aroma.   Hazy ruby red with small, short-lasting head.   Moderately sweet cherry, lime, light malt, and mildly bitter alcohol and hay flavor.   Light body.   Like Robitussin Light.\n",
      "Pomegranate and light malt aroma. Hazy purple with minimal head.  Moderately sweet pomegranate, wheat malt, and mildly bitter hay flavor.    Okay body.\n",
      "Ever had a chocolate stout.. on weed? Not a fan of the overt dank effect in any beer, but here it's an abomination.\n",
      "Can. Golden, white head. Weed overwhelms on the nose, it's really all I get. Taste is some fruit mixed with the weed.Thin & sharp, a little astringent in the mouth. The dankness at least makes a little sense with this style, but it's still not a good beer.\n",
      "25 oz. can. Pours a thick, rapidly collapsing, white head, slight lacing, over a clear, dark yellow (SRM 4) body....nose is toasted malt, corn, light herbal hop tones, balanced.....taste is moderate malts, with slight sweet tones, corn, mild herbal notes, with very slight finishing hop bitterness.....mouth feel, medium light body, no alcohol, moderate carbonation. This is a very clean, quite simple beer that meets the Pale Lager light style. It is really uninteresting, although somewhat drinkable.\n",
      "Nasty nutsack sweat mixed with paint thinner and citrus rind. This crap is truly crapulent. Tons of Brettaroma and flavor for those who prefer their beers brewed within a goats behind. This is a cruel joke. I wish death upon the brewer's who probably sport neckbeards and eat only organic spalt bread.\n",

      "\n",
      "Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” \n",
      "\n",
      "On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. \n",
      "Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….\n",
      "Cask conditioned at Oxford Beer Festival '19, Oxford. Amber to gold with white head. Well this was the real marmite beer of this Festival, serving it people loved it or hated it, I have to say I was in the latter category. Cucumber tends to dominate everything else, indigestion inducing. Sorry, really not my thing.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at Oxford Beer Festival '19, Oxford. Muddy brown gold with white head. There was a slightly sludgy character to this with a chemical background. Phenolic notes. Difficult drinking unfortunately.\n",
      "440ml can from We Brought Beer, Balham.  Wow, I can see why the reviews for this have been so bad.  This has basically become a phantom of the London beer scene.  It’s so bad, you’ve just got to try it.  Smells like popcorn, weird savoury notes, soy sauce and burnt toast.  Medium body.  There’s fruitiness, but I could really place it as passionfruit... it’s horrible amount of wet rye bread, fennel, coriander and god knows what.  This is one of the worst beers I’ve ever had that has no fault.  It’s not badly made, it has no offtastes... it’s just bloody awful.  Everything you’ve heard is true.\n",
      "I’ve been drinking Batemans for the last 30 years. I don’t know what they’ve done to it in the last 6 months but the whole brewery is now undrinkable. Foul, nasty stuff. I don’t pour many bottles down the sink, but this one went. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great shame, as the old Victory was an accomplished traditional IPA easy drinking and heavy hitting. Malty, bitter, smooth. I have no idea why it’s changed.\n",
      "Aroma is nuts caramel turkish honey. Taste is intense sweet caramel and coke and spezi. Sweet finish. Good if you dont like beer.\n",
      "In three words...not a fan.  Cool bottle that's pours a nice lasting head with a copper body.  That's the good part.  I could not get past the highly alcohol taste.  It was just too much and I noted after I purchased it, it is 10.5% alcohol.  I tried it on several occasions and I basically poured the last of my 4-pack down the drain.  Yes, it was that bad.\n",
      "Big disappointment. If I had wanted anything as mercilessly bitter as that, I'd have bought an IPA or Pilsener. This completely lacks the sourness that defines Gose. Smells nice, tastes terrible.\n",
      "500ml can from Londis, Lytham St Anne. Amber gold colour, white foam head that dissipates away and aroma of tangy apple, sweaty socks, sick,  sulphur. Taste is sweet, apple flavouring, sugary with a fruity hint and sulphury notes. Medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry astringent finish with residual sweetness. Not the best\n",
      "Poor aroma of apples. In taste dry, little bit of apple flavour and little watery.\n",
      "Cask at The Coronet (JDW), Holloway in 2016. Hazy copper with a white head. Aroma of wet grass, malt and caramel. Wet grass and damp malt flavour with a bit of a metallic note at the end.\n",
      "500ml bottle at The Spice Lounge, Watford in 2016. Clear golden. Fairly malty aroma with a slight dried fruit note. Not a lot of flavour, but better than others of its ilk.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Gylden. Nesten klar. Filmskum. Mangoaroma. Parfymert. Smaken ille. Møllkuler. Ikke bra.\n",
      "Roze cider zonder schuim. De Cider smaakt mier zoet en iets naar rabarber. Daarnaast zat er iets romigs van de custard. Niet echt mijn ding dit, maar leuk om gehad te hebben.\n",
      "Si tratta di una birra a bassa fermentazione in stile Lager, che si presenta di colore giallo paglierino tenue, con cappello di schiuma non troppo persistente, a grana media. \n",
      "Aroma di malto, cereali, erbaceo, delicatamente amaro.\n",
      "Il gusto è molto leggero, anche se equilibrato tra malto e luppolo; si avverte mais. Il retrogusto è quasi assente.\n",
      "Si tratta di una birra dalla scarsissima carbonazione e dal corpo leggero, molto \"watery\".\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a lager style beer, with a pale yellow colour, with head of foam not so persistent, with medium grain. \n",
      "Aroma of malt, cereals, grassy, lightly bitter. \n",
      "Taste is so light, although balanced between malt and hops; corn taste is on the back. Aftertaste is almost missing. \n",

This proved to be a major doubt at this festival, was held back to see if it would improve then released rather unfortunately.

      "---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone\n",
      "Quite possibly the worst IPA I’ve had over the past 10yrs of nearly exclusively enjoying IPA’s.  This IPA was simply flat and sugary.  Highly NOT recommended as there are many top self IPA’s to enjoy here in Colorado.\n",
      "Absolutely abhorrent flavor. I wish I could tell you it was of a fruity nature- however there is so little malt flavor available as it's being robbed and murdered by what I can best characterize as a noxious cotton candy flavor and severe aftertaste. \n",
      "\n",
      "As another review mentioned, it's as bright as windex and stains your mouth, teeth, and likely your entire gastrointestinal tract all the way to the end- where you will be shitting blue for three days afterwords.\n",
      "Muddling dark brown body and little foam, smells softly of burnt molasses. Flavour is murky sharp barley with a watery finish. Just boring, fades into the background, makes you wonder why you drink beer.\n",
      "Clear yellow body and no foam, very soft floral hops on the nose. Flavour is weak floral hops and that's it- weak, watery and boring. ISA's don't have to be like this.\n",
      "Middling clear gold body and no foam, very vague lager hops on the nose. Flavour is what exactly - some lager and sweetness, no malt, nor hops really? Damn, I miss Space Jam. Bugs Bunny would never drink a beer like this.\n",
      "Clear yellow with no lasting foam, weak hop sweetness on the nose. Flavour is nothing, really - some weak hop grains and no pilsnery crispness. What is this? Why bother? At least The Legendary Pink Dots are playing tonight so this taster won't harsh my vibe.\n",
      "Bottle from my local grocery store in Queens, NYC. Light-colored medium, bubbly head that quickly fades. No lacing. Not at all hazy/cloudy as other reviewers mentioned. After the head fades, you could hand me a glass of this and tell me it's Mott's apple juice and I'd believe you.\n",

      "Dark clear ruby body and modest foam, sweet black currant on the nose. Flavour is bitter and tinny fruit without any grain character and a watery finish. Too weak to defend itself.\n",
      "Watery texture. Slight citrus flavour. Metallic mouldy aroma. Some hints of metallic flavour, not too much.\n",
      "I had to pour this beer into the sink because it was so gross. Thought this was a red beer, but it looks and tastes like a dark one. My disappointment Is immeasurable,and my day is ruined. The only reason I give 1 points to everything is that I can't give zero.\n",
      "Watery malts on the nose, has a weak copper body with vague foam. Flavour is muddy malt and chunky bread. Lingering sweetness. There is absolutely nothing interesting going on here.\n",
      "The aroma is malt but way too soft, has good foam on a soft caramelly body. Flavour is vague malt and grain of no distinction. The mouthfeel is weak and messy. It's all awkward, and there's no way this could be considered a bitter.\n",
      "When the lid was cracked, I almost barfed immediately. This has to be the worst smelling product that I've ever entered into RateBeer and that includes some pretty awful beers. If you have been to SouthEast Asia and you know the smell immediately when you enter a room (shop) that there is a cut up, WARM, durian lobe somwhere...this is that smell, somehow multiplied. Raw onions, rotting meat, funk, odd fruits and a spoiled pineapple on top of that mix - absolutely disgusting, and if I could give a negative aroma score, I absolutely would. The colour is pink, slightly violet and showing a faint off-white head that fades fast. Light-bodied; Strong fruit flavours show first with the stronger, meatier funk right behind with some durian notes, onion flavours and a dash of apples under those way more pungent notes. Aftertaste shows the funk and pungent meaty/umami notes that aren't good - just pure bad and nasty. Overall, if you can make it past the smell, the flavour is slightly better, but still insanely pungent and strong, in all the wrong ways. I absolutely love Graft ciders, but this was easily the worst drink I've had in a very long time, perhaps many years. I found it a challenge to make it through, and I did so almost as a joke, but I did NOT pour this out, that said, it was horrible to  make it through. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Liqour Outlet in Boonton, New Jersey on 23-June-2019 for US$3,69 sampled in my hotel room in Richmond, Virginia on 25-October-2019.\n",

      "Yes, can. Unlike the cask that I tried 4 years ago which I remember extremely well. (Actually I have no idea). This pours with a bleach white foam and medium gold body, with nothing but rotting grain on the nose.  The flavour is soft Hallowe'en candies, those chewy caramel types, and a fair bit of tin thrown in. Cloying sugariness. Wow, just.... I can't even, as the reddit incel moderators say. Just a pile of caramelly junk.\n",

      "Green color like paint.   Antiseptic aroma.  Chalky, sour, tart fruit flavor with a quick turn to a thick, funky finish.  Not good, feels clinging on your mouth.\n",
      "Delt med Rune på 22nd Oxford Beer & Cider Festival 2019. Ferskenfarget. 0 skum. Uklar. Aroma av ingefær og ihjelkokte grønnsaker. Smaken det samme. No good.\n",

      "zapach lekki, trochę słodów, jabłek i słodkiej kukurydzy. kolor jasnozłoty wpadający w słomkowy, klarowny, piana biała, średnio obfita średnio trwała. w smaku lekkie, wytrawne i wodniste, odrobina słodów, skórka od jabłka, liście z kukurydzy i kurz. goryczka niska, kurzowa. lekko suche w ustach. nasycenie umiarkowane do wysokiego\n",
      "Can, from Morrisons. Cloudy lemon gold, thin but moderately lasting white head and gentle condition. Big soapy citrus washing up liquid nose, some orange and grapefruit but mostly a strange soapiness, in the mouth it is harshly bitter and dry with more washing up liquid, a slight fruity orange note and a touch of sweet malt, finish is harsh and bitter with yet more soap. Quite foul but at least it left the glass sparkly clean.\n",
      "Can as pictured. Hops and hemp, I heard the plants are related. Yellow with a thick white head. Does have a bit of a skunky nose. Taste is big thick viscous venerable hops, terribly IPA hops. Lots of impact here. You know it, whew. Too much, way too much. Who can enjoy so many hop preservatives in a beer? Just asking. Rude straight up and away, gahhhh. Nasty nellifier.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Pale golden colour, white foamy head and aroma of malt, wet paper. Taste is sweetish malty, some grassy notes, cardboard, with light bitterness. Watery, light bodied, high spritzy carbonation, dry grassy papery finish. Quite a bland lager.\n",
      "330ml bottle in 2016. Hazy mid golden with a white head. Aroma of skunked hops, herbal notes and boiled sweets. Flavour is similar butterscotch and caramel hops that have turned.\n",

      "\n",
      "Second can, it improved a little, and was slightly easier to drink, a bit smoother and nicer on the old stomach, but still lacking any real depth to the beer. Malty and a little hoppy, but overall not a nice beer at all. Very forgetful and not worth trying again, cheap as it is and all………..\n",
      "This is me trying to beer I'm confident I'm not going to like. Purchased a 22oz bottle from my local Stater Brothers. Thick brown head on top of an opaque black body. It smells of peanut butter, with hints of milk and chocolate. This would be great if I like coffee, but I don't. Pretty much exactly what I'm not looking for in a beer. Honestly I feel like I wasted my six bucks.\n",
      "Pretty dry for my taste and much drier than other ones within the same terms of a stout. Literally woody taste and not smoothy as most of the people say! Very overrated, especially for a barrel aged stout!\n",
      "Gravicask på Twickenham Beer and Cider Festival 2019. Delt med Rune. Gusjemørkebrun/svart. 0 skum. Aroma av brent plast. Smaken litt sjokolade - men plastpreget henger i. Ikke helt bra.\n",
      "The youngest beer in Hinano’s range apparently, made for the 100th anniversary of the Tahiti brewery in 2014.  Thanks to tderoeck for sharing the can.  Mousy, egg-white, thick but unstable head, lightly hazy ‘old gold’ robe.  Rather weird aroma: bath foam and shampoo, sweet cereals, canned corn, rubber.  Sweetish-grainy onset, very slick, quite strong carb, metallic aspects, thin cereally body with that weird soapiness still lingering, ending a tad plastic- and iron-like with no hoppiness to speak of.  Even worse than the regular Hinano I had years ago, with that shampoo-like element making it even more ‘artificial’ than it already is - needless to say there is nothing rich nor subtle about it.\n",

      "20-10-19 // plastic bottle from local Aldi. Gebraut in Brauerei Braunschweig. Sweet radler. Not worth an indepth description.\n",
      "23/10/2019. Bottle at Ipswich Town v Rotherham (we lost and played poorly but that didn't influence this review as the beer was 'enjoyed' pre-match). The choice had been Carling, Bulmers or this. It wasn't my first taste of GK IPA from the bottle, but first for many years, and it will certainly be my last. It was even worse than I remembered it. It was served in a clear plastic bottle as no glass allowed at football but I don't think that played a part, as it wasn't as if I'd particularly enjoyed the previous ones I'd had from glass bottles. It's better cask, but bottled it just was not nice at all. It's such a shame that so many good brewers get swallowed up or go bust and yet this over-hyped brand sells so well. Neither of us could finish our bottles and threw about half away. £8.20 well spent, not. And did I mention the football was rubbish too?\n",
      "Medium brown body and modest foam, very little aroma except maybe some malt sweetness. Flavour is weak malt with a somehow boozy kick, soft caramel. Mouthfeel has a bit of dryness but is otherwise weak. This is missing all the essential elements in a bitter.\n",
      "Can (Aug 21, 2019 canning).\n",
      "\n",
      "Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.\n",
      "Body is cloudy/murky medium yellow.\n",

      "Finish is lightly sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extremely sour, watery, and dirty. The misspelling of Scandinavia on the label is a nice touch too. Easily the worst thing I've had from CW so far, but they've all been pretty bad.\n",
      "Clearish brown body and okay foam, thin and faint molasses on the nose. Flavour is soft tin and sugar. Malt character is too subdued and the sugar lingers. This one is a miss.\n",
      "Can: Poured a reddish with pink edges, head is white. Aroma is musty socks and light blueberry. Taste is sweet with blueberry dominating over apple.\n",
      "This is the closest thing to a drain pour I've had In a loooong time.  12 oz. can purchased in San Antonio, TX. Pitch black pour with dark ruby highlights and a fizzy medium brown head and good retention. Spotty lacing. Aroma of dark booze. Flavors of black licorice and in-your-face booze. Any other would-be flavors are drowned out by alcohol. Ugh! This stuff would be better served for cleaning windshields!\n",
      "Encore une goutée au portugal mais il faut rendre à Cesar... CEte biere est à priori fabriquée en allemagne soit disant comme représentante de l'esprit craft beer et c'est encore une fois bien raté. Comme pour la red ale, elle arrache la gorge. Le houblon est présent mais aggressif et sans intérêt.\n",

      "Watery grainy bready beginning. Lots of watery bread, no bitterness, lots of watery sweetish bready grain. Very bad. Not even bitterness to hide this bad no-alcohol-flavour.\n",
      "Bottle from the Co-op in Ancaster, near Grantham. Can't say I like this. It has a very unpleasant back of the mouth bitterness, which I assume comes from the oranges. Poured away.\n",
      "Can sample at a tasting at Max's place. Thanks zvsn. Clear golden. Cardboard, oxidation, graininess, sweetish, faint bitterness, light-bodied.\n",
      "Strange brew.  Light head and really nice color.  The beer has a strange aftertaste that is quite unpleasant.  Not sure exactly what it is but won’t be ordering this again\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2016. Aroma is minimal, with some pale malt and mild floral hops, along with a light chemical note. Mineral and grainy flavours with a hint of hop bitterness and slight metallic edge.\n",
      "Pale golden color, fairly weak white head. \n",
      "Aroma of corn, nothing else. \n",
      "Taste is really corny, some very faint malts, and very thin hoppiness. Very weak bodied, medium carbonation... cheap beer for the alcoholics. Not awful, just not good.\n",
      "Aroma; caramel, plum, apple. Look; fawn foam head, dark amber body. Taste; caramel, syrup, herbs, and finishes sweetbarked. Feel; ok body, modest co². Overall; least ipa'ish IPA I've tasted ever. [ltl btl f CittiM @im hauslicher Umgebung] 33436\n",

      "Henninger. Greek version brewed at Olympic. 4.3% can. Since 1869 apparently. Dubious claim in respect on this particular iteration of this product. Consumed on a windy but very sunny Mykonos terrace. Pale yellow. Papery aroma. Quite highly carbonated with a metallic taste. No malt or hops flavours. Coloured fizzy water. Quite poor. 3-4-3-2-6=1.8\n",
      "This is by far the blandest beer I have ever had.  I see the word sour on the label so I'm thinking that this might be a gose or a Berliner Weiss style of beer.  This was nothing what I was expecting.  I've been to the brewery and I love Sam Adams, however this is the first time I have ever been disappointed by them.  If you are a true fan of sour beer, do yourself a favor and not even bother with this one.\n",

      "The Aromas are yeast, tart Orange. Flavors are sweet tart floral Orange with a flavor that's hard to get around which is really bad orange candy. Going to have a hard time finishing this one.\n",
      "Bottle from vintage, $3. Yes, pour is nice dark brown and it does smell like malt & filberts. The taste shockingly announces its 10%! Whew. Wassermann warming sensations as it hits the gullet. Forget that, I may get sued by a snowflake. This stuff is sending me to may safe zone, way back there. Strong big ass drink, lots of vyzhah. Middle is menacing choco malted filbert megah. Two of these and yi'll be on the floor. Heavy medicinal boozy finish. Yes, strong armed american ale from start to finish. Flavors hide the cloying alky laced clown hiding back there down in the ghetto, behind the barrels.\n",

      "My glass is sitting a foot away from me and I can smell the strawberry. Strawberry in beer? I do love a fruity beer, but this takes the biscuit. It just doesn't work.\n",
      "Color amarillo muy pálido, transparente. Espuma blanca de más de un dedo de espesor y corta retención. Aroma escaso a cereal con notas cítricas y cartón mojado. Ojalá el sabor fuera en esa línea, puro extracto, desequilibrada, final corto de amargor escaso, aún así es muy desagradable, alcohol... yo qué sé, si le he dado dos tragos y la he tirado por el fregadero.\n",

      "330ml bottle. Clear, yellow-ish, pale golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Strawy and metallic, hoppy aroma, a touch of limescale. Taste is minimally sweet pale malty, strawy, plain bitter hoppy.\n",
      "500ml can. Clear, orangey golden colour with average to huge, frothy, collapsing, white head. Grainy, strawy aroma with a penetrative note of ammonia. Taste is sweet-ish pale malty, minimally strawy, bready, grainy, plain bitter hoppy overtones; slightly oily texture, soft carbonation. Really bad.\n",
      "A small bottle from 7-11 round the back of the workplace. Aroma: coffee. Appearance: coffee. Palate: medium-bodied and oily, average carbonation, finish is coffee. Taste: this basically tastes like coffee with some beer in it. Pointless - drink it for breakfast maybe...\n",

      "Worst iteration of a Belgian White I have ever tasted.  Only grabbed it because the store was closing.  Slight citrus taste, no detectable coriander.  Tastes like a Budweiser poured over an orange peel.  Will not make this mistake again.\n",
      "This brown ale poured a deep brown colour with a huge, tan coloured head. This beer was almost impossible to pour from a bottle. Even the slowest pour gave me nothing but head. Scents include brown sugar, baked beans an ripe fruit. First swig was really carbonated. Very fizzy to the tongue. Flavours of maple syrup/baked bean syrup, over-ripened fruit, alcohol and a wee bit of wine. Finish was quite sweet also with that near baked bean flavour lingering.\n",
      "The colour is golden, it looks nice. But the aroma is poor and the taste is very bad.\n",
      "Odd orangy pink pour. Smells like bathroom spray. Strange flavor of fruit juice and Certs. The slight mint taste is truly bizarre. This beer is really weird. Can.\n",
      "Bottle pours into glass with an unexpected over the top foaming activity. Settles to a beauty of sizzling action within iced tea eye. First taste is foam, to stop a spill. Volatile, alky laced blast in the facial senses. Rich thick medicinal feel to this alky bomb. Warming sensations? Fer sher, back of mouth and down the throat. Seems like it could be used as a disinfecting surface cleaner. Rude, hope this ages well. Expecting sherry, yah know? Well, this aint there yet.  Straight up kick you in the face, be prepared to sip for a while. Suddenly, half way thru the bottle, I begin to get dizzy, I think.\n",

      "Soft banana aroma, has murky orange body with little foam. Flavour is this awful cloying bitter citrus. The banana is way down there, nothing is balanced. Then there's this bad bitter aftertaste, like they took the whole orange skin and thought making that the primary flavour was a good thing. I sure hope this is infected and not intentionally like this.\n",
      "Has a weak clear yellow body with no foam, smells of soft nothingness, maybe vague sweetness. Flavour is weak lager and maybe sweet green tea but I'd challenge anyone to notice it without being told it's there. Mouthfeel is full anyway. It's a letdown, just a weak lager, no balance.\n",
      "Keg at BrewDog Outpost Tower Hill.  Dark brown with no head.  Aroma of roasted nuts, chocolate and popcorn... kind of like I remember cinema lobbies smelling of.  Very thin body, probably to be expected.  A bit too sweet too.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at the Steel City Beer Festival '19, Kelham Island Museum, Sheffield. Hazy gold with white head. Well I'm really not sure if this beer was meant to be like this, I could hardly believe it could be but it was vinegar, vomit, sicky in character, thin. Pretty bad.\n",

      "wow, there is a ton of cranberry flavor to this. it is unbelievably sweet. the vanilla and cinnamon are there as well. unfortunately, the flavors just don't come together and the sweetness made thus basically undrinkable. I dumped half.\n",
      "330ml can at We Brought Beer, Tooting.  Hazy deep golden with notable floating sediment.  Very resinous and tinned fruit aroma.  Syrupy flavour.\n",
      "440ml Can from Sainsbury's, Team Valley, Gateshead. Pale straw-clear coloured with no head. It has a thin toffee, grassy and corn flavour with a biscuit and thin earthy finish. Poor even for the ABV.\n",
      "Pours a light golden color with a thin white head. Aroma is slight. Taste is slightly sour....a little watery.\n",
      "Can: Poured a clear amber color lager with a light foamy head. Aroma of light adjunct is pretty bland. Taste is also a mix of light adjunct notes with some residual sugar with a bland finish. Body is light with good carbonation. There is better NA beer out there.\n",
      "Wow this one was foul. Like an alcohol swab mixed with bad/harsh sake. Not really fruity at all. Just hurt to drink. Bleck.\n",
      "On tap at Shacklands, pours a deep dark mahogany with a small beige head. Aroma brings out cloying syrup, caramel, and toffee. Flavour is a cloyingly sweet mess, with lots of syrup, caramel and nastily sweet esters. This is hilariously bad. Embarrassing to put out product this off-the-mark.\n",
      "On tap at Shacklands, pours a hazy dull yellow, little head. Nose has some strange off-notes, with saison yeast, light phenols, and plastic. Flavour is quite revolting, with plastic, phenols, and saison yeast. Something went brutally wrong here.\n",
      "On tap at Shacklands, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma is quite estery, with candied sugar, phenols, and Belgian yeast. Flavour is just disgusting, with phenols and who knows what other off-notes. This is rancid.\n",
      "Can from Secret Summer Santa 2019 Beerhunter111, cheers! Starts off as a nicely fruity sour and finishes as a lingering box of matches. Didn't finish it. Not sure what happened here.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Minimally cloudy, yellow-ish, very pale golden colour with small to average, frothy, fading, white head. Not far from neutral, sugary lemon aroma, hints of artificial sweetener, a touch of citric acid, minimally srawy overtones. Taste is dry, papery and slightly sugary, a touch of lemon juice pops up for a very short period in the middle part; initially slightly prickly carbonation ends in debility, leading to an almost smeary finish. Who would have thought that Beck's can do worse once again?\n",
      "Keg at BrewDog Clapham Junction, Battersea.  Cloudy ochre with a vanishing white head.  Aroma of grassy hops, light tartness and chalky note.  Some flat fruit flavours followed by an unpleasant, very soapy linger.\n",

      "Tap. Cloudy yellow color. Small size, off-white head, stays as a ring. Sweet, vanilla, pink sefir in aroma/taste. Why?\n",
      "Cloudy yellow body and okay foam, smells like semi farty hops and some lager sweetness. The flavour is weak pilsner notes, sweet lager hops, kind of leaning into pilsner but really just a sugary mess. I got no idea how they messed this up so bad, they should be doing better even for a trickier style like pilsner.\n",
      "Murky ruby brown body and okay foam, heavy raspberry and fig that comes across like bad cologne. Evening smoking jacket and hairy chest and all. Or maybe your grandpa's aftershave. Flavour is heavy raspberry and the fig makes it taste like cough syrup, and that stuff lingers on your tongue. Yeah, cough syrup beer - not my kind of thing.\n",
      "Clear yellow body and good foam, sweet lemony lager hops on the nose. Flavour is mellow grain with a watery finish. There's nothing here, so why bother?\n",
      "This is utter piss, what the actual hell were they thinking putting cheap strawberry flavour in a supposed hop forward beer? This is an utter abomination, it is awful. How can I not swear? Utter utter utter isht. Do the anagram, don't drink this. Rate beer, my rating is zero, but you won't accept this\n",
      "Typical golden ale. Urine flavour reigns prominent after the immediate taste. There are some tropical notes, but the body is much too thin to sustain them.\n",
      "dose von kaufland. ta ciecz moze posluzyc jako soczek do dolewania do zwyklego jasnego lagera pania. Idealnie sie komponuje, jeszcze wlozyc rozowa slomke to mamy super odlotowego slodkiego drinka. Dotykane ustami pare lat temu, co mnie wzielo by zaliczyc te serie z kauflanda i jeszcze to pominac. Takie rarytasy trudno zapomniec.\n",
      "karton 20 puszek kupiony w kauflandzie ekipie ocieplajacej nasz dom. pare ladnych lat temu. Slabe, malo nachmielone, wodniste i pachnie skunksem. Moze zaprawa murarska wpadla do tej puszki lub farba. W kazdym razie malownicze to piwo nie bylo\n",
      "puszka jakis czas temu kupiona ojcu. jeden malenki lyk i mozna popsuc sobie humor na caly dzien. W smaku jak gazowana woda mineralna z dodatkiem plynu znajdujacego sie w puszce z kukurydza.\n",
      "Very bitter and tangy. Far too many hops. Difficult to enjoy as it's so harsh on the taste buds. Very fruity grapefruit taste and too citric for my taste\n",
      "On tap at Saulter Street, pours a fairly clear dull orangey blonde with a small white head. Aroma is full of diacetyl, with bready malt and subdued hops - yuck. Flavour is just rancid, being totally ruined by diacetyl, followed by harshly bitter hops. Gross bitter butter bomb.\n",
      "On tap at Saulter Street, pours a hazy dark amber, no head. Nose is somewhat offensive, with paint thinner, perfume and English bready malt. Flavour is even harsher and more offensive, with lots of paint thinner, varnish, and metallic notes. This is all sorts of messed up. Totally flat carbonation doesn’t help either, as all those off-notes are clearly distinguishable. This shouldn’t be sold.\n",
      "330ml bottle. Crystal clear, orangey, pale golden colour with average, frothy, rapidly diminishing, white head. Artificial lemon aroma, hints of artificial sweetener, strawy background. Taste is sugary sweet and artificially citrusy, notes of citric acid, artificial sweetener, sugary sweet finish; light and watery. Extremely bad, even for a Radler.\n",
      "The beer now has 9% alcohol (bottle 0,33cl). It's a bit sweet and you can sense the alcohol.\n",
      "Tap (CollabFest2019, Brewdog, Tallinn) (3:2:3:1:5=1.4)\n",
      "Pale orange, cloudy, no head. Harsh acidic aroma, sour, and threats of hopburn. Justified - terrible hopburn in the mouth, dusty and dirty taste too. Some berry skins. Complete garbage.\n",

      "[12oz bottle from Total Wines, Brea, CA.] A bright orange amber pour with a thick cream coloured head; an oddly familiar, but unidentifiable, spicy aroma - perhaps a fabric softener or room freshener; thin and watery with a similar spicy taste, and some vanilla and caramel. One sip was enough - an immediate drain pour for me.\n",

      "Despicable:  it'sworst beer I've had in years and a complete drain pour. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.\n",

      "440ml can: BB 19th Sep 2020. Poured into a UK pint sleeve at home on 17th Oct 2019. Murky dull orange, scummy head. I am all for trying new stuff but Yuzu and semi-sour citrus fruits combined, plus hops that have a citrus leaning, is too far for my delicate palate. I thought this 'bloody awful'.\n",

      "O ile wygląd i aromat dają radę (coś ala rodzynki i wiśnie) o tyle smak to totalna porażka. Jakby do najgorszej podróbki coca coli dodać pół kilo cukru więcej. Po całkiem udanym Chmielonym na Zimno myślałem, że coś w Edim ruszyło...\n",

      "The looks of the beer are fine. It doesn't look too exciting. The beer has a slight pale golden yellow colour. On top some rough white foam is formed, but it ain't much and after some seconds all is gone besides a minimal drape. The beer is crystal clear.\n",
      "The aroma of the beer is meh. It is simple. The malts give a grainy note, but the cheap corn flakes give it a cheap grain dust note. A bit nutty, but not that nice. The hops aren't very aromatic. There might be a zesty touch there, but not the 'lime wedge' that is promised. It is simple. Not a very entertaining drink.\n",
      "The taste of the beer also ain't world class. Some sweet malts, some bitterness from the hops. The bitterness is a bit sharp. It isn't very bitter, but it doesn't feel completely harmonious. Could be better. \n",
      "The palate of the beer is fine. Light body, thin texture and high carbonation. The finish is sort. Some bitter hops at first followed by some of the nutty notes. But soon after that, nothing. A very very simple beer...\n",

      "Lagunitas \"Lagunitasized\" this beer and ruined it terribly.  What used to be a smooth caramel malt they turned into a [email protected] love child of their IPA and a medium lager.  It has lost all of what made it a British beer, except the color.  They lightened a medium body brown ale and added a light hop to it. It has an unbalanced flavor and is too light.  The only thing they kept the same was the ABV.\n",
      "Golden color. Brutally bad stuff at the D'town location, Notes were Acetone, apples, and Ass. Undrinkable and shouldn't have been served.\n",
      "Hazy golden in Downingtown. Worst in show of the day. This thing was pure buttercream DMS Acid vinegar. Painful sip I had to take.\n",
      "Draft. Clear amber body, small beige head. The aroma has some iron and malt. The taste is mellow.\n",
      "On tap at Pat’s Pub, pours a clear copper red with a small beige head. Aroma is artificially sweet, with tart cranberry and sweet apple juice. Flavour is nastily sweet, with artificial cranberry and apple. Syrupy crap. Terrible.\n",
      "On tap at Pat’s Pub, pours a cloudy, murky orange with a small white head. Aroma is full of diacetyl, with subdued strawberry sickly sweet honey - smells horrendous. Flavour is disgusting, with cloyingly sweet strawberry, nasty honey, and diacetyl. Infected, nasty shit.\n",
      "On tap at Postmark, pours a cloudy blonde with a small white head. Aroma is loaded with lacto and a touch of citrus. Flavour is very bitter, with lots of lacto, extremely bitter citrus. Very bitter and harsh. Crappy beer.\n",
      "On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a cloudy dull orange with a small white head. Aroma is chaotic and full of glue / paint thinner, with a trace of barrels. Flavour is a total mess, with glue, barrels, paint thinner and booze. A totally incoherent mess. Needs a lot of work.\n",
      "On tap at the Alibi Room, pours a murky yellowish blonde with a small white head. Aroma is very yeasty and chalky, with biscuity malt. Flavour is harshly bitter, with earthy notes, chalky notes, and glue. This is egregious. Horrendous.\n",
      "It pours hazy yellow with a white head. It has alcohol with spices up front. There are some orange and lemon elements. It is also a bit medicinal.\n",

      "Pours a clear orange with little to no white head dissipating quickly. Aroma of peach, light wheat. Taste is boozy peach wheat. Light-watery body. Crisp and refreshing.\n",
      "Can from total wine on park in fla. Bigfoamy head on a rather clear pale ale. Smells like mild IPA. Taste is the same. Quite bitter. Probably should be rated as one. I've had other IPA that have been less bitter than this. Yes, way too bitter for a APA. Ends with an impression of green grapefruit rind.\n",

      "Golden straw and very clear, the body has a few bubbles showing as well but there's no sign of any real head. There was a tonne of sweetness on the nose with some corn and sugars but it seemed more like an iced tea with only some skunk notes at the end signalling it was a beer. The taste was similarly sweet upfront with a lot of sugars but quickly turned bitter with some corn and cheap, almost off-adjuncts. There wasn't much to the beer really, with some artificial sugars seeing things out and the body was a very light with a thin feel that lacked balance too; terrible stuff and definitely one to avoid. \n",

      "One left in my fridge by my brother in-law after his family’s stay at my place. Might as well rate which is weird to do after 5k rates on this site.  If asked my least favorite beer in world for last 2 decades this would be my choice, although it’s been many years since I had last. I often would say 4 of these would give same hangover as 12 Busch light at least I used to say that 20 years ago, long before my beer snobbishness.  Pale yellow brew with a smallish white head. Nose is light sour mash and wet cardboard.  Tastes of corn, grain, wet dog, and tears.  Some urine qualities in after taste. More bitter than I recall.  I my beer journeys since college I’ve had less drinkable swill but casual conversation I’ll still say this is my least favorite brew.\n",
      "can in Manchester VT --- 2/26/19 --- Aroma of malt and light hops.  Hazy amber brown color, ivory head that drops to a thick rim, wide bands of lace.  Taste is malt with an odd hops addition on a lightly carbonated swallow.  Medium finish which actually can't get over soon enough.  I think this is past its prime.  Too bad, but if I pay for it, I rate it.\n",
      "Oh dear, what a pint of wasted opportunity. A long drink of nothing from a brewery that could've used this event to promote something decent. Colour, flavour, texture all pale - in the manner of paling into blandness.\n",
      "Smells like malt. Tastes like malt. Probably malt then. Why bother with any other ingredients if you can get away with this and for some reason beyond understanding people are buying it? Where are all those hops mentioned in the description; cancelled each other out maybe?\n",
      "backlog from summer: clear golden colour, large, dense white head; aroma of canned apple, apple peel and some malts; taste also has  strong canned apple notes and some artificial rum notes - more like a Sweet apple cider than a beer based on its taste and aroma, which is really strange\n",

How this was ever passed off as a beer is beyond me as it really isn't appealing at all. Some might like it if they like the heavily spiced Belgian offerings but it's not for me. I had to pour half down the sink as I just couldn't get on with it.\n",

      "This was my least favorite of the ciders I tried by a bit. Just has a strong Jolly Rancher flavor. Very sweet and not tasty.\n",
      "Drank in celebration of Il Lombardia cycling race. Pale golden coloured with a very thin white head. It has a toffee, corn and malty flavour with a warming, spicy biscuit and grassy, corn finish. Ok. 500ml Bottle from Aldi, Wrekenton, Gateshead.\n",
      "440ml can from Morrison’s. \n",
      "Decent sized white head, a little lacing. Hazy golden amber body. Nose smells strongly of washing up liquid. Flavour is grapefruit, yuzu, more washing up liquid. Bitterness comes through on the finish with lasting grapefruit notes. Medium carbonation, good mouthfeel. I like yuzu in beer but there’s too much in this, it doesn’t work with the hops.\n",
      "On nitro tap at Stemma, pours black with a small beige head. Aroma is full of metallic notes, with a little cocoa - yuck. Flavour is full of metallic character, with some lactose and cocoa. Way too metallic. Weak.\n",
      "On tap at Aslan, pours an opaque yellow with a small white head. Aroma is unpleasant, with chalky yeast, citrus and some sourness. Flavour is revolting, with chalky yeast, sour citrus and some stale notes. This terribleness just keeps lingering. Awful.\n",
      "On tap at Wander, pours a cloudy bright yellow with a small white head. Aroma is full of chalky yeast, with dank, harsh hops. Flavour is pure yeast and chalk, with harsh hops, dirty yeast, chalk. This is revolting - frankly, how can they sell this? Awful.\n",
      "Strong rye bread aroma\n",
      "Taste is bitter, bread and malt. \n",
      "It's like a rough sketch compared to other st.peters ales, which are a beautiful painting.\n",
      "If you have ever tried kvass - that's it, just not sour and really bitter.\n",
      "On tap at the Rebel Inn, Streatham. Copper gold, dense white head. Faint citrus aroma - grapefruit, floral, sweet. In taste, musty and bitter with notes of orange, low carbonation, touch flat and watery, chemical after taste at the back of the mouth. Muddy flavour - all in all, not a very good ale. Didn’t finish it.\n",
      "Soft grain aroma, yellowy body and little foam. Flavour is boozy grains. Overall though it's weak and boring, and I got no idea how it's a \"Nordic\" anything.\n",
      "Pression de 50 CL. Robe dorée limpide avec une légère mousse blanche. Arômes de malts. Texture aqueuse, carbonatation faible, légère, sucrée. Notes maltées, citron. Finale courte et maltée. A fuir même quand il n'y a que ça à boire.\n",
      "No smell, weak yellow body. Flavour is weak and harsh hops with a cloying aftertaste. Whatever they did on this one, I hope they don't do it again.\n",
      "Can, Sainsbury, Wigston. Golden with a white foam. Cereal and mineral water. A load of tod. Bought it for shandy. Not good on its own.\n",
      "Awful worst pint I've ever had tastes like balsamic vinegar at best. Had it at mother Macs in manchester\n",
      "Jak na Hefe-Weizena jest średnio poprawne. Zapach jest przyjemny, cytrusowy na finiszu, można go wyróżnić na tle pozostałych piw tej marki. Design puszki - jak w innych Stephansach Bräuach, jest ok. Natomiast smak kompletnie mi nie podchodzi, smakuje to jak znieczulenie u dentysty, nie jest zbyt fajny, liczę się jednak z tym że to tylko moje odczucia. Pijalne na spokojnie, nie ma dużych wad, żadnych gwoździ ani DMS-u. Ja natomiast kompletnie nie mogę tego przepić, głównie przez smak dentystycznej chemii. Jak ktoś lubi - mi casa es su casa.\n",
      "Kolejne piwo spod marki Stephans Bräu. Jest niestety nieciekawe. Kompletnie nic się nie dzieje, pustka w smaku jak i w zapachu, niestety na końcu pozostawia jakiś obrzydliwy posmak stęchlizny. O wiele gorszy niż pils tego samego producenta. Puszka typowa dla tej marki - przyjemna. Nie polecam, lepiej kupić np. czarnego Bräua.\n",

      "Czuć lekki posmak paloności, czasami uwolniła się nuta karmelu. Dla mnie jest to bardzo mocno niedorobiony pseudo-porter, głównie przez swoją kwaśność, która jest aż zanadto duża. W aromacie da się wyczuć słodowość, nie jest ona przytłaczająca, jednak nie jest też przyjemna. Wygląd jak każdy Stephans Bräu. Nie jest aż tak źle.\n",
      "Cena w miarę niska, jak za takie w miarę mało wadliwe piwo. Puszka wygląda okej, smakuje słodowo z przebijającym się gdzieniegdzie chmielem. Największa wada to aromat - pachnie gotowanymi warzywami. Jak na taniego pilsa, to jest w miarę pijalne, pewnie schłodzone smakuje jeszcze lepiej. Gorzej niż koncerniaki ale stabilnie.\n",
      "Many thanks for this beer to Beerhunter111. Pours a hazy golden colour with a medium white head. Sweet lemon aroma.\n",
      "A \"Dry-Hopped Mexican Lager\". This one is more hoppy than it is \"Mexican\". The low-alcohol content makes it not worth dealing with the flavor.\n",
      "Sampled at Great American Beer Festival 2019 in Denver, Colorado. Funky, sweet, fruity - not very good.\n",
      "The Aromas Are cereal and sweet. Flavors are this kind of odd out of place Sweet Cherry and generic beer. Has kind of a weird texture and not pleasant finish. Not like any other American lager I've had.\n",
      "Pint can.  Nose sort of a lemon-lime-agave, very spritzy, but there's also some stale air.   Pour clear, deeply rich golden, white head fizzes itself out rather quickly, plenty of remaining carbonation.  Taste boozy, fusels, corn, buttery, stale vegetal, stale lime, and some queasy salsa associations.  Medium sweet that accumulates, low to no bitterness, just a hint of tang from the citrus.  Medium body buttery, somewhat crisp, corn again a problem here, a little gassy-phenolic but not much.  Maybe if I throw in a few ice cubes?  Don't release this garbage.  [2019.10.11: 1.4]\n",
      "An infected gusher. Blew up all over my jeans -- luckily not my laptop next to me. Lots of bretta or some other sour infection. Pours, or rather explodes, orange with massive head. Smells a little off, based on my jeans. Sourish finish. Can.\n",
      "Cask at the moon under water Watford Jdw. A clear golden orange coloured pour with a a speckled off white head. Aroma is big diacetyl, toffee, buttered bread, apple. Flavour is composed of toffee, apple, nutty malts with alcohol bite. Bitter toffee apple. Paalte is semi sweet, bitter, vanilla. Harsh. Shite.\n",
      "Bottle - dirty orange with no head - not appealing.Fairly strong aroma but again not very appealing. Very gassy.  Not good tasting - checked date - well inside recommended but couldn't drink. May be just off?\n",
      "Just another of a grand-zillion other IPA out yonder, but it at least has some cutting co2 on the palate that almost makes me forget its an IPA. Its bitter and yer hop-ness is quite fresh tho still very bitter. A little difficult in the end. Some hints of poorly made homemade cider.\n",

      "Okayish clear yellow body and no foam, boozy apple on the nose with a bit of sweet cheese funk. Flavour is more sweet cheesy apple. Finish is quite boozy, alcohol is front and centre. Apples taste green for sure. This stuff is an oozing disjointed mess.\n",
      "Muddy pinkish opaque stuff. No head. Oooof, massive diacetyl, butyric...is this a massive pedio bomb? Should I even bother taking a sip. OK, I do taste a bit of blackberry on the nose, but fuck knows it's just utterly buried in diacetyl. Absolutely nasty.\n",
      "473mL can, pours an opaque filhty dark pink with a small white head. Aroma is egregious, with rotting pithy blackberries, lime, and perfume -- offensive as fuck. Flavour is somehow a little less offensive, with bitter perfumy hops, and lime. Pithy, perfumey, and chaotic as hell. This is really bad.\n",
      "Yuk. Not a fan of this flavour at all. I would have enjoyed a Bud more. This isn't the delicious IPA I'm looking for...\n",
      "this was not very tasty. a bit of a dirty flavor to go with a general lightness.\n",
      "Can from chalet.  Considering the description on the can, i thought this would be a much darker beer. Does have odd nose mixed with spice. Stronger volatile cloying sweetness immediately grabs my palate. Spiced, yes. October? I'm thinking this taste more like one of those winter holiday spiced bombs. Looks pleasant, smells fairly pleasant but the taste is out of this world. Gets quite difficult at the end of a can. OK for a tick but would not repeat.\n",
      "Very dissapointing, chemical taste, made worse by coming straight after a Röthaus\n",
      "500ml bottle. Hazy, yellow-ish, very pale golden colour with average, frothy, fading, white head. Lemon juice aroma, slightly sugary background, a minimally artificial touch. Taste is sweet-and-sour, sugary and fruity, notes of lemon juice, a dry touch of artificial sweetener. Watery texture, slightly sticky palate. (Too) sweet lemonade.\n",
      "Pleasant straw aroma, very faint straw taste, no discernible bitterness. Burping,  so way too fizzy, but if it was flatter it would probably taste even worse! A complete waste of money.\n",
      "Another stout served ice cold. All the taste gets lost because of the cool temperature. Just tastes very bland and boring like a very cheap cup of coffee that's gone cold\n",
      "From bottle (Beer Store) in tulip. Pours golden w/big, billowing head, grassy & malty aroma. Creamy malt taste mixed w/a bit of light lemon.\n",

      "I've never reviewed or returned any alcohol before, but I most definitely will be returning this. I'll skip the fancy words. It almost has a bubblegum taste to it, it's so artificial and terrible tasting. I do not recommend at all.\n",
      "Terrible label,  standard longneck,  burnt blonde, clear pour.  Perfumy,  sweet,  as allspice,  cinnamon, nutmeg,  spicecake aroma.  Squashy, saline,  spice-bitter. Suitable for pork marinade,  but not for drinking. Zucchini,  clovey aftertaste,  medium body, low carbonation.  External use only.  Trader Joe's, Tallahassee.\n",

      "Has big solid foam on a heavily carbonated gold body, smells like wet sugar and bread crumbs. Flavour is wet breadcrumbs with sweet caramel and tin on the back end. Full enough mouthfeel. There are certainly worse low alcohols out there, this one's passable.\n",
      "Would be a decent cider with better quality control. 2 of 3 six packs, purchased over a 4 week period,  were sulfur tainted (due to starving the yeast during fermentation). Brewer is slow to reimburse for the nasty sulfur cider.\n",
      "On tap at Bomber, pours a cloudy muffled golden with a tiny head. Aroma brings out lots of lacto, light dry hops, and some pithy stone fruits. Flavour is seriously messed up, with harsh hops, some nasty chemical notes (butyric?), and lacto. This is all sorts of messed up. Undrinkable.\n",
      "Bouteille - 500ml. Robe de couleur paille, bien voilée, effervescente et coiffée d'une écume blanche mince mais persistante. Arôme malté et agrémenté de nuances florales, herbacées mais aussi de nettoyant industriel. En bouche, on retrouve les mêmes pointes savonneuses qui gâchent toute l'expérience. Des notes de cuir/vinyl sont aussi décelables. Brève finale citronnée/herbacée. Un désastre de la part d'un brasseur qui nous a habitués à beaucoup mieux au cours de la dernière année. Drainpour.\n",
      "Bottle 35.5cl. @home poured into a pint glass. Cloudy deep amber, a lot of small bubbles, small fizzy off-white head, vanishes quickly; aroma strawberry, bubblegum, candy sugar, toffee; taste heavy sweet and light acidity, strawberry, bubblegum, candy sugar; light body, sticky texture; the light acidity is no match for the overwhelming cloying sweetness, also too artificial.\n",
      "Oops, picked up this can of IPA by accident, thought it was a milk stout, oh well. Well, it is pretty hazy but not muddy as name would indicate. Smell is muted IPA perfume. Rude crude uninteresting bitterness like any other IPA. As a matter of fact, this is more bitter than many double IPA I've had. Yes, just another one of a billion IPA out there, not much difference. I guess the politically correct term for craft beer nowadays is IPA. What ever  -  WTF?  Not impressed, the hops cover any imperfections the beer may actually have. Tastes is almost identical the the double IPA I just had, or is this the problem with IPA; after you drink a good one, your taste buds are ruined for an hour or so? Let me simply ask: Do you like chewing on a fresh rubber inner tube mixed with green grapefruit rinds and old weathered pine tar sap, chased with turpentine? Just asking. One rude straight up ass beer style.\n",
      "So here we are, the strange chief of police. Well, I guess its a close resemblance to Harbour. At almost 10% no wonder why you feel like you used to live out a carefree existence - yet haunted by a troubled past. Pours out a bit thick and hazy. Smell in non-offensive but the taste really kicks your ass. The amount of hop bitterness makes it a one sided flavor that would cover any possible beer imperfections. Whew. There you have it; terribly on style, go figger. Its just another one of a quadra-million purposefully high-hopped beers out there. At least it was in a bottle.\n",
      "Dumpf getreidiger, hell herber Beginn. Trocken, wenig bitter. Konstante Aromatik, langweilig, trockener Abgang. 9/7/8/6/9/6\n",
      "500ml bottle. Clear, chestnut colour with ruby glimmer and average to huge, thick, creamy, moderately lasting, minimally lacing, off-white head. Herbal and fruity aroma, slightly strange, sugary, artificial notes of cola, a touch of cherry, \"Wassereis\". Taste is sugary sweet and slightly fruity, notes of cola, hints of cherry, artificial sweetener; medicamentous. dry finish. Quite crappy.\n",
      "Pounder: Rotten raspberry, vanilla, garbage nose. Cloudy pink, thin head. Raspberry, coconut, cocoa. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Pretty much a mess.\n",

      "Suchy lager, nic w nim nadzwyczajnego, jasny czysty, piana szybko opada. W smaku i aromacie pustka\n",
      "Black beer with very short light brown head, smell is sour - not more, taste is light and short roasty malts, light bread, very light watery, no coffee or others, thin texture, average carbonation, medium body, boring\n",
      "Coded 135 9 2, 3802 0503.  Typical Laggy bottle. Smells like viscous IPA. Pour is pale with chunks in it. All floating around and shit, but surprisingly still. Head fades to 1/2 inch. First taste is just the most plainly rude straight up ass IPA I've had in a fortnight, it must be imperial. I swear it almost gives me a gag reflex, but not. Come now, how is this not in the IPA style? Too big boozy & bosomed for an APA. Just asking. Pretty soon they are gonna have to make a new style APA wannahbee IPA. Yes, terribly on style with the best of the IPA and many imperial IPA, or should I say double IPA, or should I say double imperial india pale ale? JMHO, there you have it. Yes, this is not an APA, please change the style admin, hehehehhh.\n",
      "Nope. Looks like a really nice pint in the glass but from the very first sip it's a wrong 'un. Where are the ingredients? Barely anything on the nose, thin and a little oily and no flavour. The very faintest distant wave of hops and not even malt. Nothing's happening here.\n",

      "Bottle. Clear pale yellow with white head. The aroma has notes of grains, corn, vomit and minerals. The flavor is mild sweet and bitter with notes of corn, grains, minerals, black pepper. Light-bodied.\n",
      "# 400; 8/2016. Vzhledem velice pěkný helles, v chuti klasicky sladový až obilný, navíc ale nakyslý a slizský, silně zoxidovaný.\n",
      "Not a fan of the style, but this was a particularly horrible example. Honestly like a cheap lager brewed with washing liquid.\n",
      "Pours clear golden with a foamy white head. Aroma of rice malt. Taste is watery, mild grass and bread notes. Palate has honey. Meh.\n",
      "What the hell is it? You call it ipa?\n",
      "Drink in Applebee’s. With nauseous pasta and sweet Asian chili source and Parmesan\n",
      "this tastes like flavored water. no beer flavor at all. feels like a nice replacement for a La Croix, which also has very little flavor.\n",
      "umm, no. I just don't like the flavor of cucumber. this has an obvious cucumber flavor. very faint sour. just doesn't work for me. don't care that everyone else likes this. can't drink it.\n",
      "Tailgating at a Philadelphia Eagles game I actually drink half of a can. This is pretty awful. I went over 9 years on Ratebeer without putting in a review.  ( I am so disappointed in myself right now ). Aroma is just  skunky yeast. Flavor is rice, corn, and maybe lager yeast. Extremely watery. Does not finish well either. Well, at least the Eagles destroyed the New York Jets.\n",
      "Bottle shared in London - picked up at Pigs Ear 2018. Pours clear brown with a bubbly, tan head. Awful aroma, all plastic burnt malts. Unpleasant flavour, no other way to say it, lots of charred carpets, dirt. Full bodied, oily, with minimal carbonation. Lingering terrible flavours in the finish. Truly horrible beer. Can't understand how it went so wrong.\n",

      "Overall: Awful! Strange, flawed aroma and very bland taste...\n",
      "Hah! I thought I rated this already. Bottle. Smells like a fest beer. Darker hue pale. Nice head and lots of lively co2 visible in the brew, hope it carries over to the palate. Each slug is the same, it wants to be a decent fest beer but the middle turns into an unpleasant higher alky astringent annoying kick of bitterness, quite surprising in its power. It lingers in your moth for such a long time. This gottah be way more than 30 IBU, no shit and its difficult too! Grinding gooch, gook, gringo, guido, grahzilla. Very unwanted sharply bitter finish, whew.\n",
      "Supposedly I never reviewed this beer. Yeah, right. It's the best of the white trash beers, or should I say white collar? It pours deep golden with very minimal white head. The aroma is pleasant compared to Busch, Mickey's, etc. so it smells like something you might want to drink, that is if you like cleaning out soiled horse pens.  I didn't say good. The corn is kept in the background. And it's from Texas' oldest brewery, which isn't a brewery anymore but a restaurant with a gift shop surrounded by condos. What more could you ask for in today's global economy? Oh and the pearls!? if you look extremely hard you will see a few rising from halfway up the glass but if you're over 40 you wont be able to see them. This is a conflict of a beer, it starts off good (because you're thirsty for a beer) and ends real bad.\n",
      "This just tastes like a strong lager–not like an IPA. It does have more body than a lager. The taste is bitter, a bit flowery, and a bit soapy. No hops flavor at all.\n",
      "Pale gold with a fast-settling white head and a lemony nose. Sweet and vaguely beery. Cloying.\n",
      "Nie jest beznadziejnie! Kompletnie wygazowane, płaskie. W zapachu soczek jabłkowy, w smaku również ale kontrowany mocną goryczką. Jasne, słomkowe, klarowne, nie licząc braku gazu to nawet okej. Paskudne, ale lepsze niż ciemne\n",

      "Starts off with interesting notes - grapefruit as in the description - then about a quarter way down the pint, it turns into bog-standard Marstons and what little bean-counted Cascade hop they've used lies cowering beneath the sugar carpet. They've had to make it nearly five percent to compensate.\n",
      "I really believe some breweries are taking the piss out of Wetherspoons and dumping said piss on beer drinkers.\n",
      "So sweet it's making my teeth itch. All malt, no sophistication, no hops evident beyond the knowledge that they were used in the brewing process and then by an accountant. The description harking back to 1979 is spot-on, this is pretty much the corporate sludge we had forced on us back then. Whether Sid would have bovvered with this beer is unknown.\n",

      "440ml can sample.  Clear mid golden. Aroma of mild vegetable, apples and corn. Sweet malty Beer, with a little cloying note at the end.  Tastes like what a macro real ale brewery was pushing out as ‘craft’ 5 years ago.\n",

      "Can from chalet premier, nice place.  Smell is a little piney and yeasty. Pale yellow with a big foaming head.  Taste is almost IPA but it aint and fer sure its more than a golden blond should be, yes a rather strong bitter APA if you ask me. Its even a little volatile on the palate after each swig. Difficult and rather astringent for a Goldie, and for a blond? Would never pass scrutiny. Needs more manners.\n",

      "$5.99 bottle, TWSP. Clear rusty-pipe-water color with lots of bubbles but no head. Aroma is heavy honey, light floral notes. Flavor is honey, floral notes, dandelion. Sweet and almost artificial... like a cream soda or root beer in a way. EDITING TO ADD: I couldn't get halfway through this. Something grossly artificial and nasty in that flavor just keeps lingering. Dropping this score considerably.\n",

      "24 oz. can purchased at Total Wine in Denton, TX. Pours a clear light gold color with a fizzy white head and poor retention. No lacing. Lightly sour malts aroma. Similar sour-ish corn malt flavor. Light body. Mouthfeel like club soda. $1.50 per can and it tasted like it, but at least it's better than the Regal Brau Light.\n",
      "Bought from puddletown stores, bottled. Within throwing distance of brewery. Poured with a massive, soapy head that wouldn’t subside. Bland, kinda  flavourless and not really that easy to drink. Won’t be opening the second bottle unfortunately.\n",
      "Pours hazy reddish with a fizzy pink colored head. Aroma is sweet with fruity and sugary notes. Taste is bittersweet. Begins with sweet and sugary flavours of fruits and raspberry, slightly artificial rhabarber flavour too. Finishes with moderate sourness. Sweet and sugary, but still somehow  watery overall. I definitely prefer the Kinld Weisse without any sweeteners over this one. (Poured from a 0,33l bottle, bb 11/20)\n",

Tastes like any other crisp fresh IPA. Rude as all hell as with any well made ubiquitous IPA. Terribly rubbery chewing on rubber inner-tube mixed with sightly fermenting green grapefruit pulp all coated with spruce tree sap. Good thing it smells better than it tastes. Yes, just another on-style one of a quadre-quintillion other IPA's out there.\n",

      "I don't know what it is but Lincoln green beers always taste cheap and bland. Blueberry stouts seem very fashionable at the moment and I have tried some very nice ones, however this, like all other Lincoln green beers, is bland and boring. The blueberry taste is like one you find in a cheap sweet or ice cream and is probably a flavouring instead of the real thing and there is no other taste. I am from hucknall and know the brewery very well and this is typical of all their beers. Jump on the band wagon and sell as many as you can  while it's in fashion.\n",
      "Draft at the brewpub.  Very chewy, sugar-heavy malt is the dominate factor in my palate.  More of an Irish Red than something I'd label an \"IPA\" and lead drinkers to believe they're getting something hoppy by American standards.  (#7561, 10/2019)\n",
      "One of the most overrated drinks I've ever been recommended. It's extremely bitter and sour.\n",
      "This tasted like an IPA not a lager. Do not buy if you are looking for a balance of hops and malts. This has a bitter aftertaste and takes like citrus and pine. It's not bad for ....an IPA. I really wish brewers would label products appropriately. Maybe it was technically brewed using lager yeast but this is not the taste commonly associated with lager so it should have a disclaimer.\n",
      "A green can. Big bitter taste. Big foaming head on yellow clear beer. Typical IPA. Yes, so many of these and they practically all taste the same. May be one of the last IPA I try: No lie. Just can't get used to the terrible on style nature of these super bitter beers. How can anybody think real IPA is smooth light malts and easy to drink, come now.....\n",
      "330ml can: BB 6th Aug 2020, brewed in Belgium (at De Proef for beer 52). Drank at home on 2nd Oct 2019. Very pale urine yellow with a swiftly fading white head. Watery, bland, slightly bitter/bretty and boring. My first and hopefully last beer from the Mothership.\n",
      "Gleich mal ein rebellisches Design das viel gutes verspricht und ja so riecht es dann auch, eher muffig , im Geschmack unangenehm getreidig kratzig, da möchte ich nochmal aufs Etikett zurück kommen , Mittelfinger hoch für dieses Bier, oder is es doch nicht so schlimm? Keine Ahnung aber dieses rebellische steckt einfach an\n",
      "Cask gravity at Firkin Alehouse Folkestone.  Not so much a scream more of a screwed up face. Clear pure gold colour lasting white head. well it's in good condition. smells like fairy washing up liquid. tastes only slightly worse. finish is more fairy liquid washing up liquid. utterly awful.\n",
      "Sample courtesy of Grumbo. Thanks. Clear pale as water and without head. Aroma is sweet, sugary, earthy and apples. Flavor is quite sweet. Sweet finish. 021019\n",
      "Not dank, not a NEIPA, not really that hazy and certainly not an engine. But seriously, this is an awful beer.\n",
      "Another can of ubiquitous IPA? From cally none the less. Smells like, tastes like. Yes, stronger than most APA, definitely in the IPA strata. I think I even get a slight detectable warming sensation. Surprising. Taste is much stronger alky than 6%.  Yes, one big kick ass beer. However, I do sense a little welcomed cutting co2 in the finish. Smooths it out, just a little, heheheh. Definately more than a go 2 brew.\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2017. Clear pale golden with a thin white head. Aroma of light, with a little grassy hop, and mineral, earthy malt. Flavour is basic and the finish mildly metallic.\n",
      "Can on a plane. Slight grainy cardboard aroma with corn and skunky notes. Mild sweetish with low bitterness. Weak body. Lame.\n",
      "Sehr schnell zerfallende, feinporige Schaumkrone. Hellgelbes, etwas trübes Helles. Leichter Malzgeruch. Stark rezent und malzig im Antrunk, ebenso im Körper. Minimal herber Abgang mit leichtem Anflug einer Zitrusnote. Sehr süffiges Helles, aber auch nichts besonderes.\n",

Malziger Antrunk, kräftigerer, etwas stärker karbonisierter Körper. Minimal herber Abgang, der etwas muffig nachhallt. Etwas besser als das Durchschnittsmärzen, aber nicht süffig.\n",

      "500ml bottle @ monthly tasting, Chez Sophie, Sep 19, thanks Jeremy for bringing this back from your voyage through the British Isles. Pours dark mahogany brown, off-white foam. Aroma is malt-forward. Taste is tired ropey malt, thin and watery, amber bitter territory.. bit homebrewey, needs more dark malt to warrant the porter tag. \n",

      "I love strong IPAs, single, double, or triple, as well as potent porters and burly stouts.  Whatever this beer is, it is not an IPA.  It tastes more like rancid barleywine.  Utterly wretched, and one of the worst beers I've ever tasted.\n",
      "Bottle from friend. Pours yellow with a white head. Smells skunky as shit. Tastes a lot like Heineken in that it doesn't like much.\n",
      "Friends on a diet subject themselves to MU, so I tried one. Well, it is nice and bubbly and a head can be generated when pouring it from a can, though it quickly disappears with no lacing. There's a little caramel in the aroma. As far as taste, there is a grainy, sawdust-like dryness on the finish. I'll leave the rest in my beer fridge for their next visit.\n",

      "Can as pictured. Mild pine nose? Maybe.  Pours like a somewhat viscous pale ale. Thinner craggy head.  First taste is stronger APA effects, bordering into the IPA territory. They're attacking from behind by circling around the front! Bitter lingering longingly lasting thicker viscous mouth coating chewing on green grapefruit rinds IPA nastiness. Turpentine I say! No, just kidding, almost tastes like turpentine. Yes, a totally on style IPA; go figger. There, another ubiquitous mega-available IPA. IPA lovers, put this in yer bucket list. hehehehh\n",
      "Clear light brown colour, off white foam. Small head. Hardly any nose. Taste of black tea, herbal notes, malt. Dry and watery with little to no bitterness. Would have not identified it as an IPA, more like a brown ale. Failed as an IPA.\n",
      "Couleur pourpre rosée... aucune mousse. Nez très sucré sur les fruits rouges, un peu artificiel. Gout très sucré sur les fruits rouges bonbon et acidité pomme verte, sucré aspartame en fin de bouche. Vraiement pas agréable, ni un cidre....\n",

      "Really bad.  Not even a good aroma.  It has that \"rusty water\" taste associated with bad hops and/or OVERLOADED hops.  Hops?? In an Octoberfest??? A beer  KNOWN for its MALT??!!!  The label says \"golden lager\", but it tastes like a really bad czech pilsner.   The back label lists \"Bayerisches bier\".   This beer tastes like that Mex mess known as \"Modelo\".  I was surprised that this beer had such an ugly taste.  Ive had some bad Octoberfests, but this one pretty much takes 1st Place.  Congrats, I will never buy this swill again.\n",

      "Um.......no.  Horrible.  It had a good aroma, but then, the bitterness of the hops makes this MALT associated beer taste like what my dog left behind.  REALLY bad.  I was surprised.  I had heard so much about how \"great\" Ayinger beer is.  No.  Not this one.  Not a good example of an Octoberfest (known for its MALT, not its hops) beer.  I have 3 or 4 Octoberfest beers that are truly  GREAT  Octoberfests,  this isnt one of them.  A very poor attempt at this beer.  Try to stop adding hops at approx.  150 lbs. per bottle there dear Ayinger.\n",

      "29/9/2019. Can courtesy of Painy's travels, cheers! Pours clear bright gold with a moderate foamy short lasting white head. Aroma of corn, sweet malt, light tropical fruit, grass and a metallic edge. Medium to heavy sweetness, low bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, average carbonation. Sweetness increasing in finish,which was too dominant.\n",
      "Many thanks for this beer to Beerhunter111. Pours a hazy golden colour with a white head. Aroma and flavour of lemon, malt and straw.\n",
      "OK, another can of fricken sculpin for a tick, how many are there? Then on top of that there are a gazillion IPA out there? Doesn't anybody ever get tired of IPA and all the bastardized styles that are really IPA? Just asking. Clear pale in the glass with a big foamy head. I'm not sure why its called aloha because its just another fricken bitter IPA. So much bitterness, you'd never pick out what the aloha flavor was. Yes, nasty nellie negative norton, straight up ass nut sack. There you have it, just another ubiquitous IPA that wants to be an imperial IPA; tastes just like one. Finishes with a warming sensation going down the throat. Not pleasant, at least it doesn't smell like diesel body odor.\n",
      "Poured from can into nonic pub glass, a cloudy amber colour with sudsy white foam and lace. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Why anyone would want to drink this is beyond me. Smells and tastes exactly like I imagine drinking sunscreen lotion would.\n",

      "Can't believe I haven't it some words to this one.  Gold pour, large fast fading head.  Corn and faint ape aroma and taste.  Lighter body, sweet finish.  Works every time: but what it was setting out to do.... Your guess is as good as mine.\n",

      "12oz can pours out black topped with a oreo cream oil. Nose sadly is sour infection roast malts chocolate and coconut. Taste is more of the infected sour tart chocolate coconut bourbon barrels.\n",

      "So, I picked this sake up at a asian food grocery store that I go to regularly. I have tried several different sake varieties, in Japan and in the United States, although I would not consider myself an expert by any means. The bottle was nice, the price was decent, and I was excited to try a \"plum\" flavor sake. Unfortunately, this sake is really bad. Do yourself a favor and don't try it. It's major notes on the palate are of cherry flavored cough syrup, so don't buy it unless you enjoy that kind of thing because that is basically what it tastes like. Super disappointed because I had high hopes for it.\n",

      "Cask. Brewer's description: \"...clean...\" uh huh, it's so clean it's cleaned out. The smell is VERY slightly malty, the taste is MILDLY malty - and that's it. Not even the usual amount of filler malt that I always complain about. Doubtful that this brew has had any sort of hop waved in its direction either. Waste of money, time, taste buds. It's like drinking ghosts. Not even a beer for teenage trainee drinkers.\n",

Yes, its still all over the table and as I drink to the middle of the can I don't give a shit. Better go git a paper towel so I can redd this mess up, with a buggy and warsh cloth.

Little hop awareness, so the emphasis is on the malt, which is what I normally like, but as this is a pale lager, and the malt used is a pale biscuit malt with little character, and it has been fully fermented, slowly, it is dry, thin, and boring. Beers like this are drunk purely for refreshments, not for flavour, and not because they are doing anything interesting. The taste, such as it is, is more like straw and cardboard than anything else.

      "I was walking the pier, having a not so good day,when I stumbled across 13 guns. my mood was lifted instantly,until I opened the can that is. The smell instantly burned my nostrils causing my sinuses to flare up. I was shocked. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so I dived in head first to what was the worst experience of my life. I've been through a divorce that was smoother then this beverage. The taste of ass has been lingering in my mouth for 3 days now. Overall,wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Light yellow with a skunky lager aroma.  Flavor is crisp, bitter hops with a little sweet malt underneath.  Typical European hops taste with lasting bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "Golden orange pour.  Bordering on foul - industrial solvent nose and flavor,  hops in there somewherre but even though this was expected to be past it's prime at about 12 weeks old it wasn't just that, it was bad.\n",
      "Purs a pale yellow with a whte head the leaves lacing. The nose is slight cereal. Body is thin. Taste is sweet with slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  16 oz can\n",
      "33cl bottle from Mariusz, thanks!  A clear yellow colour with a white head. Aroma of sweet apple rings, sugar. Taste of sweet apples, sugar, lemonade, no beer.\n",
      "Can sample at a tasting at Tom L's place. Thanks Lior D. Clear straw color, white head. Lots of cooked vegetables, cereals, sweetish, slightly bitterish finish. Light-bodied.\n",
      "Cerveza comercial de aspecto y sabor muy aguado, sabor ligeramente dulce a caramelo.\n",
      "Maybe its because i let it sit in the fridge for 6+ months? The graphics on the can look better than this beer tastes.\n",
      "32oz crowler, clear gold, white head.  Nose is nasty, very sweet, heavy corn syrup and treacle, white chocolate, honey, just all sweet notes.  Flavor is the same, maybe worse; there's malt liquor and white chocolate, honey, treacle.  Sticky, cloying finish.  Woof.\n",
      "500ml bottle purchased very cheaply from Lidl in 2017 (or was it Aldi?).  Very bland, pasteurised bitter.  I mean, it’s not undrinkable, but it’s not really worth bothering with, even for £1 a bottle.\n",
      "Frothy white good mostly lasting head. Yellow colour. Light malty and hoppy aroma. Light bitter slightly bready flavor. Short finish. Watery palate. Not as bad as feared.\n",
      "Bottle sample at a tasting at Lior's place. Clear gold. Metallic aroma, a little worty, cabbage notes. Metallic, worty, vegetal taste, light body, vegetal finish.\n",
      "Pine and resin, some citrus, barely any malt. This beer is reminiscent of others in it's category; that is low abv IPA's, the overall body of the beer is lacking in malt flavor and bitterness while the taste of hops overpowers anything else worthy of attention. Not the worst beer I've had but definitely not good by any standards.\n",
      "From a Kroger can this pours a little darker than average pale and it seems to be quite thick. Big fruity rude aroma with a mild cleaning pine fluid nose. Taste is big bad-ass and bitter. BBAB! I second that with an upper gullet warming sensation. Its near the big ten; and you feel it. In the end, is it possible I detect some sensations of unthinkingly dizzy. Whew. What else can be said? One bitter straight up ass, terribly on style, IPA IPA  brew. There you have it, another ubiquitously available style, duh.\n",
      "Limonadiger künstlicher Beginn, der sich mit der Zeit verschlimmert. Dumpfe Bitterkeit, brotig, dass hier ein IPA im Hintergrund ist kann man nicht erkennen. Unnütz. 7/5/5/5/7/5\n",

      "0.5 bottle. This cider is one of the cider's. Nothing special.  Ciders on RateBEER....why???\n",
      "Poruing in slightly pale yellow or maybe green. Pure sugar with maybe some perries in behind. Sweet through and through which made spill it down the toilet. Maybe its just the style I dislike.\n",
      "Malt sweet aroma, not hoppy at all. Clear amber with a low white head. Unpleasant sweet taste. Medium body, oily texture & soft carbonation. Very far from an IPA.\n",
      "Canette 473ml. Couleur jaune pâle translucide, mousse blanche fuyante. Arôme de vomi. Goût de vomi, acidité moyenne-faible, semblant de goyave. Carbonatation faible, corps moyen-faible. Malheureusement, impossible de passer par-dessus l'odeur et le goût de vomi. Un rare raté de Lagabière depuis longtemps... Drain pour.\n",
      "0,6 l. Bottle. Golden color with white head. Malt aroma. Sweet, malt and alcohol taste\n",
      "0,5 l. Can from Vrutak. Golden color with white head. Malt aroma. Malt and herbal taste\n",
      "Can. Poured clear golden, white foamy head. Aroma of fruit, fruit juice. Taste was light sweet, watered down, bland, carbonated water, minimal to no watermelon flavor.\n",
      "Passible lager, wte   d  substantive glob of lager yeast. Not so drinkable.\n",
      "On tap at the source.  No smell. Gummy, yeast driven.  Nothing special.  Weak of a weak American pils.\n",
      "Pours clear, pale golden with a full, white head.  Aroma is corn syrup and light grass.  Taste is corn syrup, moving to light bitterness,  Finish is hoppy. Meh...\n",
      "Pale clear gold pour, head fades in a millisecond.  Corn, faint apple, grainy aroma, family sweet.  Not much taste, corn, light apple, grains, grass... Very sweet finish, bordering on cloying.  Light to medium body.  Thanks (I guess) Tones!\n",
      "This quad tasted more like a sour.  I couldn’t drink it!  It was the worst quad I’ve ever had. Just wasted $20.\n",
      "Tastes of barley, malt and a very small amount of hops. More of a pilsner flavor than a lager\n",
      "Canned, from Systembolaget.  Dark brown, small head. Aroma of well, oatmeal raisin cookie. Sweet with medium body and clean, sterile mouthfeel. Tastes like... Oatmeal raisin cookie. Low bitterness in a finish with some tin foil. Oh, the refinement. I've always dreamed of liquid raisin cookie in tin foil. And the complexity!\n",
      "Possibly the worst beer I've ever tasted. Actually gets worse the more you drink.  Tastes like what I imagine greasy dishwater does.\n",

      "Strawy, hempy smell of hops. Bitter and dry, a bit too dry for my taste. High carbonation.\n",
      "Not my kind of beer.\n",
      "440ml can, but 4 days out of date.  Murky dark brown. Aroma of dark malt and metallic notes.  Dark sugars in the flavour with damp malt.  Considering it had only just gone out of date, this beer was in a bad way.\n",
      "From a can you get a surprisingly clear liquid (considering the name, heheh) with a big foamy pour. It has just a very slight haze but no way is this hazy. No real offensive IPA smells in this one. Taste is big bad IPA of course and possibly it has a bit of an aged feeling to it. Date code is CMB1 9198 2361, whatever that means. Yes, big bitter IPA bullshit, like any other of the thousand ubiquitous IPA out there. What else can be said? NOTHING. Oh well, so goes the tick. Not impressed.\n",
      "Clear golden with a thin head.\n",
      "Strawy, hoppy smell. Very metallic taste with a malty finish. Mainly rather watery. Low carbonation.\n",
      "Zlatnozuta boja, bijela pjena srednje debljine, srednje trajna. Metalna aroma, veoma blago, skoro neprimjetno, arome trave i meda. Slabe gorčine, duzeg gorkog finiša. Vodene teksture, jake karbonizacije.\n",
      "Do nebe volající hnus, který jsem koupil jen tak ze zvědavosti, když jsem na něho natrefil v čadském Tescu.\n",
      "Cask at The Crown, Watford in 2012. Always was a naff Beer. Amber with a ring of white head. Aroma of sulphur, eggs, malt and raisins. Minimal flavour, with some grainy and mineral notes.\n",
      "Cask at the Kings Tun (JDW), Kingston in 2015. On paper this sounded good; the reality less so (although ‘Marston’s’ was a pretty big indicator). Hazy copper with an offwhite head. Lightest of peaty aromas; more sulphurous and grainy. Boiled sweets and apples in the flavour.\n",
      "Many thanks for this beer to Beerhunter111. Sweet aroma with lemons and lime. Sweet flavour with lemons and lime.\n",
      "Foggy gold body and okay foam, rotting armpit or maybe rancid lemons on the nose. Flavour is vague sweet hops overlaid with bitterness on the aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden, but other than that this one is a miss.\n",
      "Yellow pour with zero head. Aroma is odd and medicinal. Has a weird flavor of unknown spices. Kind of tastes like a Band Aid smells. Strange numbness on the palate. Little to enjoy here. Bottle.\n",
      "Clear yellow body and bleach white foam, about what you'd expect. Smells of rotting socks found in the dumpster behind your house. Flavour is sweet lagery hops, vague hints of booze and a cloying tinny aftertaste. Kind of what you might expect from this beer, though the alcohol is reasonably well hidden.\n",
      "Barwa złot, klarowne. Cienka piana, bardzo szybko znika z kufla. Smak rzygowin, kwas, nieco słodu, generalnie odpycha. Posmak kwaśny. Bardzo słabe piwo, jeśli w ogóle można to nazwać piwem.\n",

      "\"il solito\" al pub che frequento di più era la Beamish. Una birra che non ti stanca mai, leggera di gradazione, dissetante, ne berresti litri!\n",
      "Ottima stout Irlandese \"caffelattosa\", con schiuma spumosa (spillatura ad azoto).\n",
      "Per il mio gusto, superiore alla \"sorella\" ben più famosa e diffusa.\n",
      "Jesus this is bad. Not sure what discriminates this from their lager, taste very similar with harsh grainy notes, corn, acetaldehyde. Light bitterness.\n",
      "HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.\n",
      "Mildly syrupy, but not overly sweet. Woody and raisiny, if that’s a real word. Not your “traditional beer” taste. Sold by the ounce at Boxelder in Miami. Very interesting to try, worth trying, but personally wouldn’t try it again, not my style.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Lysegrågul. Filmskum. Litt uklar. Ingefæraroma. Smaken dorens. Kunstig. No good.\n",
      "Light caramel & corn malt, hint of lemon citrus hopLight sweet caramel malt, grain/cereal, and some citrus note. Light and refreshing but nothing special\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma : Lightly toasted caramel malt, grassy hop.  Taste : As nose, not horrible; just boring !\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good. No unwanted tastes or flavors that I notice. 15 pack for $14.50 before tax.\n",
      "Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.  Overall: too sour, too little going on, and I'm not convinced the cherries or poppies are doing anything.\n",
      "It's cheap ass hell and it does the job. I get mine at speedway for $1.80 That's including tax!!!\n",
      "very clear, light-yellow colour\n",
      "white foam that dissolves quickly and leaves little residue\n",
      "smells of hay, flowers—rose?\n",
      "tastes surprisingly like blossom honey—sweet, malty, floral notes\n",
      "oily mouthfeel, no distinct carbonation, lingers relatively shortly\n",
      "great beer if you’ve got a sweet tooth\n",
      "Pours hazy amber with a thin white head. Aroma of sweet lemon juice. Taste has sweet lemon with a hint of a wheat backbone, malt with light sour notes. Palate has intense nose note of lemon mixed with a honey sweetness. Notable.\n",
      "Cerveza de color dorado y fina espuma blanca al servirse. Con un sútil olor a lúpulo y sabor a malta tostada, naranja y frutas. Tiene un final  seco y amargo muy agradable al paladar.\n",
      "Colo amarillo pálido con una ligera neblina. Espuma desmesurada. Aroma a gaseosa y limón. Gusto a cerveza Pale Lager industrial de las baratas mezclada con gaseosa La Casera, notas de polvo y metálicas. Cuerpo acuoso. Esta cerveza es una auténtica estafa, sobrecarbonatada y desagradable, antes de pedirla piensa que una \"clara\" de Steinburg con gaseosa le va a dar 40 vueltas.\n",
      "Can: Gushed as soon as the top was popped, deep black with huge brown head. Aroma was vinegar fruit some roast, very pungent offness. Taste was undrinkable sourness, some molasses. Drain pour, which is unfortunate.\n",

      "0,3 litre Bottle from Old Cellar Collection. Golden with white head. Malts, hops, yeast, bitterness.\n",
      "Can from JRs. Pour is hazy pale fer sher. Rubbery nose. Same with taste, its kinda rubbery and floral at the same time. Yes, typical IPA, simply bitter bullshit. Rubbery finish too. What else can be said, its just another ubiquitous one of a million american IPA, there you have it.\n",
      "Feb 2020. Bottle at Frankie and Bennie's. Tastes like an old school alcohol free lager. Reminds me of Kaliber. Ho hum. Drinkable. I like the bottle label.\n",
      "Nice cider flavor, but the aftertaste threw me off. I would not drink again.\n",
      "12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Not sure why I bought a 12 pack of this ghetto beer. Was not expecting much and as is easy to believe, not getting much either! Nothing more to say other than sometimes a lightweight crap beer hits the spot.\n",
      "Silver can with a black label. Pour is very murky hazy IPA. It smells like IPA too, heavy perfumy and piney olfactory. Taste is big bitter obnoxiousness. Nasty, rude ass, totally in yer face. Go figger. Just like any other million IPAs out there except maybe its really hazy. Could not appreciate. Nothing odd about this. It looks OS finally caved to commercialism. This style is so ubiquitous and they all mostly taste the same. I gotta quit buying this happy bullshit style. Its noteven good enough for a tik.\n",
      "Orange can from chalet.  Not really a hazy IPA but rather clear. First taste is big bitter IPA, whew. Has a muted perfumy IPA nose. Lots of citrus on the tongue. Maybe I can find some hints of guava and passion fruit, but not much. Yes, lots of IPA bitterness, but good co2 for an IPA. Terribly on style, rude crude and nasty. Hey, IPA, I'm calling your name. I need to impeach this style, get it off ratebeer, heheheheh. Call in the witnesses; IPA is ubiquitous,the new cheap macro brew.\n",
      "Can from Hoptimism. Reddish deep brown colour with a thin head. Aroma and taste herby and fruity. tart. Not sure what squid ink adds? Crisp body.\n",
      "Can from Hops and Crafts Exeter. Pours slightly murky orange with a white head. Aroma of white grape ,onion ,wild garlic ,rubber plus some orange. Taste of of more grape,slightly burnt rubber,melon Plus a little orange squash . lightish bodied with a smooth lightly carbonated mouthfeel. The finish is slightly dry and bittersweet with more weak orange squash,grape,burnt rubber & sweaty groin. Can’t believe the charge nearly £8 for this ! AVOID unless you like pouring beer down your sink as this is a definite sink pour!\n",
      "Calidad y precio excelentes, semanalmente me suelo llevar 2 packs de esta cerveza ya que como digo, es barata y buena, si no eres un tikismikis o un lujos te encanta.\n",
      "Definitely bang for your buck. It’s cheap. Has a sweet taste to it. It will creep up on you with it’s abv. Have a couple of these and call it a night. Very refreshing. Cheers.\n",
      "My favorite cider. Pours golden color with fizzy white head. Lively big bubbles carry aroma of apples to your nose. Taste of crisp apples followed with bit of acidity and low sweet finish to it. Medium body texture with crisp tingling feeling on your tongue.\n",
      "Can from chalet.  Pour is clear and pale. Big white head. Smell is sharp floral IPA and so is the taste. Its terribly on style and it provides a kick. What else can be asked from one of a million ubiquitous, really effin straight up ass, on style  IPA? Go figger. Same as it ever was. Gimmie a smooth clean pale lager for a chaser please. I must say hover, its got some pretty decent co2 to set of the bitter terribleness.\n",

At least it don't smell like BO, thankfully. Yes, long biter bullshit, negative nellie, whew.  Who put hand soap in this stuff? heheh. Yas, so terrible, terribly on style. What else can be said except its just another ubiquitous IPA, not sure what beerdrinkers find in this straight up ass style.\n",
      "Bladozłoty, lekko zamglony. Piana słaba. W aromacie koncernowo, siarkowo, słodowo, ziołowo. W smaku koncernowo, kukurydza, gorycz chmielu i lekko sciągająco. Wytrawnie, nudnie, jałowo.\n",
      "Dåse: Lige efter en for gammel får jeg denne som bare er off. Duft af sur sæbe. Smagen er også sæbeagtig. Virker derudover gammel. Der er helt sikkert gået noget galt. Mærkeligt når det er en dåse.\n",
      "Tap at bowsers in monaca. I'm so tired of ubiquitous IPA and I'm especially tired of NB revamping the ranger by just slapping a new label on any ubiquitous IPA, quite rude. I'm done ticking these things they always taste the same, my immature taste buds cannot differentiate between these. Anyway, this is just another bitter IPA. Big stupid straight up ass insult to my lager loven taste buds. Whew, rubber chewing on inner tube long bitter finish as well. Just like any other terribly on style IPA, go figger.\n",
      "Tap at bowsers, thot I did this one already. A darker brew. Smells like some kind of sweet cinnamon cookies. Taste is flat and bitter with too much of that holiday spice thing going on, comes across as quite rude on the palate. Not good, just too much spices. Seems more like a medicine. Difficult to finish. Good example of a poorly made holiday brew, whew.\n",
      "Tap at bowsers. Pale  and it has a mild perfume hop nose. Very bitter up front with lots with lots of green grapefruit rind in there. Mellows out just a bit in the middle. Interesting. Not as bad as I thought it would be if that's any consolation.\n",
      "A very good Vanilla Porter. I like it just as much as Leinenkugel's Snowdrift. In a tasting they were both hard to tell apart.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 09/05/2007.  Crikey, I remember having a bottle of this some years prior, when it still had a peal off top, and don’t remember it being so bad.  This was simply a greAt example of terrible, pasteurised bottled bitter.\n",

      "Can. Semi opaque dark brown beer, small bubbly tan head. Thin and mildly dry palate, reasonable fine carbonation. Cereal streaked dark malts with a weird tea like twist. Thin dry finish. WTAF? Jaysus! Shocking!\n",
      "Same as coors banquet but less carbonated, not very bitter, nice and refreshing\n",
      "Pounder can from chalet premiere.  Lots of strong volatile boozy rubbery inner tube hops on the  nose. Cloudy off pale. Big thick head. Big bitter biting hops from the start, difficult and nastily on style, wheeeeew. Much more medicine than my lager lovin taste buds can handle. So big, so bad, so triple IPA. Thick and viscous on the palate as well as mouth coating like chewing on rude ass partially fermented pine needles ground up into green grapefruit rinds. One big ass kicking imperial experience. If you want to catch a buzz on one beer, this is the one for you as long as you can put up with its slick impact bitterness. \n",

      "Bottle at Delano Skyfall Lounge in Las Vegas, NV. Drank from the bottle. Starts out with some classic stout flavors and then the 11% ABV takes over and drowns out everything. WAY too strong to enjoy. Couldn't finish it.\n",

      "Quite simply the best lager I've had. A classic on draught or bottled. Excellent in a frosty glass in summer. Refreshing, tasty, almost perfect German lager.\n",
      "Bottle, twice by accident. Oh well... Dark fruit, chocolate, light vanilla, port wine. Unfortunately ridden with nail polish and booze. No body. It is beyond me how such an abomination was not called off from the market. Nail polish mostly. Ugh.\n",
      "16 oz. can, pours an opaque, murky golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma is very dirty, with lots of chalky yeast, dank hops... just very dirty. Flavour is brutal, with very dirty earthiness, chalky yeast, and dank hops. Rough and dirty. How is this rated so highly?\n",
      "Can. Marshmallows, pear drops, burned caramel, light milk chocolate, molasses, vanilla cheesecake, light solvent. Medium body, excessively sweet. Ridiculously over the top. Not enjoyable.\n",

      "Fra trefat på Manchester Beer & Cider Festival 2020. Spandert. Utrolig stygg. Ser ut som flytende sennep. Aroma av tropisk juice. Smaken mango. Stikkende.\n",
      "Une bière infecte.  Le goût d’alcool est trop présent.  Aucun équilibre. Le goût d’un bain de bouche.\n",
      "24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/10/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Thin but not too watery finish. Zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nice clean pale malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. Not too overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example.\n",
      "Acheté au marchè Dessaules à St-Hyacinthe. D’une grande noirceur, cette bière produit la plus belle mousse brune que j’ai vu jusqu’à présent. Celle-ci est peu persistante. Au nez, c’est évidemment très chocolaté. En bouche. le chocolat prend une énorme place, plus qu’à l’habitude même. Je perçois malgré tout un petit côté fruité rappelant la cerise. Il s’agit presque d’une pinte de lait au chocolat... J’ADORE. Beau travail du Grimoire.\n",
      "This is some rough stuff. Definitely not my thing. On the positive side, it's a very pretty beer. Deeply hazy straw yellow with a thick ice cream rocky head that leaves levees of thick lace. The aroma is pretty gross. Lots of cellar must, sea water, rotten grains., lemon, and hops. Flavors are not much better, and along similar lines but with a gym sweat and citrus fade.\n",

      "So, firestone's finally gittin round these parts. Its odd, because; right up the street we have the Firestone farms which is right next to the Firestone tires proving ground, go figger, you'd think somebody round here would have used the name first instead of some jokesters from the happy go lucky C state. This thing has a pour which is a somewhat hazy brew but probably not as muddy as a NE IPA should be. Maybe its all settled in the bottom of the can, heheh. Sharp IPA nose. Taste is what else? Its simply perfumy IPA all the way, I made a rhyme, gimmie a dime. At least it doesn't smell like BO or diesel. There, you have it; some kinda of IPA which is right in yer face, terribly on style.  What else can be said? Except its really hoopy hoppy bitter? Duh. Not impressed, this is so much just like so many other ubiquitous IPA's. There is a ton of these mahfahs.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 24/03/2007.  Just super grim.  All the worst things about pasteurised, overly sweet bitters, then amped up with (probably more brewing sugar) to get a totally unbalanced level of alcohol.  Tasted like 6% going on 60%.\n",
      "Har en del sødme men ikke ret meget stuotsmag. Den har lidt kaffenoter og en meget svag humle.\n",
      "Shorter stubby bottle. First taste is almost friendly fruity candy, with a bitter bite. Yes, somebody accidentally left the peels on these green unripened citrus fruits. Nice and hazy on pale is the eye. In the middle it starts to get unruly and sweet as well as perfumy, a little cloying. Yes, coconut and pineapple does not help here.  Yes, this is what seems to be an aged IPA turned into a fruity. Rude ass finish, fer sher. In the end it almost wants to be one of those holiday spiced beers. Did not enjoy, just a tick. Tropical its not.\n",
      "Bardzo obfita, średnio pęcherzykowa, dziurawiąca się piana z lacingiem, bielutka i stylowa. \n",
      "Wygląd również bez zarzutu, opalizujące, bursztynowe. \n",
      "W aromacie są cytrusy, są jakieś chmiele, bergamotka, winogrona, bardzo spoko zapach, gdyby nie to, że bardziej niż chmiele czuć słody i diacetyl. \n",
      "W smaku zupełnie puste, trochę owocowe, w stronę gruszki/winogrona, ale bardzo wodniste. Żadnej goryczki, wysycenie niskie. Raczej zlew.\n",
      "Served from 375 ml bottle in tulip glass. A thick tan had drops slowly with mild lacing. Color is cloudy copper-brown. Aroma dominated by vinegar with yeasty malt background. Mouthfeel is light to medium, extremely carbonated. Flavor is unpleasant vinegar and overwhelming tartness. Not picking up any typical farmhouse ale flavors with this. Overall: I hope the sample I had was off somehow, because I could not finish this beer. Just too sour and tasted like a glass of vinegar.\n",
      "Can at home. The beer poured brownish and was q quite malty., hoppy, tropical frui to me this was too malty for met\n",
      "A beautifully made beer, thirst quenching and very satisfying on the palate, well done Elgood's !\n",
      "It is what a German beer should taste like. A great beer to start with. German friends say it is an authentic German beer.\n",
      "Clear amber. Smells plenty of spices. Yes, even before I drink it, I'm alarmed. Taste is as expected, heavy on the spices, so much so you may not even be able to tell its a beer, except but maybe perhaps for the warming sensation that follows each slug down the gullet. Difficult downer, negative nellie, holiday hozer. Way to much personality for this lager lover. Oh well, its another dizzying tick. Medicinal finish. Not this one again. What's up with these overly spiced holiday brews? Who could luv these bastards?\n",
      "Flaska från livsmedelsbutik. Mycket och tunt skum. Sötaktig, fruktsmakande vätska. Ett slags vört-jos mer än ett öl.\n",
      "[email protected], Tampere, Finland. Compared to the original US produced version this is light years behind. Unbalanced, lame nuances of malts, overaged hops and some cardboard. Even not too unfiltered. 4 2 4 3 8\n",
      "Great balance, caramel flavors.  Not too strong.  I could have this beer all night\n",
      "I don't know if this is technically a pilsner, but regardless it's my favorite pilsner.  Perfectly balanced and very refreshing.  Exactly what you want from this type of beer.\n",

      "12 ounce can from Kroger Beckley, WV, 1/16/20. Hazy orange, thin creamy white head. Aroma of tart apple and apple cider vinegar. I think this is off. Taste is basically straight vinegar. Definitely bad. Sad.\n",
      "Tap (Euston Tap, London) (4:1:3:1:6=1.5)\n",
      "Ugly grapefruit juice look, a bit grey, and no head. Dirty aroma, yeasty, a touch fruity. Slimy palate, and dead in the mouth, I want to scrape my tongue. Horrid dirty yeasty taste. This is just trub, this is the shit you should have thrown away.\n",
      "Smooth, could drink on this all day watching football. Could be a possible Friday beer with the boys\n",
      "Not much of a Bohemian pils. Just some mash malt. Pours golden with ok head. Tangy cloying finish. Tap at Doghaus.\n",
      "Malty sweetness with pleasant bitterness that finishes crisp and clean. A Canadian classic, super easy drinking, and one of my favourite beers to sip any time of the year. Tried the unfiltered at the end of the tour at their brewery in Toronto, equally delicious!\n",

      "Keg at Man in The Moon, Stockholm.  Cloudy golden, small head. Restrained citrus aroma. Mid dry with medium body and clean, sharp mouthfeel. Notes of mango and chlorine. Sharp metallic finish with slight hop burn. Edges everywhere, flavors are scarce.\n",
      "Saint Archer Gold has a thick, white head, a clear, bubbly, straw appearance, and no glass lacing. The aroma is of sweet, musty grains, and the flavor is similar, with a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Saint Archer Gold finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT\n",
      "Medium to sweet, not sweet in my opinion.  For me this really hits the spot and has a light refreshing flavour with good, lingering appley after-taste.    (As a cava drinker, this also has perfect level of carbonation for me.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.\n",

      "Another straight up stupid ass beer from DFH. Got this from JR's in Rochester. Lots of alky for a couple of bucks, heheh.  Its virtually clear pale and I see its brewed with all kinds of happy bullshit; like apple juice, cinnamon and other fortnight beer additives, so be it, I'll give it a try, heheh. Creamy vanilla colored head. Make no mistake, this is another one of those awful spiced holiday brews, too much spice. Its quite rude but at least it is spiced to cover all its imperfections, just like the rest. You may simply  call it a Christmas  brew, it taste just like the rest; an insult to Christmas.  When are these beer companies going to jump off their high horse and try brewing some plain old good beer? Just asking. Yes, this is simply some way over the top ale, that has way too much spices in it. Get with it DFH, get back to your roots and quit chasing the money making niche of craft beer. You need to make just 12 really good beers. FORGETTAHBOUT all that happy bullshit. Get with it I say. Maybe you better go find some chemical analysis of some mummy's tomb and recreate the beer you think you found in the bottom of the sarcophagus. It just may be the chemical analysis of a dead body, no? Dead bodies are comfy in the bottom of a sarcophagus. They're moving on to some other better beer style.\n",

      "On tap at the magic tree in boardman.  Clear pale with a neutral nose. Not sure how these things can be called a stout, no stout attributes what so ever. Just a plain old pale beer as far as I'm concerned. White stout, that's pretty ridiculous! Disappointing to say the least. Get this thing off the stout train, stout it is not.\n",
      "750 mL bottle. Black. Smells of acetone, bourbon, wood,red wine, and berries. Tastes of straight vinegar. Vanilla tinge and bourbon soften it a bit, but mostly vinegar. Exceedingly sour. Dumped it.\n",
      "22 ounce, draft at Beef o Brady’s in Stow, Ohio. Smells sweet. Light golden in color. Thin white head. Asteroid sweet. Smooth and light. Sweet aftertaste. Just lawnmower beer to me. Cheers!\n",
      "22 ounce draft at Beef o Brady’s in Stow, Ohio. Smells sweet. Yellow in color and thin white head. Very light taste with sweetness and a little grain. Sweet aftertaste. Smooth. Lawnmower beer that I’m sure I will drink again. Cheers!\n",
      "500 ml can from a 2019 Advent calendar.  Pours a very clear gold with a nice white head.  The foam retention is good with nice lacing.  The aroma is very malty with no hop aroma which is proper for this style.  The flavor is also full malt, but balanced by a decent amount of hop bitterness.  This is a fine example of a Bavarian Helles Lagerbier.  Some are too sweet for me, but this one is not.  My only criticism of this beer is that at 5.0% ABV it is a bit strong for the style.\n",
      "Terrific beer !  I’m sure beer purists might be offput as its sort of like a beer crossed with an orange radler. But I think it’s awesome. I like sours occasionally but I find I really have to sip and savour them slowly as the flavour is so intense, this one is much mellower but it still has enough bite to be a little different .  Very drinkable . A bit like a an alcoholic san Pelegrínno with more of a tasty bite .\n",
      "When it comes to light beers nothing is even close to the “superior light beer”. True to it’s name it clearly is a remarkable. The amazing taste and smooth flow makes this beer quite the enjoyment. If it were not for michelob I would not be the beer concierge I am today. Michelobe makes every party go 0 to 100 real quick!! All hail michelob.\n",
      "Bottle, 6.5%. Hazy golden with small tan head. Aroma is malt, herbs, spices and perfume. Flavour is malt, spices, perfume, more spices, more herbs, lime, medium sweet and a little bitter.\n",
      "Four Peaks may be in my top 3 favorite breweries and they do not even sell in my state (Oklahoma), so I drive 2.5 hours to Dallas just to purchase it. This beer has some great IPA bitterness, it goes down with a warm finish and after a couple does quickly impact your decision making abilities.\n",
      "\"Pfister 6,6er Bock\", Flasche von Hopfen & Malz, Berlin-Wedding. - Die Brauerei Pfister hat leider die unschöne Angewohnheit, ihre Biere unter ständig wechselnden Namen auf den Markt zu bringen. Es gibt schon einen Ökobock und einen dunklen Bock, beide mit 6,6 %, und nun diesen 6,6er Bock - das ist wohl mehr oder weniger das gleiche Bier, wenn es auch von Jahr zu Jahr etwas anders ausfallen mag. - Kupferrotbraun, trüb. - In der Nase aromatisches dunkel-toastiges Malz mit unangenehm süßlicher, faulig-gemüsiger Note. - Antrunk für einen Bock geradezu wäßrig dunkelmalzig mit etwas Kakao, Kirschkonfitüre, Karamel, Traubenzucker und eigenartig ranziger Note. Milder rezent, hefeweich aber nicht bocktypisch breit; leicht schnapsig. Im Abgang milde aber angenehme herbale Hopfenherbe, leider überlagert durch die fatale ranzig-süßliche Note. - Mißratener Bock, nur mit Mühe genießbar. (10.1.2020.)\n",
      "This beer is like the go to game day beer, but when you want a top shelf selection. This beer has just the slightest bite to it with all sorts of flavor and aroma.\n",
      "Someone in marketing needs a raise, because they nailed this on the head when they called it a Wonderland. This is a bright and crisp peer with a nice mild hoppy flavor. If I was limited to one beer for the rest of my life, this is making the shortlist. The only thing I hate is that I have to drive 2.5 hours from Oklahoma just to buy it--which I do.\n",
      "If happiness has a taste, this is it. You cannot drink this and not enjoy yourself. The aroma, the taste, even the after taste, are all pleasant and enjoyable. This is in my top 5 favorite all time beers. It has a very refreshing taste that makes it worth the 2.5 hour drive every time I want to go buy it (Not sold in Oklahoma).\n",
      "This is literally one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. I am surprised the reviews don't have this at 5 stars. I have never given this to anyone that hasn't loved it. There is a light aroma with a full body and taste. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had.\n",

      "Stella Legere a go to for the intelligent beer drinker looking to reduce the waistline. The clean crisp flavour and low cab means the more you drink the more you lose. Stella is commonly referred to a the wife beater however the low carb version reduces the beating the ones that do get beaten throughly enjoy it though. Another 10/10 brew.\n",

      "Ugh, ugly cloudy pour, insipidly pale, sounded like Anna got a poop in her glass. On pouring, it's rich with pineapple and fleshy fruits, in the glass it's stankier, some carroty sweetness, and a bit of starch. Bland sweet starchy taste, stanky hops, fruity, some laundry detergent. Pleasant little bitter bite in the finish. All hops and starch, completely lacking malts. Alcohol is vaguely covered. Meh, a bit like that cloudwater muck, another brew for hazebros who don't like actual beer. Fucking shitty trub at the bottom of the glass. Gross.\n",
      "Not a huge fan of this beer. Far too sweet with a strange aroma. Underlying beer is lost in the flavor.\n",
      "Tap at mad mex in robinson.  Clear pale with decent co2 on the palate. Taste is somewhat bitter. It also is a little medicinal in the middle. Difficult near the end. Heavy hop citrus bite. Weird, dull & aged slaggy hop ending.\n",

      "Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.\n",

      "The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.\n",

      "This is a great session beers, the price was very good good. The beer is from a  local brewer in alcester, Fresh pint.\n",
      "I've not had a \"craft beer\" taste so much like Bud Light before. It was plain, kind of nauseatingly cereal-y, grassy, again plain, just kind of gross. Notes of overplayed beer pong. Honestly just bad. No effort here.\n",
      "It sure has nauseating amounts of vanilla. The vanilla is so strong and overpowering that it makes an artificial impression. Take the most pastry-overclocked pastry stouts that are in vogue right now. There is also a good amount of dark chocolate and coffee and a little bit of barrel notes, though overall it tastes like a cheap perfumy cheesecake in chocolate coating in the form of beer. Nah.\n",
      "Black pounder can from JR's. Typical beer smell. Clear pale with a big giant head, wants to overflow my mug. Rather flat but not quite on the palate. Seems a little rude with many ill ale attributes. Stronger attitude, alky shows thru with ease. Some astringent bitterness building in the back of the throat. A little thick and syrupy in the end. Not impressed. Finishes with that bitter astringent bite becoming prominent. Probably should be listed as an IPA, comes across like a weak, aged IPA.\n",
      "At £8.20 for a 440ml can I actually got a good price on this beer from Brads Beers in Rotherham indoor market. But I found it very regrettable. To me it tastes exactly like a swisher sweets chocolate cigar. Artificial and synthetically sweet.  Had it not been so expensive I would score it higher, but I was not impressed with this beer one bit. It tasted false.\n",
      "Ich weiß, dass viele Leute begeistert sind von diesem Bier sind, aber mir war es einfach zu brutal. Das Bier ist primär süß und alkoholisch, aber ohne feine Fruchtnoten wie es mancher Belgier hat. Hier fährt man wie die Iquisition mit dem Knüppel voll über die Zunge her.\n",
      "Es mag seine Sinnvolligkeit haben, dieses Bier in einem kalten Klostergewölbe zu trinken, um das fasten zu umgehen, aber im Vergleich mit modernen Bieren ist es einfach zu flach und brutal.\n",
      "19-Oct-19 (16-oz can, No date stamp: Purchased 13-Sep-19 for $5.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)This Imperial IPA pours a fully cloudy, golden-yellow body and an inch of bubbly, rocky, white head that settles to a partial dusting and thin ring, leaving a few spots of lacing on the beer-clean glass.  The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.  Overall, this is not enjoyable to drink.  It's harsh, astringent, very bitter, and tastes like eating garden weeds.  What an unfortunate first impression with this beer brand.\n",

      "Drunk in early 2019. Cocoa butter, green apple, ashy roast, molasses, coffee, light incense-like smoke. Almost no body, rough, astringent, boozy finish. One of the worst beers I have ever had, and that from an otherwise reliable brewer. Booze, acetaldehyde and ash dominate. What a waste.\n",
      "It tastes like someone put Mountain Dew and a bunch of Warheads in a blender. This is a beer where the first few sips come off as drinkable, but the overpowering sweetness and tang become too much halfway through the bottle. I like a good sour. This isn't one of them. Sorry Victory, love your other stuff...\n",
      "Can - decants a hazed gold amber with a 1 finger white cap....aroma is a soft musty, funky, woodsey with sub tones of toasted grains, very unusual but pleasant aroma...like dry hopped Hallertauer Mittelfrueh...delightful to my liking....flavor is very similar with lots of hoping but low bittering, decent malt spine...long smooth balanced finish with herbal-woody hopping going slightly bitter and a rich toasty character.... I don't know if the brewers intended this but this brew but these locally grown wet hops produce a very pleasant German noble demeanor...and that suits me because I love the cask aged German styles....2 thumbs up on this effort...one for the hop variety, one for the grain bill  - they click just fine\n",
      "Country Tick #100, Golden beer, small head. Aroma is malt, sweet, light grain. Taste is the same, some bitterness, nice.\n",
      "Can: salty, weird, not enjoyable. Rogue has lost it's mojo. Should go back to basics.\n",
      "Little can from Tesco, Watford and drunk on 20/03/2006.  Wow, it’s 9% and tastes 90%.  Really not quite sure how anyone could develop a taste for this, but it’s not only stupidly strong, but it’s straight up terrible.  Any discernible flavour is hideous and tastes synthetically sweet.\n",
      "Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back. \n",

      "Can from Wine Press, Beacon St, Boston. Malty, hay, flowery, citrus, fairly bitter. Low hop profile. Canned 24 Jan 19. Not fresh. Shouldn't be for sale.\n",
      "On tap at Kraftpaule, pours a filthy opaque yellow with a small white head. Aroma is characterized by lots of chalky yeast in typical incompetent hazy fashion, with moderate dank hops and stone fruit pith. Flavour is very filthy, with lots of chalky yeast, dank hops, earthy notes, and bready malt. So damn chalky and harsh. Exactly what I hate about this style.\n",
      "A bitter pint of stuff served in a Christmas selection because they can't get rid of it any other way. Tasted like wax mixed with turpentine, with a bit of hops for good measure. Not the sort of thing you should let your Nan buy you for Christmas.\n",

Very smooth to taste and subtle flavours of smokeyness with notes of dark chocolate and burnt toffee and vanilla. Not strong to taste considering it’s 7%!\n",
      "473ml can. hazed pour with a white soapy head. Aroma is similar to hefeweizen but boozy, banana, clove, gogurt. flavor is sweet, gogurty, no bitterness, this is trash for an ipa.\n",
      "Ok..... Firstly, 12 can pack for €12.49 !!!......... You can't go wrong. That's a whole weeks supply folks !!!\n",

      "Well done Lidl.......\n",
      "Can thanks to Drake. I've been advised I might not survive this one. Pours off-clear, few bubbles, no head. Looks like slightly dirty water. The smell is bad... copper pipe, plumbing issues, light pear. Aww. That flavor is awful. Old copper pipe water, very metallic, light soap, light pear. This is undrinkable. I concur: these people should be ashamed of themselves.\n",
      "Really tough to even sample this due to the mega attack of awful spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon to name just a few. Unbearable. Cough syrup.\n",
      "Japaneese people migh be proud of many things, unfortunately the beer is not one of those things, that's for sure!! The worse could be only a rainwater from a rooftop. Avoid it at all costs. They don't bother calling it \"masterpiece\".\n",
      "Generic aroma and watery taste, light color, fuzzy like a summer lemonade. Sad thing is that many  countries brew like this (now I am not talking about craft beer scene): Spain - Estrella, Greece etc. Did you try pilsner or some ale or any Belgian beer? Watch and learn boys.....\n",
      "Good old American blue collar beer. Perfect for after a hard day in the factory, in the fields, or on the construction site. Good taste and goes down smooth\n",
      "Malty aroma of the cellar. Malty taste of burnt malt. Light bitterness that fills the upper part of the mouth to a weak moment. Not so good beer. Follow me @ Kung av öl @ Facebook for more pictures and ratings.\n",
      "Malty aroma and taste of alcohol. Light bitterness that fills the upper part of the mouth for a moment. Non-drinkable beer. Follow me @ Kung av öl @ Facebook for more pictures and ratings.\n",
      "Not bad. Very easy drinking and smooth taste. The higher abv sneaks up on you a little bit but you could definitely crush a few of these. Overall very enjoyable. Cheers.\n",
      "Great lager. It’s wired in DC that I can’t find a place for a single beer instead of a pack. \n",
      "Take duck along with Sapporo reserve.\n",
      "Blik gedeeld door Tomhendriksen. Troebel geel bier. Aroma van citrusvrucjten; mango. Smaak van bitterlemon.\n",
      "Erg zuur.\n",
      "Can: Poured a pale yellow color Berliner Weisse with a medium size white foamy head. Aroma of fake syrupy notes with light tart notes. Taste is a mix of also fake syrupy notes which resembles Napolitano ice cream with some gross sugar notes and a tart finish. Body is light with good carbonation. Experiment gone wrong.\n",

      "One of the six beers I got for Christmas this year. I started with the gas because it's the one I know I'm not going to like him. Never like any other beer and I've had in this while I'm not a big fan of salt. average white head on top of a an opaque gold and brown body. I'm not going to lie here, it smells like salt. With the coriander and the sea salt and taste like I'm drinking liquid seasoned salt. If you like this style you might it's probably good but I don't so this is probably one of the worst beers I've ever had.\n",
      "Bottle from Tesco’s, Watford and drunk on 01/12/2005.  Made the error of not chilling this more, although as an English ale, you wouldn’t have thought it would need it.  Just way OTT on the Christmas spice.  Pretty unpleasant.\n",
      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 30/11/2005.  I don’t know what it was with this beer.  Admittedly, I know that Burton water has a higher level of sulphur, but most times I had this beer, it had such a discernible nose of rotten eggs.  Occasionally, this would spill over into the beer, which would also taste eggy.  Could never work out why people drunk this.\n",
      "One of the best lagers i tasted so far. light pale yellow, nice and fresh hops, very tasty and good after feel.\n",
      "This beer has always gotten an undeserved bad rap mostly because it's price lends itself to first time drinkers who abuse it and themselves. Early marketing proclaimed it as the \"beer with the taste for food\". And that is how I discovered it with a friend serving it along with hot wings.  Thirty-five years later it is still a beer you will most frequently find in my fridge. To me it is better than and certainly no worse than Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light. Beers that my neighbors and friends stock their fridges with. You won't see flashy ads on TV for Natty light, but if you think that extra couple of dollars you have to pay for those previously mentioned brands is because of better taste/quality, you would be mistaken. In fact, I did a blind taste test with a group of neighbors a couple of summers ago and Natty Light won with 2 out of 3 of them. Hardly \"scientific\", but evidence that perception/reputation is more powerful than reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of more expensive beers that I also enjoy very much (Sam Adams Summer Ale, Terrapin Hopsecutioner, Harp to name but a few), but you are far more likely to find Natural Light in my fridge on a given weekend and I make no apologies at all for it. Especially not to someone holding a Miller Lite.\n",

      "Not very good. Bright spicy kind of bitter espresso bean flavor is present as is a mild sort of skunky peanut butter background aroma. Mostly just a straight coffee-tasting light bodied sort of bitter brew that doesn't have much well-roundedness as I'd like from what should be a creamier contribution or a sweet rounding out of flavor from the peanut butter or chocolate.\n",

This was total adjunct flavour and tasted like I had a mouthful of apple flavour Moam sweets and then took a swig of Greene King IPA before swirling it around in my mouth for a bit.\n",

      "Man, this could have been great.  A tiramisu-inspired beer?  Why oh why wouldn't you put that on a stout instead of a Belgian-style.  The result was a watery brown mess that lacked the heft and sweetness you'd want from a true tiramisu beer.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.\n",

La seconde bouche révèle des notes de raisins secs, d’amande amère, d’alcool et une belle amertume qui dure pour une finale longue et rafraîchissante. Une puissante bière de garde !\n",

Medium body, veryperfumy and then dry to an extreme defgree where astringency sets in. I very much doubt that this is what was intended. It doesn't taste like maple at all and it's so astringent that it's like chewing painkillers. Misfit, sorry. 201219\n",
      "Dec 2019. 330ml dark bottle, unfiltered, from Beer Hawk's £1 a beer deal for out of date beers - this one is best before 20/11/19. It's an odd thing. Flavours all over the place. There's the zippy hops, and there's hazelnut, vanilla, and coffee. And somewhere in all this there's a pale beer trying to get out, but it's hidden beneath all the flavouring. Does anyone remember the Kitchen Sink Brewery? A British small brewery that tried all sorts of ingredients in each beer - everything except the kitchen sink, really. This reminds me of that.  [2.0]\n",
      "This is not a cider I would never drink again. Artificial sweeteners in cider is a disgusting idea. It doesn't need artificial sweeteners added, it will be sweet enough WITHOUT the artificial crap.\n",

      "De Landbierparadies. Jugando a Adventure Pals. En copa hefe de Bavaria. Maltosa, con un buen cuerpo y compensada con una reseñable dosis de amargor herbal que hace que pronto te encuentres deseando bebertala de un buche\n",
      "Bottle. Clear golden color. No head. Sweet, malty, alcohol, acetone in aroma/taste. Nooooopeeeee.\n",
      "A surprise find in the basement of Shinkong Mitsukoshi, opposite Main Station. Aroma: malty. Appearance: clear light brown, 5 mm. off-white head. Palate: medium-bodied and slick, malty and sweet at the finish, soft carbonation. Taste: medium bitter and sweet, not particularly well-balanced; ginger nuts, petrol, unpleasant.\n",

      "bottle share from a new friend at Tenaya. I could not stand the smell. super sweet pecans with acetyl butter. made it difficult to really enjoy the beer. the worst one-off in thi series by far for me.\n",
      "Another \"infected\" BBB variant!!! Drain-pour! Will not be buying anymore of their products. There are so many other great BA Imperial Stouts, for much better price.\n",
      "C’est une bière très bien équilibrée. Clairement, c’est un opéra dans le verre et dans le gosier. Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.\n",
      "Le goût est riche et très équilibré, ce qui fait monter la côte de cette bière dans mon coeur. Cet équilibre se trouve dans l’entremêlement du malt, du houblon et de l’alcool. Cette richesse de gout s’équilibre également par la mousse, dense, qui rend de la douceur a l’ensemble. En arrière de cette équilibre, on retrouve les notes fruitées que l’on sentait au départ. Ce goût et surtout cet équilibre se prolongent tout au long de la dégustation.\n",
      "La bière est bonne, très bien équilibrée, le dosage est parfait. Simple à boire, elle a le gout de la bière (meilleure analyse du monde). Enfin d’une bière qui se laisse boire facilement et qui ne se veut pas forte et riche en gout. Nous avons un malt et un houblon assez jeunes qui laissent ce côté fraîcheur (chill) qui me plaît de plus en plus dans la bière.\n",
      "En bouche, cette bière est assez douce. Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.\n",
      "\n",
      "A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.\n",
      "Dès la première gorgée, elle se savoure. Elle est très bonne d’entrée de jeu et c’est bon signe ! Le houblon est bien présent et elle est très fruitée, puis, le malt arrive en fin de bouche. Un goût complet et équilibré. En plus, elle est belle (« Vous avez vu ma femme ? Elle est belle hein ? Oui chef »), avec sa mouche bien blanche et plutôt dense pour une blonde. Au long de sa dégustation, accompagnée de la socca de René, évidemment, elle se montre légère et idéale pour accompagner la recette qui l’a inspirée !\n",
      "Ce qui frappe d’entrée de jeu avec cette jolie blonde est son amertume. Elle est très présente, ce qui lui confère beaucoup de caractère. Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.\n",
      "\n",
      "En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans. Et, ce petit goût floral vaut le détour.\n",
      "\n",
      "On doit aussi noter qu’elle fait pas mal de dépôt, c’est bon signe : on boit de la vraie bière, pas pasteurisée et compagnie !\n",
      "Vous le sentez ? Moi oui ! C’est le goût de la bière qui coule dans la gorge et la volonté qui reviennent. Revoilà cette sensation de fraîcheur, ses fines bulles qui pétillent telle une Badoit un jour de grand soif. Une résurrection. Tel le phœnix renaissant de ses cendres. La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble. On distingue la présence de blé, qui enrobe le tout. Et sur la fin, on remarque l’amertume typique des levures ajoutées à la mise en bouteille.\n",
      "Pas besoin de vous faire un dessin, je la recommande. En ce moment je suis plutôt lassé des bières belges trop lourdes et fortes; mais en même temps, la radler c’est un peu light. Là, c’est le juste milieu.\n",
      "Et ben c’est une super bière! Pour une bière de garde elle est plutôt douce, dû à son manque de houblon, mais c’est bien compensé par le goût de l’alcool.\n",
      "La première gorgée apporte également une légère odeur de mangue mais la sensation de douceur s’efface et est remplacée par l’alcool, que l’on sent bien en arrière-goût et qui perdure mais sans être agressif. On retrouve donc bien une bière de haute fermentation. Les gorgées suivantes apportent de nouvelles touches, de petits arômes qui se dévoilent au fur et à mesure. On trouve donc des goûts de caramel et de réglisse qui se cachent derrière la note principale de malt.\n",
      "La mousse bien épaisse donne une superbe entrée en matière et quand on arrive au breuvage là c’est le pompon ! D’abord la puissance des céréales puis on distingue des notes de caramel. Elle reste peu sucrée mais l’alcool reste discret\n",
      "C’est un peu complexe pour distinguer l’ensemble de ses saveurs, mais même pour des novices dans le domaine, elle se laisse apprécier. Son petit plus :  le sucre est rajouté à la mise en bouteille, ce qui permet de réactiver les levures. Là, comme ça, ça ne vous parle certainement pas mais ça veut dire que c’est une bière qui peut se conserver très longtemps et qui aura même tendance à changer de goût pour devenir encore plus puissante (et aussi avec un plus gros taux d’alcool).\n",
      "c’est une bière d’exception à boire exceptionnellement pour la savourer pleinement et toujours (re)découvrir ses nombreuses saveurs. Ses multiples facettes font qu’on en boirait bien plus que la bouteille\n",

      "A première vue, on sent ces levures. Elle se révèle assez maltée d’une part mais rafraîchissante, bien liquide de l’autre. En cette canicule ce n’est pas désagréable !\n",
      "Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.\n",
      "\n",
      "En bref, vous pourrez vous vanter de faire découvrir une bière intéressante, rafraîchissante et complexe !\n",
      "Seriously ? Only 3/5 for any reviens WTF DUDE\n",
      "\n",
      "Inbelievable french beer !! With a guide on LANGRES, we discovered this awesome beer !!\n",
      "INCROYABLE ! Visuellement, cette bière est opaque pour une blonde, et bien que l’opacité laisse présager une bière forte, typée bière d’abbaye belge comme la Triple de Val Dieu, mais il n’en est rien et elle est même légère. Au nez, elle se révèle houblonnée.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finalement, c’est un bonne bière, rafraîchissante, mais riche en goût ! Je me répète mais c’est un tour de force.\n",
      "C’est frais, c’est bien malté. C’est puissant. On est bien sur une Bière de Garde. Mais tout est harmonieux. Avec même des notes d’agrumes et de fruits frais. Clairement surprenant pour une blonde. On pourrait la boire en terrasse, les pieds dans l’herbe avec le soleil tapant sur la tête. Par contre n’oubliez pas votre chapeau!\n",
      "Comment dire. C’est Simple. Genre vraiment simple. Mais très efficace. L’exercice est parfaitement réussi. C’est une blonde tout ce qu’il y a de plus basique. De fines bulles, un parfum de céréales et un goût de malt frais très agréable en bouche. Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer. Toutefois les finitions ne sont pas les mêmes. Ici, on est au volant de l’allemande.\n",
      "En la versant dans son verre on est surpris par la quantité de mousse qui se forme et surtout sur sa texture, puisqu’elle est dense et persiste assez bien.\n",
      "\n",
      "La première gorgée attaque par les arômes de céréales, en particulier l’avoine qui surprend. Rien d’étonnant si on a lu l’étiquette et qu’on sait ainsi qu’elle est faite à partir de trois grains, le froment, l’orge et l’avoine donc. Cette première gorgée est forte et les qualités de la bière sont difficiles à  distinguer, mais passée cette étape, elle devient bien plus douce et on peut apprécier tous les subtilités de ses arômes, assez uniques.\n",
      "Excellente bière ! Je m'en délecte chaque week-end. \n",
      "\n",
      "Texture somptueuse et je crois quelle fait l'unanimité\n",
      "ATTENTION !! Biere de GARDE !\n",
      "Il s'agit d'une bière qui peut se boire en pression... MAIS qui se boit après plusieurs mois de fermentation dans sa propre bouteille!\n",
      "\n",
      "En effet elle est fermentée dans des fonds de bouteille de champagne puis verser dans leurs bouteilles respectives. Leur goût est donc évolutif et pour avoir la VRAIE biere de garde il faut impérativement la boire 6 mois après voir plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vous comprendrez les notes lorsque vous aurez fait ça ! Elle est INCROYABLE\n",
      "Smooth and with strong hoppy flavor. Is it an ale or a lager? Strong and a good value for its low price. Better than the watery choices that cost a buck more than it\n",
      "12 oz. can from Total Wine-Viera. Pours a dark brown color and mahogany highlights with a thick creamy light tan head and great retention.  Spotty lacing.  Very coffee-forward aroma. The taste matches the nose.  Dark roasted coffee and creamer flavors dominate. Any other flavors are drowned out. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation combine for a creamy texture. If you like coffee this would be really good; I dont.\n",
      "Worst beer I've ever encountered. So disgusting it could be counted as a weapon of mass destruction. Every reputable brewer or beer lover will drop dead (literally).\n",
      "Je n'ai même pas envie d'écrire un commentaire tellement elle est insipide et sans intérêt\n",
      "Ohhh Mickey’s.. I can’t count how many darkened days and sunny nights you’ve gotten me through. You truly are the FINEST of malt liquors.\n",
      "Best beer so far and by far! \n",
      "I tried so many other beers and I'm not saying that they all bad but the STEEL RESERVE is by far the best! I like the full aroma, great taste over all! \n",
      "The perfect beer for somebody who likes it a bit heavier and hoppier!\n",
      "355ml bottle, drank on 15th  Dec 2019 while in California. Clear and clean amber body, plenty of carbonation bubbles rising through but no head what so ever. Sweet pumpkin aroma and taste. I am no expert on Pumpkin ales, but this is by far the worst I have come across; just awful.  Too sweet even for my sweet tooth.\n",

      "Not sure there are any taste notes. Will not buy again thin yellow not appealing to this drinker, the bad chinese food I bought today to go with it is a good match. Glad I just got 1 can\n",
      "When I am king, citrus adjuncts will be outlawed. This travesty will be first to face the block. Disgusting sour fizz. Like Tango sans the sugar.\n",
      "UGH!  Horrid stench of weed, skunk behind, and fusel alcohol.  Might be the worst smell I've ever had of beer.  Tastes like old eggs, bad herbal funk, and some mango in the finish desperately trying to save it.  Two sips and...just no.  Drainpouring this.  I haven't had an especially bad beer in awhile, but this was just AWFUL.\n",
      "I'm so tired of these hero beers, they all pretty much taste the same so here goes another. I suspect it will be some totally bitter thicker hopped beer, as usual. This can was only a buck and a half at vintage. On pop there is lots of hops permeating the area. Clear pale. Taste is mouth coating veggie hops with decent co2. The co2 is a positive considering how hopped this IPA is. Bitter linger on the sides of the tongue after each big swig. Pretty big impression on the hops, you'd swear its above 5% fer-sher. Why would anybody want to subject their palate to hop bitterness without much alky kick? Just asking.\n",
      "What a disaster. Watery toffee taste. Is this beer or is this a wanna be?  Disappointing\n",
      "First off. These people are off their rocker. This is excellent beer. Pours up a crystal clear golden color with a small bubbly white head. Clean clear honey malt apple aroma. Taste follows with a clean clear straight forward malty taste. Honey like sweetness. Mild spice and cleansing apple. Amazing.\n",
      "This “root beer” doesn’t taste like a root beer. It tastes like a sparkling dip cup. Honestly, the wintergreen is so strong, it was incredibly reminiscent of Skoal Wintergreen spit. Would not recommend to anyone. I poured the entire 6 pack out after one sip. Wouldn’t gift to people I hated. Would give 0/10 if I could.\n",
      "Har svårt med imperial porter. Men god rund smak i början och sedan kommer ”sprit” smaken. Men väl balanserad och det låga betyget beror mest på mitt tycke för imperial porter.\n",
      "WinterBrew has a medium, khaki head, a clear, red-brown appearance, and some lacing. Aroma is of dark-roasted malts, bread crust, and syrup. Flavor is of brown bread crust, raisin, date, and possibly figs. Mouthfeel is high medium, and WinterBrew finishes surprisingly crisp. RJT\n",
      "(Keg at Brewer's Republic, Colorado Springs; 2 April 2018) 4:3:4:2:7=2.0\n",
      "A hazy or at least very misty reddish beverage with a sweet aroma that has something almost lemony to it.  Oh, and there are sweet fruity old socks, in the taste too.  And yes, I get harsh booze, which is the main characteristic of the finish, alongside caramel.  This is not a barley wine.  Unusually, Phil didn't have this.\n",
      "This beer pours a clear straw yellow color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is wet hay and roasted barley malts. The flavor is roasted barley malts and water. The mouthfeel is very light with lots of prickly carbonation. Not a complex beer but an easy drinker for sure.\n",
      "Allow me to retort: Jager through and through, with an unbearable amount of star anise overpowering every other aspect of the beer. Add a little honey and you’ve got fizzy Zarbee’s cough syrup. Intriguing, unique, remarkable, and absolutely undrinkable.\n",
      "recalled enjoying this before so bought again.had it after  tripel, aventinus and strong cheese\n",

      "Just like the original, I just don't get this beer.  It has some peanut butter flavor, but also tastes just dirty.  The color is fine but the flavor is just bad.  Don't get the love.\n",
      "Goldene Farbe mit leichter Trübung. Viele kleine Kohlensäureperlen. Geruch nach milden Zitrus und milden Hopfen. Mittelgroße cremige Schaumkrone. Im Antrunk recht erfrischen mit angenehmer Malznote. Kohlensäureanteil ist ausgewogen. Samter Hopfen bzw. Zitrus, Frucht Körper. Ein Pils mit einem super Verhältnis. Mein Lieblings-Pils.\n",
      "Groen gekleurd bier met veel wit schuim. Van het bier is qua smaak niks over, de waldmeister is daarvoor te overheersend. Het bier smaakt super zoet en heeft een vreemde kruidige smaak. Echt niks voor mij.\n",
      "clean and edge also great flavor.drink with a pringles or another salty foods as popcorn or nachos or KFC,pizza. salty flavor is best option for MGD in my opinion. but end flavor is not that much good.\n",
      "Bock is not my thing. Even don’t have the desire to finish it. 1/3 of the beer left in the glass. Seems like begging me to drink it.\n",
      "Light yellow pour, white head. Sweet at first, mild bitterness, dry finish.\n",
      "Extremely strong beer. Tastes like a DARK fruit that's a bit overpowering. Wouldn't buy again.\n",
      "This was very disappointing. I had hoped for a luxurious chocolate porter. This isn't it.  It lacks the depth of a classic porter. A very one dimensional ale with a very, slight hint of chocolate, certainly not the hit of deep chocolate that can work so well with a complex porter or stout. I should have read the ingredient list.  The glucose syrup would have warned me that that was probably a watery, indifferent attempt at a  chocolate porter. Shame on me.\n",
      "This beverage can make you feel as happy as waking up on Christmas Day. The sound of childrens laughter washes over you as you crack open that beautiful can of joy. It is the taste of a good session and the pride of a nation. Galahad truly lives up to its namesake at the round table.\n",

      "Cette nouvelle recette est parfaitement équilibrée. Savoureuse en bouche, elle apporte un très léger parfum d'épices, de caramel (mais sans être sucrée), et se boit avec un vrai plaisir. Elle n'est vraiment pas trop forte et, mieux encore, on retrouve ce petit goût métallique (mais agréable) en bouche, caractéristique de la Choue.\n",
      "Absolument délicieux et captivant parfum. Mousse compacte et en bonne quantité (un nuage moelleux comme une couche homogène de neige, douce et lisse). En bouche, un goût de malt exalté, et très savoureux, avec une densité élevée.\n",
      "En bouche c’est une saveur intense composée d’épices et de caramel qui se dévoile, s’apprécie. Un mariage équilibré de douceur et d’amertume.\n",

      "Purchased a six pack of cans from a Wal-Mart. Thick white head on top of a clear golden body. Well not so clear, but not hazy either. The beer smells overtly of vanilla, and nothing much more. It taste of vanilla, mostly like yellow cake. I have to admit this is probably the best beer I've had this year that I'm trying for the first time\n",
      "J’aime boire cette magnifique bière entre kheys pendant des irl, ça m’apaise, j’aime ça\n",
      "Bottle.  Pours a clear gold color with a thick off-white head and great retention.  Very good lacing.  Strong hoppy aroma.  Very strong bitter flavor. This is for serious hop heads only. Not my preferred style. Yes, I'm not worthy. Haha.\n",
      "Biere incroyable qui n'a de défaut que son apparence ambrée magnifique pour laquelle je tuerais, sérieusement cela me fait tellement craquer que je pourrais défourailler tout le monde dans un bar où je m'attablerais  dans l'espoir de déguster ce cadeau divin du chef, ce qui est un assez gros défaut vous en conviendrez\n",
      "This beer smells absolutely terrible. Tons of grapefruit and assloads of gym sweat, onions and rotting sea life.  Lightly tart flavor with plenty of bright grapefruit,  tart lemon,  and gym shorts. A bit of a salty tart finish.\n",

      "Meilleure bière que les leffes que l'on nous sort à toutes les sauces. Cette bière est incroyable, ce goût en bouche a réveillé mes papilles de mâle alpha.\n",
      "Very Good Beer if it's not the best. Smooth & Tender @ the beginning of 24 Fl. oz. Slowly tastes getting boozy, sweeter & strong alcohol @ the end. I'm sure I would enjoy it for a long time.\n",
      "Optisch echt super, riecht aber als sei ne Flasche 47/11 übers Sofa gekippt. Zimt und Rosenwasser, holla die Waldfee. Im Trunk ebenso abenteuerlich, schwer zu glauben, dass das ein Stout ist.\n",
      "Aroma of diesel and BO, nasty nose.  Clear pale. Taste is not as bitter as expected but it starts to get more bold in the middle. Yes, now I'm thinking its not as rude as was expecting. Better than most IPA because I don't like IPA. In the end, its probably more like a stronger APA.\n",
      "750mL bottle, pours a filthy dark mahogany brown with a small tan head. Nose has some butyric, with toasted caramel and bready notes. Flavour is horrendous, with lots of butyric, paint thinner, alcohol, and perfume. This is fucked up in every way conceivable. Undrinkable. Nasty.\n",
      "Can, pours a clear piss blonde with a small white head. Nose is full of artificial fruit - wow is that bad. Flavour is so artificial, with lots of fake strawberries. Revolting stuff.\n",

      "330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 10/2020. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon juice/pulp, lime, citrus peel/zest, wheat, cracker, and white bread dough; with lighter notes of banana, bubblegum, clove, wood, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lemon juice, pale/wheat malts; and light-moderate fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop notes; with big strength.

Lingering notes of tart/tangy citrus juice/pulp/peel/zest, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, banana, bubblegum, clove, wood, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of lemon juice, pale/wheat malts; and light-moderate fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness and tart/tangy fruit balance; with no astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitter/tart/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky/acidic/tangy balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Overall this is an outstadning NA radler style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of lemon juice, pale/wheat malts; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/spicy/tart/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery at all. Perfectly balanced between weissbier and citrus juice flavors; solid hops presence/balance. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A highly enjoyable offering and amazing style example. Best NA beer I have had.\n",

      "\"A restrained yet present bitterness\" The restraints need double checking because this ones escaped and causing havoc. The description mentions orange zest but all I'm getting is grapefruit. The flavours are thrown together and are at war with each other on the palette. If you like grapefruit and bitter, sour flavours then you'll look on this one much more favourably but for me this was hard work to finish\n",

The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity.

This was one of the only beers claiming to be dark. grabbed it on a whim. extremely light roast notes dominated by C-HOPS, bitter, overly carbonated. I dumped it because it was the opposite of what i wanted to drink at the time.\n",

      "A nice easy drinking session lager. Perfect for a warm climate like Australia\n",

      "Typically the same taste as all other IPAs, but I gave it a shot. Awesome look, good smell, but not such a reflecting taste I could appreciate.\n",
      "Refreshing and excellent, let me set the scene. A long day of work, you come to your fridge to have a quiet night in, and the G'had stares you back. After a first sip of liquid gold runs down your throat, the sensation of the worlds best premium lager kicks in, with a rustic taste and a sense of \"bring the outdoors in\", a well rounded refreshing beer.

      "Nov 2019. 330ml dark bottle from BeerWulf for less than £2. Urgh, this is not my thing. Mucky murky hops and malt - everything blurry and blurred. It's like drinking a mess. There's ingredients here, but they don't combine to produce anything meaningful or pleasant in my mouth. Each to their own, but this presents as a mess to me. It's drinkable, but its not the best.\n",
      "Purchase a 12 pack from my local Rite Aid. Thick white head on top of a pale yellow body. It's really bubbly. It smells sweet, kind of like sweet corn. It's a touch on the dry side but otherwise it's a perfect lager. it's slightly sweet with no hoppy bitterness there's a slight aftertaste I find unappealing but other than that a fine beer\n",
      "Golden, small, aroma is malt, grain, sweet, bit of sweaty feet, taste is malty, sweet, grain, heineken. Meh\n",
      "The black knight they called it. I’d heard the stories, the townsfolk warned me but destiny will determine your fate one day. It was darker than dark, I stared into my glass like the abyss it was and the abyss stared into me. Had a roast nutty finish without hints of citrus, head was minimal but present. I’ll never remember the ml but I’ll always remember how I felt that day.\n",
      "Pours a clear pale yellow with a white head. Very light grainy aroma. Light sweet rice and grain flavors. Pretty plain and ordinary. Ok but nothing special.\n",

      "Hahah, name on this $2 bottle makes me want to pop it and chug it. Well, here goes. One big giant chug from this 60F bottle is decent. Poured rest into a mug. A fancy mug yet it has a clear side for viewing. Some off aroma in the nose. Quite a blast. Pretty good carbonation with some ill ale effects but it never tries to be an IPA and I'm glad about that. Next to tap, a craft beer is so much better in a bottle, forget the cans mahfah. Not too bad overall beer tasting experience thank you columbus. Yes, an aye pee aye I can tolerate. Dude.\n",
      "As others have stated, it’s got a weird melon taste to it. It may be your thing but I’m personally not a fan.\n",
      "Nothing tops a cold Coors Light on a hot sunny Florida day. It’s like when someone’s cums on the roof of your mouth. Also, it’s a beautiful party drink, a cheap beverage, that is top tier for shotgunning and other party games. Very rare you will get ID if you are underage at a store.All in all, liquid gold. Like a marenellies that went to private school.\n",
      "Nothing like coming home after a long day and cracking on the oven for a nice easy preheat. Once you're cooking chuck that 6 pack of Rivéts inside with your nearest beer thermometer, when you've ticked over 27°C, you are ready for a delight.\n",
      "Normally not an IPA guy but this beer totally changed my opinion!! After I took a sip of this beer I knew it was 100% time to slay with my IPA. This is absolutely perfect if you like your beer like you like your women; blonde.\n",
      "Ok y'all hear me out.  Bud light is gross, Im not going to sit here and defend it. Its watery and overall just gets doesn't get you drunk quick enough. But bud light lime is on a whole new level. pull one of these frosty boys out the fridge and suddenly you feel like you're sipping a corona extra with the perfect beer to lime ratio. This stuff is legit. it is classy? no. Is it nice? no Is it 13.99 for a pack? Yes. is it the best beer you can get for this price? 100%\n",
      "I have no idea why people hate on the ole bud light, I get it, the forbidden syrup content is low, but it is a nice refreshing light beer. Great for parties to shot gun, beer pong and flip cup. This beer is a nice basic light beer, and people try to expect something that a light beer doesn’t have.\n",
      "Overall, Natty Ice is a decent beer; with having a higher alcohol content of beers it has a basic but good beer taste. Plus, the can is a sick blue and black, giving people a way to know you have big balls. It’s cheap as dirt but makes you squirt.\n",
      "The ultimate party beer is my description of this sacred brew. Cheap, easy to drink, and 5.9% alcohol per serving. Now that is a powerful drink that truly gets the blood flowing.\n",
      "Just a simple beautiful taste of freedom. This beer ain’t to expensive but gets the job done with a 5% content of the forbidden syrup.\n",
      "I first tried this years ago. The gold triple X sitting upon it's dark backdrop was daring and ominous. Years later after many disappointing tasting experiments I got XXX again. It has a strong, dark, rich flavor and a pleasant aftertaste.\n",
      "A good tasting beer that resembles one of a Coors Light. It has a light beer taste, and is quality when enjoyed cold. Also a great beverage for party games or just to enjoy with the boys on a boat.\n",
      "It does not get much better than a Michelin Ultra. The smooth tasting beer makes it perfect to get a party going, or to even have a SSS function. A Cold Michelob Ultra “hits different” than other beers. It has a unique skinny can, with the same 12 Fluid Ounce amount of beer tasting goodness as it’s opposing brews, while still having a one of a kind taste that can only be described as “Yeah that’s a Michelob alright, can I have another?”\n",
      "The Bud Light Lime has a quality lime taste and is one of my favorite beers. It has a taste resembling a Corona with its lime, and makes the other lime tasting beverages seem shitty, like the White Claw Natural Lime. For a man who enjoys his Beer, this will always be a go to for me.\n",

      "Going back monday, so you better Stock up on the pubs..🤣\n",
      "I have tried this beer on three different occasions and each time it immediately foams up to the point of aggravation. it is so annoying that i will not endure its fairly good flavor to suffer the indignities of this foaming menace when there are so may other beers that rise to the same flavor level and can actually be drunk within the first ten minutes of pouring it, and forget about trying to drink it straight from a bottle. That is mission impossible>\n",
      "Ap at brewery. Copper pour, sparse head. Malty aroma, raisins. Light sweet taste, more raisins. 3.6% mild light but full\n",
      "Not as good as a Spotted Cow but the price is great and a good farmhouse ale. Has a slight wheat taste.\n",
      "Bottle from vintage. Aroma is a little off IPA. Taste, well, what do you expect? Just another rude ass APA that wants to be IPA. There are so many IPA out there, they've taken the place of the cheap american pale lager for the ubiquitous cheap american beer. There must be a brahzillion of them out there. What else can be said?\n",

      "Got as a gift 6-pack. Sour, thin, over-carbonated. Has an “enjoy by” scale but nothing indicated. Committed sacrilege: after three sips I poured the rest out. Maybe I’ll use the others to cook brats.\n",
      "Great hot day refreshing lager,goes down smooth as.serve cold can't go wrong. Mmmm\n",
      "Very good brown ale. Big surprise to read the low alcohol amd calorie count. It is a very flavorful brown ale.\n",
      "Can from Total Wine in Sunnyvale, CA. Aroma is vanilla, artificial syrup, light malts. Taste is cream ale, vanilla, more artificial. Def not a stout...more of a cream ale which I strongly dislike.\n",
      "12oz bottle.  Pours a cloudy copper-gold with a tiny beige head.  Aroma is pine, resin, earth, orange, caramel, some grapefruit, and a little dough.  Taste is syrupy-sweet caramel, orange, pine, metal, grapefruit, earth, some minerals, some biscuit, and some yeast.  Moderate bitterness that grows over time.  Boozy - very boozy.  Full body.  Moderate carbonation.  Syrupy-sticky mouthfeel.\n",

      "Surprised I haven’t rated this. This was a 2016 bottle shared by pat. Brown color with medium to full head. Notes are plastic, dentist office, latex, and other infection. Foodery should be ashamed they sold this to my friend\n",
      "Cerveja levemente amarga, mas suave. Não beber muito gelada para poder perceber o verdadeiro sabor.\n",
      "Taurus, Taurus, Taurus that is my life now, I aspire to be the worlds greatest Taurus drinker, I love it. I am always drunk, because Taurus is this magical drink which has supernatural powers. you drink this, you will then become a top shagger . simples. if you thought jay from inbetweeners was the ultimate clunge magic, you're wrong with a pear Taurus in your hand the birds can't turn you down, in come fly with me Taaj had \"pussy waggon\", and in real life you can have the pussy waggon\" its just car full of Taurus.\n",

      " I love Taurus, you love Taurus, we all love Taurus\n",
      "I am a consistent Taurus drinker ! I have Taurus flowing through my veins, its in my blood stream at this point and I love it ! when I wake up in the morning with my morning wood, I'm thinking about Taurus. 50p a 440ml can which is 4% (however I prefer the 4.8% pear cider, that's the one which turns me on), if you need a good shag just bring 20 of your finest Taurus to the party and the bitches will be drooling. others whom rate the Taurus lowly are on the spectrum, its as simple as that. if you are in need of simple yet complex drink whilst shagging birds Taurus is for you !\n",

      "This just tastes funny. Sort of a watery, kinda minty, something-is-off flavor, kinda like sour milk. I don't know if it's because my palate is wrecked from just drinking a different beer (an inoffensive if not particularly good brown ale), or if I'm using the wrong glassware (teku glasses aren't the best for stouts), or what. Not the glassware, poured it into a dimpled mug and I'm getting the same thing. Maybe there's something wrong with this one, but from what I can tell, this is a bad beer.\n",
      "Was on offer in the local so tried it. This isn’t a good beer. No depth, it’s over sweet not tropical. So disappointed, it’s like an artificially flavoured cheap lager!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry but I bought 4 of these and be nothing else to drink!\n",
      "Bottle on clearance at bowsers, cheap. Cloudy pale, aroma of some kindah spice. Odd weird unique spice thang on teh uptake, but not real bitter. Yes, quite unique, almost like trying to like medicine. Whew. Difficult. A little too different I'd say. Whew. Perhaps just a tad of warming sensations from the ginger. Not sure about any lime tho. Would not repeat, repeat, would not repeat, heheheh.\n",
      "Thin bodied, almost no foam or head, zero lacing and only a hint of the characteristics of what is typically a rich and full-bodied style. Add to this the unfriendly service at their South Burlington, VT 'taproom' in the brewery, and I recommend you avoid this one.\n",
      "Keg at We Brought Beer, Balham.  Hazy straw with a white head.  Aroma of wet grass, some over-ripe fruit and that wet dog note.  Flavour is very sweet and caramelly, and I’m getting quite a note of skunked hops on this.  Not sure if that’s deliberately to make the beer sweeter.  However, it seems Wild might be missing the point of NEIPAs and their sweetness.  Flavour is again sweet, before there’s a rush of slightly metallic bitterness, followed by a lingering flavour, not unlike that which you might get after rapidly consuming a whole tube of fruit pastilles.\n",
      "Light yellow liquid. Scent of hay, herbs and yeast. Light mouthfeel with stale tones. Barrels, grass and resin acid.\n",
      "Genius. A delicious light beer that downplays the sickly maltiness and emphasizes citrus bitter hops. And it’s 3.0!  In the day of 8.0 beers that being on an instant headache, this beats out all the season beers. Only downside, hard to get drunk if that’s your thing\n",
      "* Bottle 5% Farmhouse Ale.\n",
      "* Appearance is hazy pale gold with an off-white dissipating head. \n",
      "* Aroma is earthy, bread, and spicy.\n",
      "* Palate is medium body, oily, high carbonation, with very fine bubbles. \n",
      "* Taste is dry, musty, bittersweet. \n",
      "* Finish is very dry and bitter.\n",
      "* Overall a musty, bitter, tangerine taste with a chalky mouthfeel, high carbonation 1.8/5.\n",
      "Nice light fruit flavored beer. Only 95 cal and minimal carbs. It uses artificial sweetener but has an authentic taate. Very nice refreshing warm weather beer.\n",

      "Some pretty harsh scores on this one, but I like it a lot. Especially in a glass straight out of the freezer, makes me feel like I'm actually at a bar. A decent replacement for actual draft.\n",
      "My go to beer. Better than any of the basic light beers, and cheaper too. Maybe not the best beer ever, but its 5 bucks a 6 pack.\n",
      "One of the best cheap beers and low in calories. Good for sporting events and whenever you want just a casual drink.\n",
      "Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt, coffee, dark chocolate, lighter coconut and just a hint of an offensive, tart, soapy note that intensifies upon swirling. Taste is dominated by that offensive tart and soapy note that drowns out all of the nicer coffee and chocolate notes in the background. Finishes on a sour note, with some soap lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.\n",

      "I absolutely loved Big Bad Baptist and Big Bad Baptista, so I was really looking forward to this beer, which I kinda saved for a special occasion, so it came as huge disappointment to me to find it infected and undrinkable, had to darinpour it. My release number is 12 and there apparently have been other reports of infection with this release number, so avoid it like the plague.\n",
      "Tasted great, i love the smell of it and taste and it went perfectly with my dinner.\n",
      "Brutal. Super sour apple cider vinegar most with some berry notes. Lightly sweet and very tasty. Some saltiness in the fade. Nit m jam. And not for a sour newbie.\n",
      "Well…yuck.  Those two words are never put in proximity when you rate Blatz.  Think about it.  When doling out the adjectives for that “Blessed Pleasure Elixir”, you are more likely to come across “magnificent”, “wonderful”, and “shaved pussy-like”.  Think about it.  Or not.\n",
      "Although this stuff does have alcohol, that’s about all I can say with positivity.  Don’t spend your life in sartorial conformity.  Get a Blatz.  Get it now.  Drink it down.

Honestly think it was a cold pint of coffee at three times the price. £4.80 on tap at head of steam in Nottingham. Been to this pub lots of times and beers are always good so I don't think it's their fault, just a poor beer.\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2015. Clear chestnut, with no head. Really quite flat, with very little carbonation. Not sure if the seal of the crown top wasn’t compromised. Aroma of Diasytal, nuts, and sweets. Toffee flavour, with bread and a copper note. Finish was Sugary water, earth, and metallic hints.\n",

      "I can't recommend it.\n",
      "On cask at Euston Tap. clear gold colour lasting white head good hoppy pale ale. light bitterness on the finish.  some grapefruit flavour.  light easy drinking entertaining. good apa.\n",
      "500ml bottle in 2015. I don’t know quite what it is about this beer, but I really don’t like it, and I never have. In bottle or cask. There’s a weird musty, but somehow sugary sweet aroma to it and the flavour really echoes that. I just get big candied peal mixed with cardboard.\n",
      "I bought that can version from HEB. I was excited to try it since I tried the Pacific Apricot Wheat. Not impressed. Very watery mouthfeel, very low apricot flavor, hardly any head retention, tasted weak.\n",
      "Not impressed. I guess I spoiled myself since I make my own beers but I try microbrews to get other flavors and ideas out there. This did not impress me at all, very watery mouthfeel, low head retention, smokey bitter taste, just not that good. Maybe a bottle conditioned double bock would be better, this is just not it.\n",

      "Bottle (2019 vintage). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately malty (chocolate cookie, caramel, roasted grain), with notes of soy sauce, plastic bags, pine sap, and alcohol. Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extremely disappointing. The aroma is just plain off...soy saucy and plastic-like. Where is the red wine character that I was hoping for (and persuaded to purchase because of)? Alas, it is not evident in this sample. Probably less of the fault of the base beer and just a failure of the barrel to yield its good qualities, instead imparting these icky off notes. Not enjoyable in the mouth either; wayyy too syrupy sweet with little else but harsh alcohol as an attempt to balance...I'd hesitate to even call it drinkable, but it's certainly not enjoyable. An unexpected drain pour...I really thought this was going to be mid/high 3s sort of beer.\n",
      "Lovely light taste best served ice cold. An excellent lager to drink in the summer\n",
      "I bought it at jumbo (0,5) for 3 euro. I think it is extremely overpriced for this product. Tastes like Red Bull with fruit taste. Nothing even close to the taste of cider. Very chemical color, smell and taste. In short - disgusting.\n",
      "Having one at Brideler Stuff in Bridel/Luxembourg.\n",
      "Light amber and light hazy with a frothy head. Malty smell. Rich malty taste with a slight bitter hop note. Low carbonation.\n",
      "Packaged on 18 September 19. The Aromas are hops, fruit, wet grain and solvents. Flavors are a little like nose, quite sweet up front along with some powerful solvents and a little bitter in The Finish. Rough drinking. One of the very few disappointments from Anchorage. Going to have a hard time finishing this.\n",
      "12 ounce bottle.  Pours light yellow with little foam.  The aroma is very neutral and the flavor is very light.  No mistakes here, but certainly not worth the premium price and not as good as a High Life which is setting the bar pretty low.\n",

      "Initial pour was milky light brown like a yoohoo, but as the rest of it came it was more like a traditional black stout.  Looked almost like chunks or hazies of hazelnut and chocolate floating, uncleared and unfermented.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).  \n",

Back-end has some strong aromatic Belgian esters with notes of banana chips, cloves, black pepper, musty coriander and pineapple that hang out on the palate along with some warming boozy ethyl volatiles that linger with the sweetness on the aftertaste.\n",

It’s so bad, you’ve just got to try it.  Smells like popcorn, weird savoury notes, soy sauce and burnt toast.  Medium body.  There’s fruitiness, but I could really place it as passionfruit... it’s horrible amount of wet rye bread, fennel, coriander and god knows what.  This is one of the worst beers I’ve ever had that has no fault.  It’s not badly made, it has no offtastes... it’s just bloody awful.  Everything you’ve heard is true.\n",
      "I’ve been drinking Batemans for the last 30 years. I don’t know what they’ve done to it in the last 6 months but the whole brewery is now undrinkable. Foul, nasty stuff. I don’t pour many bottles down the sink, but this one went. \n",

It was just too much and I noted after I purchased it, it is 10.5% alcohol.  I tried it on several occasions and I basically poured the last of my 4-pack down the drain.  Yes, it was that bad.\n",
      "My favorite hard cider!  I do think it could get by with a little less sugar but I love a good vanilla chai tea, don’t care much for hoppy drinks, and I would buy this chaider year-round if it were available.\n",
      "Big disappointment. If I had wanted anything as mercilessly bitter as that, I'd have bought an IPA or Pilsener. This completely lacks the sourness that defines Gose. Smells nice, tastes terrible.\n",
      "On bottle from Famila Lübeck, Germany. Pours dark brown into the glass with a small beige head. Taste is heaven with a nice balance of fruits, burned malt and brown sugar. A really nice German bock!\n",
      "Roze cider zonder schuim. De Cider smaakt mier zoet en iets naar rabarber. Daarnaast zat er iets romigs van de custard. Niet echt mijn ding dit, maar leuk om gehad te hebben.\n",
      "It is a very fresh and easy drinking pale ale especially in a warm climate. I was quite surprised. Location was Baa Baa black sheep near botanical gardens Singapore.\n",
      "Garrison has been around for a long time and beats the new trendy brands at there own game.\n",
      "Quite possibly the worst IPA I’ve had over the past 10yrs of nearly exclusively enjoying IPA’s.  This IPA was simply flat and sugary.  Highly NOT recommended as there are many top self IPA’s to enjoy here in Colorado.\n",
      "Bottle from my local grocery store in Queens, NYC. Light-colored medium, bubbly head that quickly fades. No lacing. Not at all hazy/cloudy as other reviewers mentioned. After the head fades, you could hand me a glass of this and tell me it's Mott's apple juice and I'd believe you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a hint of sourness. The combination of hops and slight sourness tastes a little skunky to me. Grapefruit stands out more than anything else. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've got to wonder if I may have gotten a bad/old batch. Not good at all.\n",
      "I had to pour this beer into the sink because it was so gross. Thought this was a red beer, but it looks and tastes like a dark one. My disappointment Is immeasurable,and my day is ruined. The only reason I give 1 points to everything is that I can't give zero.\n",
      "It’s cheap and overall if you’re looking for a basic cheap beer this isn’t a bad choice it’s mild and balanced it has an adjunct sweetness while having a mild hop character overall you can’t go wrong sure it’s not amazing but it’s at the very least competent\n",

      "Замечательный марцен.Вкус изящный,немного медовый.Очень люблю октоберфестовские сорта,этот из лучших.Avra greek restaurant Bangkok\n",
      "3grams carbs, 6.9% alcohol, gluten free?  The only downside is the price is about $12 per 6-pack here in Lexington KY.  Very delicious crisp cider that won't make you fat or give you diabetes plus it has a high alcohol content.  There is no aroma of \"rotting fruit\" as one reviewer describes.  If you are following the primal/paleo lifestyle (no gluten, low carbs) this is a godsend.\n",
      "Can as pictured. Hops and hemp, I heard the plants are related. Yellow with a thick white head. Does have a bit of a skunky nose. Taste is big thick viscous venerable hops, terribly IPA hops. Lots of impact here. You know it, whew. Too much, way too much. Who can enjoy so many hop preservatives in a beer? Just asking. Rude straight up and away, gahhhh. Nasty nellifier.\n",
      "First beer I drank on a regular basis. The most popular beers then were O'keefe, Export and 50. This was the best of the 3.\n",
      "This is me trying to beer I'm confident I'm not going to like. Purchased a 22oz bottle from my local Stater Brothers. Thick brown head on top of an opaque black body. It smells of peanut butter, with hints of milk and chocolate. This would be great if I like coffee, but I don't. Pretty much exactly what I'm not looking for in a beer. Honestly I feel like I wasted my six bucks.\n",
      "Pretty dry for my taste and much drier than other ones within the same terms of a stout. Literally woody taste and not smoothy as most of the people say! Very overrated, especially for a barrel aged stout!\n",
      "Mang-O-Rita has lots of fizzy bubbles and no foam nor lacing. The appearance is opaque orange. The aroma is of mangoes and pale malt, and the flavor is the same, with a Splenda brand sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Mang-O-Rita finishes (high-fructose corn syrup) drying. It's top-notch, for what it is, but I just don't like what it is. RJT\n",
      "This is the closest thing to a drain pour I've had In a loooong time.  12 oz. can purchased in San Antonio, TX. Pitch black pour with dark ruby highlights and a fizzy medium brown head and good retention. Spotty lacing. Aroma of dark booze. Flavors of black licorice and in-your-face booze. Any other would-be flavors are drowned out by alcohol. Ugh! This stuff would be better served for cleaning windshields!\n",
      "Champale Extra Dry has no foam nor lacing, but it does have lots of popping bubbles. The aroma is quite muted, but one can pick up faint pale malt and possibly citrus. The taste is of water, faint fruit, and pale malt. Mouthfeel is low to medium, and Champale Extra Dry finishes dry. RJT\n",
      "Encore une goutée au portugal mais il faut rendre à Cesar... CEte biere est à priori fabriquée en allemagne soit disant comme représentante de l'esprit craft beer et c'est encore une fois bien raté. Comme pour la red ale, elle arrache la gorge. Le houblon est présent mais aggressif et sans intérêt.\n",
      "J'aurai passé mes vacances à gouter tout ce qui se veut craft brassé par de grosses brasseries qui apparemment n'aiment pas la bière.\n",

      "Toujours cette mousse qui je suppose est isue d'une carbonatation forcée ? \n",
      "\n",
      "Aucun intérêt à nouveau.\n",
      "Bottle from the Co-op in Ancaster, near Grantham. Can't say I like this. It has a very unpleasant back of the mouth bitterness, which I assume comes from the oranges. Poured away.\n",
      "Dark brown with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Cocoa, some roast, overripe cherries, and strong booze.\n",
      "Can (thanks FatPhil). Straight from the can. This mofo is as acidic as battery acid. I can feel my teeth dissolving. Dry acidic mouthfeel. Nope.\n",
      "This is by far the blandest beer I have ever had.  I see the word sour on the label so I'm thinking that this might be a gose or a Berliner Weiss style of beer.  This was nothing what I was expecting.  I've been to the brewery and I love Sam Adams, however this is the first time I have ever been disappointed by them.  If you are a true fan of sour beer, do yourself a favor and not even bother with this one.\n",
      "Bottle from vintage, $3. Yes, pour is nice dark brown and it does smell like malt & filberts. The taste shockingly announces its 10%! Whew. Wassermann warming sensations as it hits the gullet. Forget that, I may get sued by a snowflake. This stuff is sending me to may safe zone, way back there. Strong big ass drink, lots of vyzhah. Middle is menacing choco malted filbert megah. Two of these and yi'll be on the floor. Heavy medicinal boozy finish. Yes, strong armed american ale from start to finish. Flavors hide the cloying alky laced clown hiding back there down in the ghetto, behind the barrels.\n",

      "Tastes like mildly alcoholic, kettle soured Gatorade. This is an excellent example of \"who thought this was a good idea\".\n",
      "Worst iteration of a Belgian White I have ever tasted.  Only grabbed it because the store was closing.  Slight citrus taste, no detectable coriander.  Tastes like a Budweiser poured over an orange peel.  Will not make this mistake again.\n",
      "Very enjoyable. One of the best of the flavored beers I would say. Lime flavor wasn’t overdone. Just right and very refreshing. Good job LaBatt. Cheers.\n",
      "Perhaps one of the most unpleasant flavor combinations I've come across. Complex, sure, but the clash between acidic coffee, uber-tart citrus-berry, vanilla, bourbon, and oak leaves me reeling. Couldn't finish a 4 oz. taster. Not my thing.\n",
      "Odd orangy pink pour. Smells like bathroom spray. Strange flavor of fruit juice and Certs. The slight mint taste is truly bizarre. This beer is really weird. Can.\n",
      "Bottle pours into glass with an unexpected over the top foaming activity. Settles to a beauty of sizzling action within iced tea eye. First taste is foam, to stop a spill. Volatile, alky laced blast in the facial senses. Rich thick medicinal feel to this alky bomb. Warming sensations? Fer sher, back of mouth and down the throat. Seems like it could be used as a disinfecting surface cleaner. Rude, hope this ages well. Expecting sherry, yah know? Well, this aint there yet.  Straight up kick you in the face, be prepared to sip for a while. Suddenly, half way thru the bottle, I begin to get dizzy, I think.\n",
      "Pale yellow color, sour lager aroma. Not detecting anything Oktoberfesty about this, just a common sour lager.\n",
      "Nice color and smell but once u finish it you feel nothing in your mouth. Not even cheap so I won’t buy it again.\n",
      "Keg at BrewDog Outpost Tower Hill.  Near black with a beige head.  Aroma is very sweet, with abounding vanilla, tonka, caramel, cheap chocolate and earthy notes.  Considering the use of oats, this is quite thin.  Way too sweet for me.  There’s earthy bitterness, but it doesn’t really balance the sweetness.\n",
      "355ml can (Sip, Tallinn) (4:2:3:1:6=1.6)\n",
      "Blander than the apricot synchopathic we just had, but just as acidic. Some blueberry here, but it's terrible. Lilac-coloured battery acid. Noppers.\n",
      "Having one at La Rusticana in Howald.\n",
      "Clear golden with a frothy head.\n",
      "Grainy, malty smell. Malty taste with an agreeable bitterness and a hint of acidity.\n",
      "A refreshing beer.\n",
      "355ml can (Sip, Tallinn) (4:3:3:2-:7=1.9-)\n",
      "Disgustingly sour fruity aroma, apricot clear. Harsh acidic palaate. Apricot and battery acid taste. Nope.\n",
      "355ml can (Sip, Tallinn) (3:2:3:1:5=1.4)\n",
      "Lemon juice aroma. Lemon juice palate. Harsh floral perfumey lemon juice taste. A sour harsh mess, almost undrinkable.\n",
      "Wow!  I’ve never had such a sour beer!  I tried the Ghost Cow Oktoberfest as part of a six pack mix and match at a local beer store and immediately threw it out.       Completely undrinkable.\n",
      "I rated this a 5/5, or 20/20, because it’s absolutely one of the best hazy IPAs on the market. My first taste was at a beer festival in ATL over a year ago. The taste, a hoppy, slightly bitter, tropical, citrus IPA, just leaped above all the other brews at the Beer Fest. This IPA was not in distribution at the time, but they are now, so if you like IPAs, order it, buy it, taste it, you’ll love this one!\n",

      "On tap at Shacklands, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma is quite estery, with candied sugar, phenols, and Belgian yeast. Flavour is just disgusting, with phenols and who knows what other off-notes. This is rancid.\n",
      "Can from Secret Summer Santa 2019 Beerhunter111, cheers! Starts off as a nicely fruity sour and finishes as a lingering box of matches. Didn't finish it. Not sure what happened here.\n",
      "Ettersom jeg ikke skal på What's Brewing er en planke på B&B et enkelt alternativ: uklar, nærmest grumsete korngul med fint skum som varer. Heftige saker dette her med (litt for) mye humle, helhetsinntrykket blir så beskt at det kjennes ut som om plombene skal løsne. Completely unbalanced and distinctly uncharming. Repulsive aroma as well, but it turned out that this was dregs from the bottom of the keg. Must re-rate.\n",
      "Can (thanks FatPhil). Straight from the can. This is just pure battery acid. No thanks.\n",
      "Not my kind of Pale Ale. The flavors just are not to my liking. Too bad, but 7.2% alcohol is nice.\n",
      "Another quality Ice beer. Molson Ice seems just the slightest bit more complex than some of the other Ice brews. Very enjoyable. Cheers.\n",
      "One of the best beers I have ever tried. Serve with an orange. Best from on tap, but decent from the bottle.\n",
      "my absolute failsafe beverage, whether its pre drinks or a full session, everybody should measure liquids in 'bottles of lambrini'. It gives you the best drunk and its even easy to drink the next day, permitting you dont have much of a hangover\n",
      "This is utter piss, what the actual hell were they thinking putting cheap strawberry flavour in a supposed hop forward beer? This is an utter abomination, it is awful. How can I not swear? Utter utter utter isht. Do the anagram, don't drink this. Rate beer, my rating is zero, but you won't accept this\n",
      "Typical golden ale. Urine flavour reigns prominent after the immediate taste. There are some tropical notes, but the body is much too thin to sustain them.\n",
      "Very bitter and tangy. Far too many hops. Difficult to enjoy as it's so harsh on the taste buds. Very fruity grapefruit taste and too citric for my taste\n",
      "On tap at Saulter Street, pours a fairly clear dull orangey blonde with a small white head. Aroma is full of diacetyl, with bready malt and subdued hops - yuck. Flavour is just rancid, being totally ruined by diacetyl, followed by harshly bitter hops. Gross bitter butter bomb.\n",
      "Typisk tysk. Korn og en masse sødme. Let humlet med europæiske typer. En klassisker.\n",

      "This was my first IPA in a while and while i’d say it’s definitely drinkable with a very “sparky” palate note and a fruity nose that has strong hints of pineapple I’m not a fan. It’s VERY bitter. Maybe I need to drink more IPA’s and i’m going to start trying 1 each time I drink to develop an understanding of them but I would MUCH rather prefer my Outmeal Stout or a Blonde beer\n",

      "[12oz bottle from Total Wines, Brea, CA.] A bright orange amber pour with a thick cream coloured head; an oddly familiar, but unidentifiable, spicy aroma - perhaps a fabric softener or room freshener; thin and watery with a similar spicy taste, and some vanilla and caramel. One sip was enough - an immediate drain pour for me.\n",

      "can in Manchester VT --- 2/26/19 --- Aroma of malt and light hops.  Hazy amber brown color, ivory head that drops to a thick rim, wide bands of lace.  Taste is malt with an odd hops addition on a lightly carbonated swallow.  Medium finish which actually can't get over soon enough.  I think this is past its prime.  Too bad, but if I pay for it, I rate it.\n",
      "Smells like malt. Tastes like malt. Probably malt then. Why bother with any other ingredients if you can get away with this and for some reason beyond understanding people are buying it? Where are all those hops mentioned in the description; cancelled each other out maybe?\n",
      "Great crisp taste. Has the sweetness just like they describe but just enough hops to keep it from being overly sweet. Perfect fall beer- best enjoyed outside :)\n",
      "16 ounce can at the house. Smells grainy. Real light yellow with thin white head. Light bodied and taste the grain. Smooth and easy to drink. Little of grain aftertaste. Just a lawnmower beer and something to drink. Cheers!\n",

How this was ever passed off as a beer is beyond me as it really isn't appealing at all. Some might like it if they like the heavily spiced Belgian offerings but it's not for me. I had to pour half down the sink as I just couldn't get on with it.\n",

Pour clear, deeply rich golden, white head fizzes itself out rather quickly, plenty of remaining carbonation.  Taste boozy, fusels, corn, buttery, stale vegetal, stale lime, and some queasy salsa associations.  Medium sweet that accumulates, low to no bitterness, just a hint of tang from the citrus.  Medium body buttery, somewhat crisp, corn again a problem here, a little gassy-phenolic but not much.  Maybe if I throw in a few ice cubes?  Don't release this garbage.  [2019.10.11: 1.4]\n",

      "Just another of a grand-zillion other IPA out yonder, but it at least has some cutting co2 on the palate that almost makes me forget its an IPA. Its bitter and yer hop-ness is quite fresh tho still very bitter. A little difficult in the end. Some hints of poorly made homemade cider.\n",

      "Sampled at Great American Beer Festival 2019 in Denver, Colorado. Light, dry, hoppy, really don't like this style.\n",
      "Yuk. Not a fan of this flavour at all. I would have enjoyed a Bud more. This isn't the delicious IPA I'm looking for...\n",

      "The aroma is catty dank resiny hops and some fruit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, not my favorite IPA, a bit of a disappointment.\n",
      "I've never reviewed or returned any alcohol before, but I most definitely will be returning this. I'll skip the fancy words. It almost has a bubblegum taste to it, it's so artificial and terrible tasting. I do not recommend at all.\n",
      "My favourite pint! Like drinking milk! Absolutely gorgeous, easy to drink malty pint. Nice aroma, no long lasting after taste. Really more-ish. 10/10 would recommend.\n",
      "Oops, picked up this can of IPA by accident, thought it was a milk stout, oh well. Well, it is pretty hazy but not muddy as name would indicate. Smell is muted IPA perfume. Rude crude uninteresting bitterness like any other IPA. As a matter of fact, this is more bitter than many double IPA I've had. Yes, just another one of a billion IPA out there, not much difference. I guess the politically correct term for craft beer nowadays is IPA. What ever  -  WTF?  Not impressed, the hops cover any imperfections the beer may actually have. Tastes is almost identical the the double IPA I just had, or is this the problem with IPA; after you drink a good one, your taste buds are ruined for an hour or so? Let me simply ask: Do you like chewing on a fresh rubber inner tube mixed with green grapefruit rinds and old weathered pine tar sap, chased with turpentine? Just asking. One rude straight up ass beer style.\n",
      "So here we are, the strange chief of police. Well, I guess its a close resemblance to Harbour. At almost 10% no wonder why you feel like you used to live out a carefree existence - yet haunted by a troubled past. Pours out a bit thick and hazy. Smell in non-offensive but the taste really kicks your ass. The amount of hop bitterness makes it a one sided flavor that would cover any possible beer imperfections. Whew. There you have it; terribly on style, go figger. Its just another one of a quadra-million purposefully high-hopped beers out there. At least it was in a bottle.\n",

First taste is just the most plainly rude straight up ass IPA I've had in a fortnight, it must be imperial. I swear it almost gives me a gag reflex, but not. Come now, how is this not in the IPA style? Too big boozy & bosomed for an APA. Just asking. Pretty soon they are gonna have to make a new style APA wannahbee IPA. Yes, terribly on style with the best of the IPA and many imperial IPA, or should I say double IPA, or should I say double imperial india pale ale? JMHO, there you have it. Yes, this is not an APA, please change the style admin, hehehehhh.\n",

It lingers in your moth for such a long time. This gottah be way more than 30 IBU, no shit and its difficult too! Grinding gooch, gook, gringo, guido, grahzilla.

      "can at home which came with the skyline boxset. the beer had a haze and was hoppy and fruty. but for me this was good beer just didnt really like it\n",
      "Citrus, sweet, Landry seahorse, a restaurant next to my apartment. It’s pricy to have a dinner here.\n",
      "This is the best light beer you can get on the market.  Better than bud light or the new flavored natural light\n",
      "So its a can of the ultimate balance of the finest beer ingredients made out of the best water from the elusive spring of life? Looks like any other generic first generation clear pale IPA. Tastes like any other crisp fresh IPA. Rude as all hell as with any well made ubiquitous IPA. Terribly rubbery chewing on rubber inner-tube mixed with sightly fermenting green grapefruit pulp all coated with spruce tree sap. Good thing it smells better than it tastes. Yes, just another on-style one of a quadre-quintillion other IPA's out there.\n",
      "One of the most overrated drinks I've ever been recommended. It's extremely bitter and sour.\n",
      "This tasted like an IPA not a lager. Do not buy if you are looking for a balance of hops and malts. This has a bitter aftertaste and takes like citrus and pine. It's not bad for ....an IPA. I really wish brewers would label products appropriately. Maybe it was technically brewed using lager yeast but this is not the taste commonly associated with lager so it should have a disclaimer.\n",
      "I drank this beer when I was 18, years later, I got headaches from Budweiser, and I went back to Miller, no problems, in fact I buy it for my kegerator now!!\n",
      "A green can. Big bitter taste. Big foaming head on yellow clear beer. Typical IPA. Yes, so many of these and they practically all taste the same. May be one of the last IPA I try: No lie. Just can't get used to the terrible on style nature of these super bitter beers. How can anybody think real IPA is smooth light malts and easy to drink, come now.....\n",
      "330ml can: BB 6th Aug 2020, brewed in Belgium (at De Proef for beer 52). Drank at home on 2nd Oct 2019. Very pale urine yellow with a swiftly fading white head. Watery, bland, slightly bitter/bretty and boring. My first and hopefully last beer from the Mothership.\n",
      "Wheaty, very foamy but a horrid mustard aroma that hits you after, probably the cloves. Not for me...\n",
      "Another can of ubiquitous IPA? From cally none the less. Smells like, tastes like. Yes, stronger than most APA, definitely in the IPA strata. I think I even get a slight detectable warming sensation. Surprising. Taste is much stronger alky than 6%.  Yes, one big kick ass beer. However, I do sense a little welcomed cutting co2 in the finish. Smooths it out, just a little, heheheh. Definately more than a go 2 brew.\n",
      "Feinporige, langanhaltende, große Schaumkrone eines dunkelbraunen, fast schwarzen Dunkelbiers mit Rotschimmer. Süßlich-malzig im Geruch. Vollmundiger Antrunk mit Bitterschokoladennoten, Körper mit röstmalzigem, minimal herben Noten. Langer, süß-malziger aber etwas wässriger Nachhall, der leicht an ein Stout erinnert. Schnell wieder vergessen.\n",
      "Dichte, feinporige, lang anhaltende, schöne Schaumkrone eines klaren, dungelgelben Märzens. Leichter Malzgeruch, der sich im Geschmack spiegelt. Malziger Antrunk, kräftigerer, etwas stärker karbonisierter Körper. Minimal herber Abgang, der etwas muffig nachhallt. Etwas besser als das Durchschnittsmärzen, aber nicht süffig.\n",

      "Lone Star Light is what it is. It's a decent cheap beer. It's not a coffee/chocolate stout, a pomegranate/coconut flavored sparkling muscato, or even a double hopped IPA. If you want those things go buy them. Lone Star Light is an ice cold cheap light beer. If you like cold cheap beer after a long day at work, you might want to try Lone Star.\n",
      "It pours golden color and unleashes a rich malty-sweet aroma backed up by a fresh perfume of spicy/herbal hops. The mouthfeel is full, the flavor deep and opulent dominated by Munich malt, some caramel sweetness and a firm blast of hops.\n",
      "I love strong IPAs, single, double, or triple, as well as potent porters and burly stouts.  Whatever this beer is, it is not an IPA.  It tastes more like rancid barleywine.  Utterly wretched, and one of the worst beers I've ever tasted.\n",
      "12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 9/23/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. Overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Nice clean pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best macro light lagers I've had as expected of Pabst.\n",

All around great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, and great noble hop presence/balance for the style. Mild on adjuncts. A really enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best AAL I have had for sure.\n",
      "Not a pleasant beer. Mostly chili vegetable matter. Slight spice. Pours golden clear with good head. Light spicy finish. Tap at brewery.\n",
      "Can. Nose is cola, sweet malt, coconut, raspberry is softer than I imagined. Taste is coconut, caramel, pronounced raspberry and raspberry ice cream, sour, dark chocolate hint of soy and liquorice, blueberries, glacier cherry. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a genuinely awful mess of a drink. I don't know what went wrong but it's a cacophony of flavours that are close to undrinkable.\n",
      "Can as pictured. Mild pine nose? Maybe.  Pours like a somewhat viscous pale ale. Thinner craggy head.  First taste is stronger APA effects, bordering into the IPA territory. They're attacking from behind by circling around the front! Bitter lingering longingly lasting thicker viscous mouth coating chewing on green grapefruit rinds IPA nastiness. Turpentine I say! No, just kidding, almost tastes like turpentine. Yes, a totally on style IPA; go figger. There, another ubiquitous mega-available IPA. IPA lovers, put this in yer bucket list. hehehehh\n",
      "Lovely darkish Autumn Bitter. Smooth texture, not too hoppy or heavy. A nice pint this one\n",
      "Nice beer, refreshing. Great straight out of bottle as great from the glass. Really tasty if it's chilled properly. Quality vs price combo.\n",
      "I am always interested in Octoberfest beers, so I tried this one when I saw it in a local store that I trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really bad.  Not even a good aroma.  It has that \"rusty water\" taste associated with bad hops and/or OVERLOADED hops.  Hops?? In an Octoberfest??? A beer  KNOWN for its MALT??!!!  The label says \"golden lager\", but it tastes like a really bad czech pilsner.   The back label lists \"Bayerisches bier\".   This beer tastes like that Mex mess known as \"Modelo\".  I was surprised that this beer had such an ugly taste.  Ive had some bad Octoberfests, but this one pretty much takes 1st Place.  Congrats, I will never buy this swill again.\n",
      "I have been trying to taste an Ayinger beer for a while.  When I saw this Octoberfest, I thought \"great!!!, time for a taste!!!!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Um.......no.  Horrible.  It had a good aroma, but then, the bitterness of the hops makes this MALT associated beer taste like what my dog left behind.  REALLY bad.  I was surprised.  I had heard so much about how \"great\" Ayinger beer is.  No.  Not this one.  Not a good example of an Octoberfest (known for its MALT, not its hops) beer.  I have 3 or 4 Octoberfest beers that are truly  GREAT  Octoberfests,  this isnt one of them.  A very poor attempt at this beer.  Try to stop adding hops at approx.  150 lbs. per bottle there dear Ayinger.\n",

      "OK, another can of fricken sculpin for a tick, how many are there? Then on top of that there are a gazillion IPA out there? Doesn't anybody ever get tired of IPA and all the bastardized styles that are really IPA? Just asking. Clear pale in the glass with a big foamy head. I'm not sure why its called aloha because its just another fricken bitter IPA. So much bitterness, you'd never pick out what the aloha flavor was. Yes, nasty nellie negative norton, straight up ass nut sack. There you have it, just another ubiquitous IPA that wants to be an imperial IPA; tastes just like one. Finishes with a warming sensation going down the throat. Not pleasant, at least it doesn't smell like diesel body odor.\n",

I have tried several different sake varieties, in Japan and in the United States, although I would not consider myself an expert by any means. The bottle was nice, the price was decent, and I was excited to try a \"plum\" flavor sake. Unfortunately, this sake is really bad. Do yourself a favor and don't try it. It's major notes on the palate are of cherry flavored cough syrup, so don't buy it unless you enjoy that kind of thing because that is basically what it tastes like.

Not even the usual amount of filler malt that I always complain about. Doubtful that this brew has had any sort of hop waved in its direction either. Waste of money, time, taste buds. It's like drinking ghosts. Not even a beer for teenage trainee drinkers.\n",

Yes, its still all over the table and as I drink to the middle of the can I don't give a shit. Better go git a paper towel so I can redd this mess up, with a buggy and warsh cloth.

      "Bottle from spar. Decent beer, nice flavours, bitter sweet. I enjoyed drinking this\n",
      "Bought from spar piccadilly, picked it up because of the design, was surprised when read on back its made by robbies. I really enjoyed it, decent flavour, juicy fruity.\n",
      "Excellent wheat beer. Clean, sharp acidity characteristic of the type, and none of the burnt taste that mediocre ones have.\n",

      "A dirty, oniony, sour, muddy IPA, sadly.\n",
      "Keg at the Redchurch Brewery, Bethnal Green In 2015. Murky golden with a vanishing white head. Aroma is super tart, with vinegar, blue cheese and stewed fruit notes. Flavour is surprisingly watery, with a bit of soft fruit.\n",
      "I was walking the pier, having a not so good day,when I stumbled across 13 guns. my mood was lifted instantly,until I opened the can that is. The smell instantly burned my nostrils causing my sinuses to flare up. I was shocked. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt so I dived in head first to what was the worst experience of my life. I've been through a divorce that was smoother then this beverage. The taste of ass has been lingering in my mouth for 3 days now. Overall,wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Like a bunch of flowers with a lemon touch, wonderful! Bitter sweet like a love relation with someone from an enimy family\n",
      "Dark with a frothy head.\n",
      "Very malty smell. Tastes like a less sweet Malzbier. I like Malzbier. Medium carbonation.\n",
      "Can sample at a tasting at Tom L's place. Thanks Odi. Clear golden, white head. Stale hops, oxidation, cardboard, honey, sweet, bitter finish, a bit of alcohol.\n",
      "16oz can.  Pours an opaque pale yellow with a small white head.  Aroma is orange, pineapple, dough, grass, and a little pine.  Taste is orange, pineapple, oats, vanilla, pine, peach, dough, and a little grapefruit.  Skunky finish.  Pine lingers.  Light-medium body.  Moderate carbonation.  Oily-chewy mouthfeel.\n",
      "Pine and resin, some citrus, barely any malt. This beer is reminiscent of others in it's category; that is low abv IPA's, the overall body of the beer is lacking in malt flavor and bitterness while the taste of hops overpowers anything else worthy of attention. Not the worst beer I've had but definitely not good by any standards.\n",
      "From a Kroger can this pours a little darker than average pale and it seems to be quite thick. Big fruity rude aroma with a mild cleaning pine fluid nose. Taste is big bad-ass and bitter. BBAB! I second that with an upper gullet warming sensation. Its near the big ten; and you feel it. In the end, is it possible I detect some sensations of unthinkingly dizzy. Whew. What else can be said? One bitter straight up ass, terribly on style, IPA IPA  brew. There you have it, another ubiquitously available style, duh.\n",
      "Jasne złote klarowne, niska ale fetą i trwała piana. Aromat chmielewy, cytrusowy fajnie pachnie. Średnia goryczka, pijalne. Średnie niskie wysycenie, porządne piwo\n",
      "First tried this while on vacation on tap at a bar.  I fell in love!  I don't think I will ever drink another brand!\n",
      "Lovely look, aroma and great tasting beer. \n",

      "This quad tasted more like a sour.  I couldn’t drink it!  It was the worst quad I’ve ever had. Just wasted $20.\n",
      "Canned, from Systembolaget.  Dark brown, small head. Aroma of well, oatmeal raisin cookie. Sweet with medium body and clean, sterile mouthfeel. Tastes like... Oatmeal raisin cookie. Low bitterness in a finish with some tin foil. Oh, the refinement. I've always dreamed of liquid raisin cookie in tin foil. And the complexity!\n",
      "Tall can from grocery store. Smells fruity and well hopped, pours golden with ample head. A bit murky, but that could be stylistically appropriate. Thin and dry, with too little malt/sweetness to counter the hops. Found it too unpleasant to drink.\n",
      "440ml can, but 4 days out of date.  Murky dark brown. Aroma of dark malt and metallic notes.  Dark sugars in the flavour with damp malt.  Considering it had only just gone out of date, this beer was in a bad way.\n",
      "From a can you get a surprisingly clear liquid (considering the name, heheh) with a big foamy pour. It has just a very slight haze but no way is this hazy. No real offensive IPA smells in this one. Taste is big bad IPA of course and possibly it has a bit of an aged feeling to it. Date code is CMB1 9198 2361, whatever that means. Yes, big bitter IPA bullshit, like any other of the thousand ubiquitous IPA out there. What else can be said? NOTHING. Oh well, so goes the tick. Not impressed.\n",
      "Valójában egy ízesített nyáron jól Iható sör , azonban kicsit túl tolták benne az aromát és talán a savakat. Lehűtve viszont üdítőnek kiváló.\n",
      "I frikkettoni (hipster et similia) oggi bevono acqua e sapone (v. IPA). Andatevene affanculo.\n",
      "Yellow pour with zero head. Aroma is odd and medicinal. Has a weird flavor of unknown spices. Kind of tastes like a Band Aid smells. Strange numbness on the palate. Little to enjoy here. Bottle.\n",
      "16oz can.  Pours a hazy pale gold with a tiny white head.  Aroma is pineapple, mango, dough, some orange, and light pine.  Taste is dough, papaya, candied mango, yeast, pepper, some orange, and pine.  Some grapefruit in the finish.  Dry finish.  As it warms, the citrus moves more to the front.  Light-medium body.  Medium carbonation.  Oily, thin mouthfeel.\n",
      "Tastes like cucumbers and bleach.  I like a huge range of beer styles, including (good) English bitters,  but how anybody can drink something like this is beyond me.\n",
      "\"Heberbräu Krawandorfer\", 5 %, Flasche (MHD: 5.12.19) von Heldrichs Getränkeeck, Edelsfeld. - Hell goldbraun, schwach trüb. - In der Nase leicht karamelliges, bonbonsüßes helles Malz, grüne Äpfel, chemische Zitronigkeit, Hefe. - Antrunk übersüß hellmalzig mit greller Fruchtigkeit (grüne Äpfel, Zitronenschorle). Knallig süßsäuerliche Bonbonaromen, Anklänge an Putzlumpen. Im Hintergrund etwas rauhe, wenig aromatische krautige Hopfenherbe. Stark rezent. Im Abgang immer noch süßsauer mit leerer Bittere. Ranziger Nachtrunk. - Mißratenes Landbier mit greller, scharfer Zitrone, zu süß und derb bitter. Ungenießbar. (21.9.2019.)\n",
      "Falls City Classic Pilsner has a medium, creamy, off-white head, an odd, murky, gray-gold appearance, and some glass lacing. The aroma is strange- Belgian spicy yeast. The flavor is likewise strange, but bitterness is in play. Mouthfeel is medium, and Classic Pilsner finishes on the dry side. RJT\n",

      "Ha, Ha, right out of the can I thought I was getting a hazy session IPA but hey, its a slight haze but not session.  Well, maybe its a session of yer a serious IPA lover, wink, wink.Big thick craggy head. Penetration flavors that could never be refreshing. Who wants a preservative in their beer? See here!  WTF with these IPA beers, they all taste the same and they all have different names; hah, and there must be a gahzillion of them. Happy bussyshit. Slight warming sensation thru the gullet. Difficult. What eles can be said? Terribly on style, why sher: right up thar wittah best IPA's 'round. Go get it IPA beer nut, I mean coconut.\n",
      "The 3rd and last in the Ginger trilogy, first off they've got the name wrong. It should of course be called Sabre Tooth Tiger Tom after Britain's greatest ever war hero, a veteran of too many campaigns to count, leader of the Minxy Little Tricksters and inventor of smoking \"the army way\" What a shame then that this beer has less body than a string vest, it's described as a mild, which again is the last thing you'd call S.T double T. It's a metallic tasting thin drink that reminds me of home brew, urgh. Get that n☆p!\n",
      "Clear copper body and little foam, sweet fake chestnut syrup on the nose. Flavour is just a pile of cloying chestnut syrup blended into overcarbonated soda water. The fakest of fake beers.\n",
      "Excellent pint of fortyniner at the hoggett, Hook, Hants. Wonderful deep colour and balanced maltiness and bitterness. Rescued my tastebuds after a terrible pint of Marstons 61 deep!\n",
      "A terrible, excessively hoppy american style ale. It is rare that I have to pour an ale away if it's not actually off, but it did with this awful stuff. Marstons - you know better than this! Stop it! At least label it as what it is so people like me can avoid it!\n",

      "What the hell? This beer is getting a 97 overall on ratebeer? Dang, I must really be out of it. Of course, its a given that I'm not crazy about pumpkin beers to begin with, but I can still usually drink them. This one, though, was a drainpour. Something about the taste of a baked pumpkin with a very pronounced bitterness over a semi-dry malt just doesn't work - at all. My wife even said it smelled horrible as I poured it out and she complained she'd have to clean the sink. I didn't really spend too much time analyzing this, so I don't have a ton more depth to provide. Two sips was enough to convince me to dump it. But it had a good enough mouthfeel if you ignore the flavor, and it looked fine, so I can't ding it on those two dimensions.\n",
      "Głęboko złota barwa, bardzo fajna piana, raczej klarowne. Aromat chmielu z ale raczej ziolowy i trawiasty niż cytrusowo żywiczny. Średnia goryczka, jakiś tam posmak skórki cytrusow, trawa cytrusowa, chmiel. Pijalny Ale ale bez szału.\n",

      "The darkest one of the variety. Lots of malt. Reminds me how much better American beer is than European. They beat us on tradition but their beer has been outdone by American microbrews.\n",
      "Here we have another universal credit budget drink... Again as the last woodgate review this alcoholic beverage is a cut about the usual. Apple cider... This one is made from tinned pears and possibly brown sugar the kind of drink you would find in the hands of some embarrassing uncle with a Georges shirt on trying to fit in with the lads an abomination of a drink that will open the flood gates if your feeling blocked up....\n",

      "I Absolutely LOVE THIS Bier! They USED to carry this brew at the Walburg Mercantile German Restaurant & Biergarten in Walburg, Texas. Frankly I am Really pissed that they stopped carrying this Awesome Nectar! I have only been there 2 or 3 times in the last 15 or so years for this one simple fact...\n",
      "New to craft beer and saw this was a must get in the stout category. Unfortunately I was not a fan of the bourbon aspect  and couldn't get past the heavy alcohol taste. Maybe after trying more stouts I'll gain an appreciation, but for now I wouldn't say this a great beer.\n",

      "903 Brewers The Chosen One 6.8 % ABV 35 IBU. This cream ale pours a clear golden yellow color with a finger length slightly off white colored head that hangs around for a bit before dissipating leaving some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of coconut with a massive grain backbone with a hint of lemony citrus aroma. The flavor is sweet with the grain flavor coming through before giving way to a delicious almost toasted coconut coconut flavor before finishing with a slight hoppy bitterness to offset the sweetness of the grains and coconut  it also finishes with more coconut. The mouthfeel is creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation definitely not to thin or thick spot on with the mouthfeel. 8/10\n",
      "Great Taste. If your saying it has no head, IT'S A CIDER, IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO HAVE HEAD LMFAO. Have had both on Tap and in a Bottle., both are great but Tap is always better. I definitely get the Pineapple and also get a strong White Gummy Bear after taste. This is very smooth with little to no bite at the end of the drink. This is tied for the best Cider I have ever had. It is VERY SWEET, something I like but not everyone does. Ciders over Beer here!\n",

      "22 oz. bottle, pours a motor oil black with a small tan head. Aroma smells sour, with roasted malt, bourbon and sour notes. Flavour is vinegary and sour - ugh, this is infected. Not much bourbon or any pastry goodness. Surprising a Cycle BA stout would be sour-infected. Poor.\n",
      "I love the design of of the can and each description. The flavour profile described on the can is accurate as always with sweetwater. It's one of my favorites from sweetwater.\n",
      "Schnell zerfallende, großporige Schaumkrone. Leichter Malzgeruch eines leicht trüben, gelben Pilseners. Spritzig-herber Antrunk. Leicht malziger, wässriger Körper, der schnell von einer stark metallischen Herbe abgelöst wird, die den Körper und Abgang total dominiert und in einem modrigen langen Nachhall endet. Nicht langweilig, sondern schlecht, lieber nie wieder.\n",
      "Very nice beer! This is the kind of beer that is a good beer to drink, when you want to drink a good beer. I reccomend drinking this beer, highly!🍺\n",
      "SO, you just can't get away from these IPA. You go to find new untasted beers and what's the majority? You got it. So I'm expecting some alky soaked  random ubiquitous viscous bitter brew from start to finish. And it looks like t is. It also has a big fat head. Clear pale. Terribly on style IPA, what else can be said? Why would anybody ever put this many hops in a beer? To preserve it? Who wants preservatives in beer, we can trust our canning abilities in this day and age.\n",
      "Sept 2019  330ml dark bottle, unfiltered, from Beer52. Poorly designed and printed label - like an amateurish attempt at a Grateful Dead album cover. I struggled to make out the name. Beer is a sludgy amber. Quite hoppy with baby vomit aroma. Strong, very sweet malt. This is rather crude and simplistic. Rather like an over-enthusiastic and clumsy first time home brew. Not good.\n",
      "One of a trio from this brewery gifted by Red of Basildon. Quite simply this is one of the foulest, bad-tasting, nastiest drinks I've ever had. I really cannot overstate how unpleasant this is, it is thinner than a supermodel on the 14th day of a fortnight's fasting and the only ginger thing worse than this sang with the Spice Girls. Please, please avoid. The Queen is dead boys.\n",
      "Beautiful strong ale. Vanilla niceness, mellow and cheerful, enjoyed consuming this\n",
      "Das Bier kenne ich von diversen Reisen nach München, wo es natürlich im besten im Augustiner Bräu beim Hauptbahnhof mundet. Es ist ein wunderbar ausgewogenes Bier, bei dem einfach alles passt. NIcht zu einfach, nicht zu abstrus. Solide und doch wunderbar erfrischend. Das kann man immer wieder trinken. Auch wenn in manchen Bobo-Restaurants außerhalb Bayerns ordentlich dafür verlangt wird.\n",
      "24 oz. can poured a clear purple with a lingering ring of bubbles. Aromas of grape soda pop. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of grape soda pop with a crisp dry lingering artificial grape finish.\n",
      "Not meant to be chilled! Must be consumed just below room temperature. Room temperature is fine too. \n",
      "Tastes and smells like lychees, has a faint bitterness to it, mostly flavours and little bitters. Hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever tried. Aftertaste is alright. Don’t waste your money on all those marketing bs beers! This beer is brewed to taste good in the temperatures of Vietnam. There were no refrigerators in Vietnam when they started brewing! The cold suppresses sweet flavours so room temperature is best for drinking!\n",
      "Zajebiste piwko! Smakuje jak połączenie nektaru z orgazmem. Gówno prawda, to piwo to szczyny\n",
      "I don’t know what I was expecting, but this is is better than the Millers Chill. Quenches your thirst without getting pissed.\n",

      "Can't believe the high ratings this swill has gotten.  Absolutely abominable, possibly the worst beer in the history of the industry.  And i say that as a huge fan of Funky Buddha products.  I bought it as part of a 12 pack and choked down two of the three cans that were included.  Gagged so badly just dumped the third out.  Terrible. I can't think of three more hideous flavors for beer than cinnamon, vanilla and blueberries.  Seriously, this is like some kind of prank by devious brewers.\n",
      "To be drank with care.\n",
      "This a a top rate high strength beer that is just fantastic. To be sipped so you have to use a bit of self control if you are a normal beer drinker. I will always have a couple of bottles in. Brilliant value now in supermarkets.\n",
      "Murky reddish brown. UNclean aroma with plenty of unpleasant smoke phenols. Harsh bitterness.\n",
      "I didn't care for this much.  It had a strange sour flavor that just didn't sit well in my stomach. Disappointed in this one.\n",
      "Initial tasting notes:\n",
      "Rich, malty with notes of sewer rat.  Quite similar to a Newcastle that had gone warm and had homeless bathe in it for a few weeks.  Carbonation was apparent but did little to improve the drinkability of this thick drunk nectar.  A few sips in the taste started to improve.  No longer could taste the homeless who chose to cleanse themselves and get inebriated at the same time.  By the time I finished the first, it reminded me much more of a crisp coors original.  By this time the tape around both my hands was slowly cutting off circulation so drinking these rockets of awesomesauce helped ease the pain.  The second was pure gold.  10/10 would recommend to a friend.  This should not be drank without one being taped to each hand.\n",
      "Caramel taste with rye bread and coffee notes. Super dark colour and no beer foam, when you are pouring into a glass. Super!\n",
      "I try out this Colt 45 Beer, and it’s really good taste. One can with a cup of ice really knock me off to bed. Colt 45 with 8% it’s really worth a money for a day after hard work. Well done Colt 45/ 8% !\n",
      "WOW !! 5 Star.. this is an amazing beer, full of character and strength. This is how strong beer should be.\n",
      "Really lovely beer. Vanilla and citrus combined. Very refreshing, never seen the tv show but love this beer\n",
      "Tap. Read color. Medium size, pink head, stays. Acidic, raw battery acid, maybe raspberry too in aroma/taste. Not for me.\n",
      "Another one down the sink!!!. Please bring  back your great tasting beers!!!\n",
      "A word of advise, if you find this same can of Ta moins meilleur with all yellow label, don’t bother trying it!!! A complete different taste!\n",

      "Got this can from kroger kentucky. Nice place! Pick a mix six of untasted locals for $10? How cool is that? Right off the main 4 lane byway. Pour is a slightly darker orange yellow eye. Yes, strong, almost volatile cleaning fluid aroma of pine. Head fades to scum. Firz-sherz this stuff lets you know its higher than 6% right off the top. Rude, bitter IPA in character. Not refreshing. Does not hide alky well, even with lots of bitter resinous hops. Big impressive mouth coating bitter bullshit blastaway blastaway blast away all. Difficult on a second time round glug. Yes, beyond on style for a stronger APA but probably more like an IPA in nature. Nasty nellie negative experience. What else can be said? Terribly palte trashing on style for an IPA? Yea. What ever.\n",
      "Bottle @London Pub, Aalborg. Chocolate amd perfume aroma. Lots of chocolate and cocoa flavour. Sweet chocolate flavour. Synthetic. Not a favourite.\n",
      "Bottle from Elie. Many thanks! Dark brown/black colour, beige foam. Lots of coffee, roasted malts along with sweet hints of cinnamon, sugar, nuts. Sweet and spicy. Not my cup of tea.\n",
      "A very similar taste to Cisk Lager but with less carbs in it. Love the taste. This is an alternative to the Cisk lager as it has less carbs, but still great similar taste. Beer made in Malta 🇲🇹🍺\n",
      "I truly love this beer, very similar to Heineken/Budweiser. One of the best I had 🇲🇹🍺 A small tiny island in Europe can offer a great beer, very commercially known in Malta.\n",
      "750mL bottle, pours black with a huge tan, gushing head -- this must be infected. Aroma smells infected, with heaps of burnt rubber - nasty. Flavour thankfully smells better than it tastes, with burnt roasted malt, wood, and some burnt rubber. Very infected, lots of burnt rubber.\n",
      "i found it kind of harsh on my palate. not so much citrus but alcohol like and uncomfortable bitter. mild carbonation heave aftertaste.\n",
      "Great summertime beer. Happy when it’s released and sad to see it go. If you’re on a porch or a boat in the summertime, gotta have at least one.\n",
      "Refreshing and easy to drink, plenty of ginger comes through but without overpowering the delicate fruit flavor. The ginger is crisp and the cider isn’t cloyingly sweet. It’s well-balanced and fun to drink.\n",
      "May just be a maritimer opinion, but definitely the best beer I’ve ever drank\n",
      "This is the most cloyingly sweet, worthless marketing ploy of a beer that I've had from an otherwise solid brewery. Why make such beers, if they're hardly drinkable? It's like a decent flavored cider at best.\n",
      "Very nice crisp taste. I hope this does not get discontinued it's the only beer I drink.\n",
      "It’s a stretch to call this anything but a poor quality beer. Not worth a review.\n",
      "Miller High Life is not a small batch 'craft beer', and doesn't pretend to be.  It's a mass produced beer made for, well, 'the masses'.  It has a slightly sweet grainy flavor, with a touch of hops, and just a hint of bitter on the end.  For me, it's refreshing on a hot day, and goes great with pizza, tacos and popcorn.  It's also easier on the wallet.  \n",

      "OK, so here we go? Another ubiquitous IPA? I bet. And from this steeler color can I get a Pale yellow orange brew that is astringent and fricken terribly bitter from the start, whew. This is not IPa!! Its double imperial IPA! WOOOWEEEEE! You know, the asian communication super power? Really feels a lot more like 7 or 8%. So, if you really like IPA, don't take it as an insult, just flip my numbers, its one nasty nellie beer you need to try, bucket list this one.\n",
      "Aus der Flasche (bbe 21.02.2020) im 2019-08 getrunken. Oh nein - bei dieser deutlichen Bitterkeit durch den Hopfen werden wir keine Freunde. Auch beim Weizenaromer kommt ein leicht, seifiges Aroma auf. Nein das brauche ich nicht mehr im Glas!\n",
      "12 ounce bottle, 5% ABV. Chilled. A really poor beer. Tastes like a flat club soda with a half teaspoon of Hershey's chocolate powder stirred in. Sorry, didn't do anything for me, and I'm generally pretty forgiving. Keep looking, you do not want this.\n",
      "Super drinkable, tasty, easy to find, not pricey. Doesn't have the same flavour that mars most belgian whites. One of the best\n",
      "Best ipa in Florida they nailed it very smooth. Go to a location for awesome atmosphere and a great food menu. Also reef donkey is amazing.\n",
      "Quite possibly the worst pumpkin beer I’ve ever had.  I left them in my fridge for over a year, as filler beer because I paid for them, ha ha, and they actually did get better tasting than the previous year but nothing like pumpkin tasting\n",
      "I've worked my way thru the Sampler Pak now and I can tell you:  the \"A\" in Alaskan stands for \"ACID\"\n",
      "Every one of their beers is loaded up with acid (probably citric acid?) so they can be \"crisp\"\n",
      "They aren't fooling anybody.\n",
      "Alaskan is not a real brewer.\n",
      "Nice Dutch beer which is definitely worth a taste but I wouldn’t buy this beer as a regular drink\n",
      "Tasting at Erik's, canHazy golden colour. Strange aroma, fruit, rotten fruit, meat, candied pineapple. One sip, just one, almost choked on that, artificial pineapple, with unbearable pithy bitterness\n",
      "Taste like it was brewed with dirty gym socks and coal dust. I'm just glad I didn't die drinking the one beer. I gave the rest of the rancid trash to my neighbor that I didnt like. I paid like $12 for a 6 pack of this dog water because I thought the box looked cool. I'll stick with beer that doesnt taste like a puked in a bottle then attempted to drink it.\n",
      "My new favorite!!!!  I'm not much of a drinker but I'm so glad I tried this!    Light and crisp, it  goes down easy and doesn't fill me up so I still have plenty of room for wings!  Love love love the fresh orange taste, not covered up by the beer taste, just the right blend!  Thank you!!!!\n",
      "It is certainly fragrant and feels ok, but looks as it tastes - like a can of lilt that has been opened and left to go flat. That's not beer.\n",
      "Can honestly say one of the most disappointing beers I've ever tasted. Vinegar on the nose, thin unappealing  body and the taste of fermented cabbage water. If this is the answer I'm not sure what was the question...\n",
      "Give me a bucket of this beer and I'll stick my head in. 10/10 Can be drunk like water\n",
      "Superb taste, and look, small brewery but very big results, would definitely recommend.\n",

      "Bekommt von mir auf jeden Fall die volle Punktzahl. Ein Alkoholfreies so gut hinzubekommen, das es besser schmeckt als die meisten mit Alkohol ist eine Kunst. Schöner  fruchtiger und starker Hopfengeruch und kaum bitter. Genau so mag ich das.\n",
      "Darker amber color, beige head. Aroma is heavy cinnamon, nutmeg, brown candy sugar. Flavor is sweet, again heavy heavy herbal, spices, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown candy sugar, liquor. Heavy and herbal / spicy is what dominates. Unfortunately: totally not my thing. I really don't like this. 3-3-3-3-7.\n",

      "Can. Stone Berlin edition. It pours a clear straw colored body under a creamy, two-finger white head. Lacing. The aroma has loads of green apples or unripe apples, some grass and frozen vegetable mix. It's medium bodied, nicely carbonated and quite dry, with the same gentle amounts of unripe and green apples. Some notes of pale malts. Lasting finish. Shite, this was surprisingly unpleasant. 190906\n",
      "Where is ok and there is a few notes of fruit but not a lot compared to other craft beers. Your parents was a bit of a letdown as well as the palates, and I was expecting a bit more from the bit that I had tasted. But this seems ok compared to some beers.\n",

      "Rich, robust flavor. No gimmicky flavors, no fruits or seasonal spices. Pure beer for pure beer drinkers. Just the right ABV. Found this beer in early 2018. Every batch is consistent, just a great taste to look forward to everyday.\n",

      "Bottle.  Golden, clear, headless.  Sweet, sugar-corn aroma.  Virtually flavorless, just a smidgen of corn-laden malt, nothing in the background, no backbone.  Disappointing.  (#7532, 9/2019)\n",

Back before all this \" touch of orange, pussy willow bark, and cinnamon \" junk drinks that these hipsters try to call beer! Come on ! Drink it, put hair on your chest !!\n",
      "Pours copper colour with average head. Way over hopped, and too aromatic. Has aroma of herbs. Sour bitter herby finish to it.\n",
      "My usual inexpert review - nice Belgian blonde, I think my favourite beer on this visit. The bottle I had said it was brewed by Strubbe. When I last had it in 2016, also in Lafayette, the bottle said brewed by Fort Lapin. Koolschip obviously shop around when commissioning their beers.\n",
      "It hits the spot.  Better than most malt liquors out there right now. I think it has a great flavor and the price is unbeatable.  I highly recommend it. It's better than old English that's for sure\n",
      "12 oz. can from the Mansion. Pours a pitch black color with a tight beige head and very good retention. Good lacing. Aroma of roasted chocolate and booze. Flavor starts out a little roasted and black licorice and then any/all flavor is washed away by the 12.0% ABV. Actually the 12% ABV is hidden better than I expected, but it still numbs all other flavors.\n",
      "My usual ignorant review.  4/5 for the bottle I am enjoying.  Nice, dark Belgian beer.\n",
      "OK, so I got an IPA that apparently is a 99/100? No IPA is that good. Come now, bitter bastard. Let me put this 100% in the glass. Pours like a decent beer, pale yellow with a big foaming craggy head. Mild clean fresh hop flower perfume aroma. Taste is one big mouth coating bitter brutal butyl rubber chewy inner tube. Yes, a blast in the ass. Heat of the meat divided by the angle of dangle. What else can be said? So bitter it is probably a double IPA? Or ... ..... do I mean impy? Yes, terribly on style nasty fricken nellie, whew. Not sure if I got this at JR's or the kroger in kentucky. Only $1.50 for one of the finest? Heheheh\n",
      "Nice Belgian bottle fermented blonde beer. Brewed by Anders (for Wenbrew Beer) not Strubbe. I would rate it as 4/5. Blame the 0.5 rating on Rate beer.\n",

      "The greatest beer in all of Croatia. Knocks  the other lagers put of the park.\n",
      "Sehr süßer Beginn. Himbeeren, sehr künstlich, unsüffig. Muss nicht sein. 10/6/7/6/6\n",
      "I’ve had a lot of beer around the world, and while it’s better in Europe, this is by far my favorite in the States!  Very smooth with a crisp coffee flavor with just a hint of vanilla!\n",
      "I was surprised to taste a new castle that tastes like the regular crap brown ales made in the US . I then found out new castle was bought by Lagunitas which also makes crap beer. So, looks like  I'll find something else to purchase other than this shite\n",
      "Pours dark brown. \n",
      "Aroma of alcohol and sugar. Taste is the same with hints of caramel. It tastes like vodka and beer\n",
      "I bought this because it was highly ranked [only]. Crystal clear coloured body with a thick, three centimetre tall off-white head, a bit tan and quite soapy throughout. Aroma of grass, hay, light metal, some funk and cardboardie malt and a dash of peppery hops on the end. Light-bodied; Very strong pungent lager yeast flavours up front with biscuits, crackers and grain very strong with some light lemons and pungent grass throughout that leaves this quite astringent on the end. Aftertaste is very deep and bitter - mainly from the grassy malts and the lager yeast - these are very strong and don't go away at all. Overall, a fairly strong pilsener that is very typical for an American beer, just sadly, from Macro-producers; This doesn't taste like a craft beer at all - it could be from SABMiller or In-Bev and you wouldn't even know at all. This one definitely isn't worth trying at all, especially as one that is somehow deemed to be 'respectable' by others. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 23-August-2019 for US$2,49 sampled very fresh on 02-September-2019 at home in Washington.\n",
      "12 oz. can. Waiting for Hurricane Dorian. Pours a cloudy copper color with a large khaki head and very good retention.  Very good lacing.  Very strong hops aroma. All hops flavor and bitter, but not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be for 103 IBU. And the 8.0% ABV is pretty well hidden too. But it's still just another bitter beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different taste, not impressed, not worth the money, think Bush lite is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refreshing, without being too sweet.  Also like it’s 6.9%!  My husband liked it too and is searching where to purchase so we can enjoy at home.\n",
      "I wanted to like this so badly, but from when I first picked it up and smelled it, to the first sip and each one thereafter, it reminded me quite viscerally of my community indoor pool. It had such a strong chlorine smell and taste that despite it having a gorgeous color, I couldn’t drink it without thinking I was drinking pool water. I’m not much of a beer person, so I have no idea what people are talking about by calling it strong. It barely tasted like beer.\n",
      "Not sure why anyone decided to seal this brew in a bottle and label it.  But if you have ever sipped on a r of vinegar and thought, “Wish I could get a buzz of this.”  This is your beer\n",
      "12-oz can from craftbeertemple side-by-side with BA. gusher, ugh, chemical and chocolate nose, full body, chocolate, chemical, faint chile when tasted for it, dark fruit finish.\n",
      "Having one at Café Löwe in Neunkirchen/Germany.\n",
      "Golden clear with a thin head.\n",
      "Malty smell. Got it served ice cold which comes good at the current weather conditions. As with most low alcohol beers, this one is maltier than its alcoholic counterpart. Low carbonation.\n",
      "Southern Pines is loosing more ground by the day. This is a train wreck of a beer. I dont even know what it is supposed to be.  Ugly nasty murky brown peach colored pour. Looks like baby vomit. Aroma of old lady's night musk from 1962. Perfume like. Tastes god aweful. It tastes like old perfume.  Wino's and homeless alcoholics would not drink this. Nobody should have to. The worst excuse for beer I've seen in a while.. except for some of Southern Pines other nasty creations.\n",
      "still looking for the hops in this beer, totally different from what I expected, wouldn't even consider this an IPA\n",

      "Let's review the last few years of SN's \"octoberfest\" beers:\n",
      "\n",
      "2015 - tried it and it was ok, LOTS of hops (in an Octoberfest which is KNOWN for its malt???)\n",
      "2016 - even MORE hops than 2015\n",
      "2017 - 150 lbs of hops in each bottle, even tho' Ofests are to be malty.  Too much hops and NO FLAVOR.\n",
      "2018 - same thing - HOPSHOPSHOPSHOPS.  decent, but horribly wrong.\n",
      "2019 - last chance SN, can you learn that Ofest is a malty beer???\n",
      "\n",
      "Nope.  2019 is ALL HOPS, an orange - YES ORANGE - color (their catering to the pumpkin goofs??) and a weak aroma and head.  The taste is sharp, like hot sauce, and has NO MALT AT ALL.  All the reviewers who say it is \"malty\" are using their HOPS-favoring tongue.  IT IS NOT MALTY AT ALL.  I will never buy SN again.  Wow.  SN has no idea that beer is hops  AND  malt.   worthless craftie mess.  this is a HORRIBLE \"Octoberfest\" mess.\n",
      "Tap. Pours pink. Aroma and flavor are sour, acidic, fruits, cardboard. Overall: hell no, I guess brothers has a now crafty competitor in the crap cider market...\n",
      "Lightly hazy maize. No head. Lime, strawberry, rhubarb, and hay on the nose. Mildly sour. Medicinal. Nice soft mouthfeel. Trays like some witches brew. Not very good.\n",
      "Very good aroma, nice bitterness and heavy taste exactly how a beer should be.\n",
      "Poured from12oz bottle from sampler pack. Pours a hazy golden color. Thin, dissipating head with little lacing. Notes of fruit and cloves. Carbonation is very noticeable in the mouthfeel. An okay beer, but not something I would pickup a standalone six pack of.\n",
      "No aftertaste. Very plain, zero depth in taste. My final rating refers to the percentage of alcohol.\n",
      "Clear golden pour with a thick white foam head. Melon like aroma. Tastes like melon and some burnt plastic. Definite drain pour here. No good.\n",
      "Dark color, middle foam size. Good beer, aroma and taste fit into the style.\n",
      "Is it wrong to say Bud Light is OK? Sitting here on a cruise ship enjoying a light refreshing beer!\n",
      "Wednesday, August 28, 2019. On tap, 12.5cL. 9.5%. @bar \"Le Grincheux\", Strasbourg (67), FR. A sparkling black-brown beer with a nice oily-look beige creamy head ; good retention and lacing ! Beautiful! Coffee+, toast+ (burnt!?), light bourbon, woody character, black chocolate, light sugar, light water. Medium round sweet, light warming, lack of wingspan !!??, light spicy, light bitter note. Fat thin body, thin oily texture, flat, toasted coffee bourbon finish. Overall, disappointing ! At least, that's coherent with what I remember of the classic \"Péché Mortel\". Still a mystery... Moreover, I smelt bad flavors near the tram while tasting this beer at the bar.\n",

      "See, the thing that most people fail to consider, is the price, and the history. Does High life stack up to some of the IPAs around now? Of course not. The recipe for high life was invented before our great grandparents were even born. And on top of that, at 1 dollar for a 24OZ can, it's pretty much the best in it's class. There is no other beer *in this price range* that can compare whatsoever. And even a little over as well. No, this beer will not knock your socks off, but typically the brews that do are 4-5 bucks a pop. Is high life the champagne of ALL beers? Of course not! Is it the champagne of beers (in it's class)? Absolutely.\n",
      "Pours clear with a thick fluffy white head. Aroma of acerbic malt. Taste has very light floral notes. Palate is almost nonexistent. Bad.\n",
      "In a world of hipster IPA's, this beer is a refreshing, easy drinking, not bitter American Lager... simple. Sometimes it's just fine to sit down and enjoy the mellow, smooth, unpretentious lighter flavor of Miller High Life. If it was bad like many of the reviewers here have said, I very much doubt it would have stayed in production since 1903. Enjoy it for it's own tradition and don't go at it like it's failing to be one of the over-hopped micro-brews of the week. Some of us just don't pretend.\n",
      "June 2019 Backlog. Can shared with Brendan and Paul. Pours a muddled amber. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, harsh alcohol, dull hop, strong malt, sugar and bitter grapefruit.\n",
      "I like cream ale and malty flavor. In my opinion, this is a very good beer.\n",
      "Sampled at Brewskival 2019. Black. Intense cloying vanilla, milk chocolate aroma. Full bodied. Very sweet.\n",
      "Can from beer52 had at home bb 030919\n",
      "Hazy beer lovely white head slight citrus smell\n",
      "Not very over powering citrus taste\n",
      "In the early years of this brewery, the owner would give the tours himself.  He told the story of finding a can of really cheap beer in the back of the fridge and asked him what it was for.  \"That's for guzzling after I mow the lawn\".  So he came up with Fancy Lawnmower beer because 'life is too short to drink bad beer'.  It really is good after mowing the yard, and on any warm day.  By itself, in a pint glass, it's good.  Guzzled out of the bottle or can after you mow the yard, it's superb.  They used to have Weedeater variation, it was even better.  Wish they still had that.\n",
      "Wernesgrüner Pils has a very thick, off-white head, a clear, straw appearance, with white sediment chunks, lots of bubbles, and prominent lacing. The aroma is of cracker and white bread crust. Taste is similar, with grass and bold bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Wernesgrüner Pils finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT\n",
      "Eau bénite imbibée de grâce et infusée par la lumière d'une tradition flamande immémoriale, titrant au chiffre magique de 8.5% qu'elle exprime en proportions irrationnelles, saturée d'un gros nectar de douce sagesse, un bouquet ravageur pour un bouleversement gustatif radical en bouche - Cet élixir vous transcendera irrémédiablement, propulsant l'esprit vers un nouvel horizon de plénitude hébétée.\n",
      "I should have known - BEFORE - I tried this beer.  But, I tried it anyway.\n",
      "Not too much hops, although a few ratings said it was \"like\" a Pilsner. The hops wasnt as bad as I expected, thankfully.  What is bad is the \"floral/fruity\" taste.  WTF???  Its a beer, not a candle.  WTF will USA crafties stop this stupid love affair with hops/spices/fruits/knitted aprons in their \"beers\"?????  I will never buy this crap again.  Oh, am I supposed to describe the foam head and its \"lacing\"?  Does that make me a \"real\" beer expert??  WTF? The experts with German beers are ignored by the diaper wearing \"experts\" in the USA craftie BS breweries. Wake up, its a beer, not your Grandma's spice cake.\n",
      "As good as it gets. Refreshing and light yet with a slight honey taste that gives it body. My go to pint up north\n",

      "Sampled on draft this beer poured a golden color with a medium sized foamy yellow white head that left good lacing. The aroma was faint fruit, perfume and pine. The flavor was fairly watery with faint fruit, perfume and pine. Medium length finish. Thin body.\n",
      "Bought at the brewery in Nantucket.  Do not like this at all.  This is not a saison farmhouse ale.  It’s more like a shandy or Long Island iced tea!  Way too much citrus.  I love Cisco, but this was undrinkable for me.  It went down the drain.  That’s pretty rare for me.\n",
      "Absolutely fantastic drink, very strong, but also very easy drinking. Plenty of oak aftertaste & tannins.\n",
      "Keg at Euston Tap, London. Wow. This basically tastes like a mouthful of peardrops... I&aposm not sure what else to say.\n",
      "A grown up Amber. Has a very full flavor. No bitter aftertaste. A very good Amber. Perhaps one of the best Ambers.\n",
      "In general one of the darker IPA's. Much bitter as a IPA, but the classic fruityness I lacking a bit in my opinion.\n",
      "Bottle from JRs.  Windy whiny mild sweet hops candy nose. Thick rich gooey IPA with a viscous resinous mouth coating effect. This must be an imperial IPA, no lie. Clear pale yet much like old time IPA. Yass, nassty ferr sher. One kick my ass punch my mouthful of an IPA, butyl rubbery straight up ass. Same with finish, what else can be said about this warming fluid? WTF? What-ever.\n",
      "Love it, my favourite beer personally, fruity taste, best in a bottle with a orange wedge\n",
      "Pleasant non-offensive lager. Especially enjoyable as a light alcohol beer at lunch or with dinner. Non bitter aftertaste if any ar all. Slightly carbonated.\n",
      "A suprize as it is brewed for the German supermarket chain LIDL. It was a gift but I would purchase this light lager again.\n",
      "Great Beer when its too hot, first pint goes down great, just what the doctor ordered. 2nd pint started to get a bit gasses towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stop at 2 and you will come back to it on a regular basis\n",
      "This beer gave my husband a massive allergy and I had pretty nearly heartburn from it. Tried it several months later and had the same problem. Tried again just in case it was a fluke. Something is not quite right with this blend.\n",
      "The new version of Newcastle is terrible. Lagunitas has ruined it with their \"re-imagination.\" I couldn't be more disappointed. For nearly a decade my favorite beer has been Newcastle, and I initially didn't mind thinking they had a newly shaped bottle. But the first taste was \"bad\", to be kind. I was thinking burned batch or somesuch. I tried it again and I was thinking worse...they've ruined it. I taste bad bark and twigs and nasty bitter hoppiness. I won't be drinking this. My new favorite is DIXIE, oddly enough I live in Alabama, but DIXIE is from New Orleans. Try DIXIE, if you can find it. Lagunitas \"re-imagining\" Newcastle is like somebody \"touching up\" the Mona Lisa, with crayons, candle wax and magic markers. Bad idea.\n",
      "Draft at Trails End Taproom in Colorado Springs, CO. Pitch black color with no head. As expected, this is a coffee dominant flavor. Smooth. The 7.3% ABV is well hidden. Great flavor if you like coffee, but I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't understand how this beer has such poor scores. It's smooth, crisp and refreshing. I'm not a fan of IPA's and super hoppy and bitter beer. I prefer Belgians, Stouts and Amber ales. From taste alone I'd think this beer had an abv no higher than 5.5%. It's strong and enjoyable to drink. I think it's as close to the perfect beer as possible. Not sure why others don't seem to feel the same way? To each his own and to me Honey Hips is the bees knees.\n",

      "Textbook example of how a Pilsner should taste like. Light & crisp with the perfect amount of bitterness without being too heavy. I’m in love\n",
      "This beer reminds me of the Titanic - big, bold, smooth.. and extremely sinkable ! Put a hole in it.. she goes straight down! \n",
      "It has everything you could possibly want from a beer.. or life in general. Crisp Cardboard. Sweet Hops. this beer is best paired with more Canadian Molson. \n",
      "On the 10th day of ascension.. Jesus Christ split bread and handed out tins to those gathered on Mount Molson. \"drink yee thy Canadian goodness\". \n",

      "0,33 fles vind ik anders smaken .\n",
      "Decent tasting IPA. Aroma of pineapple. Doesn't really have the ordinary taste of the IPA.\n",
      "Not sure what I've got here, but I don't think it's the right beer. Can says \"The Other Brian,\" but what I have is a dark brown (it almost looks like it's dark blue or maybe even purple?), muddy-looking beer with almost no head. Aroma and flavor are fruity and it almost seems like there might be some seeds or seed remnants floating in this. Is this some sort of mis-canned fruit beer or sour IPA?\n",
      "Hey, I thought I rated this already, you know, just another ubiquitous IPA?  Volatile mild hop whiff. Foamy head, hazy of course. Full body with strong hop bitter ballish bite. Yes, another ubiquitous IPA, what else can be said? What? You want more robust, malty, and alcoholic with a characteristically intense hop profile in both taste and aroma? Whoop, here it is.\n",
      "An exact Clone for the Spanish classic Estrella for a fraction of the cost. Budget price premium flavour and quality. A must to buy.\n",
      "his beer is terrible. It's so sweet it makes you want to puke. It's not the worst beer I've ever had, however it comes close. I've been retching as I drink it, trying to be able to describe what the hell is going on with this thing. I recently tried a mango/habanero beer, which inspired me to try fruity combinations, otherwise I might have stayed away from this one. The inspirational beer in question combined a mild fruit flavor with a timid spice that kicked it up a bit while still keeping it's yeasty roots. \n",
      "\n",
      "this beer doesn't understand subtlety. It just throws in a mass amount of fruit flavoring in the beer and drowns out any actual \"beer\" flavor. If it wasn't for the disgusting aftertaste, I would just assume this was a fruit juice. And about that aftertaste...It is literally one of the worst I have ever had. Like, tequila burns bad and tastes worse, but the flavor I would associate with this beer is beyond that, It makes me want to puke just sipping it with no alcohol in my system.\n",
      "My wife picked up a 6 pack of cans of this from the shoprite to host our neighbors, not knowing i was handling the beer. Lets just say, after one taste, it never saw the light of day at that party. Tastes like honey brown lager. No hops. Metallic feel.  Gives cans a bad name, and i like cans. Its light. So maybe id crack one open at a tailgate, but otherwise i wont recommend if you want an ipa. Who am i kidding, ill finish them, but no more. Long time reader, first time poster. Just not a fan.\n",
      "Pours clear dark amber. Falls short of being significantly memorable. Finding this ordinary.\n",
      "Pours cloudy yellow. Bready wheat beer, not real interesting. Not a beer for me.\n",
      "As the label states, hoppy with citrus overtones. Pleasant caramel hanging finish. Nice head... without doubt THE BEST Pale Ale I've tasted! And I have been beer tasting for over 42 years!\n",
      "Something seriously wrong with this one. Perhaps it's well past freshness. Really tastes like green onion gone bad. Vegetable matter. Pours murky orange with good head and lacing. Bitter leafy finish. I can't remember ever having a Bellwoods beer this bad. Tap at Churchkey.\n",
      "Maybe I got an old can of this but it tasted awful and old. I've drain poured worse beers than this. Smells like rotting apricots and looks like piss from a dehydrated camel. Were it not for the fact I paid $2 for the can at a bottle shop up the street, I would've chucked it on principal.\n",

      "I saw this about a year ago at my local liquor store. I have been steady drinking it daily since then. It was really good in the beginning, but it is starting to drop off a little bit these days. Its a good Michelada if that's what you got a hankering for.\n",
      "On tap at Phil’s Burgers, Uppsala, Sweden. Aroma foul chemicals. Appearance pale gold with little head. Taste poor, grassy. Palate medium carbonation with medium bubbles. Finish ok. Overall the strong chemical aroma ruins it.\n",

      "Cloudy milky light beige beer, no head. Aroma: spicy, cloves, floral, overripe fruits, orange peel, sugary impression, pretty weird, cake batter, funky. MF: ok carbon, medium body.

      "\n",
      "Just too much.\n",
      "Pours black with a very slight tan head. Aroma of raspberry with dark malt. Taste has bitter chocolate elements, raspberry and hops. Palate is dominated by burnt hop notes, alcohol burn. Hard to drink.\n",
      "Draft. ultra-hazed pour, aorma is sweet fruit cocktail, flavor is canned pineapple, sweet and over the top, not great.\n",
      "Rousse qui se boit merveilleusement bien, belle couleur, excellente dans un souper entre amis\n",
      "Très bonne brune, belle couleur, goût caractéristique des brunes avec goût de noix\n",
      "This is just a tick cause I knew it would be another ubiquitous rude ass ale from the start. Mild BO nose on tap at JR's. Hazy pale. Taste is of course is highly bitter, bordering on astringent. Imperial wheat ale? It's dad was probably an arrogant IPA. Yes, nasty on style unbalanced wheat IPA. What else can be said? Disappointing for a lager lover. A punch? Maybe a citrus punch, don't think party punch here.\n",
      "H-u-u-uge frothy head. A mouthful of mixed hops that does not disappoint. This is a great IPA!\n",
      "Appeared in the glass as a fragrantly roasted black stout & anticipation was high. Roasted flavor at first, quickly turns to something odd & offensive. Hard to put my finger on just what it is, but I believe it's salt from the peanut butter. Not tasting any peanuts by the way either. Second attempt turns foul too. \"Gruesome\" is an appropriate term, this is awful stuff!\n",

      "This was part of a sample pack that I picked up at the grocery store. I had seen favorable reviews of this beer, and was looking forward to trying it. Sadly, it’s not what I expected. Upon deeper examination, it might be one of the hops that doesn’t work for me. I’ve never liked Mozaic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer pours a straw to golden color, with a thin white head. The color is a little hazy. But I’m a homebrewer, so a little haze doesn’t bother me (we are talking about an ale, right?). \n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is where I first notice the Mozaic hops. Very dank, and not pleasant at all. Like a cat’s litter box. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste isn’t any better. Not bad, if I drink it fast enough. If I try to enjoy it, the whole litter box sensation comes back and I’m like, “Why do I keep doing this to myself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I once had a six pack of another ale featuring Mozaic hops. And I found that if I forgot about it in the basement for about six months, the dank had faded and I was left with something drinkable. I think I’ll do the same with the remainders from this sample pack. \n",

      "Doughy pils malt with a touch of melanoidin development. Faint herbal hop aroma. Clean and crisp. Great balance and depth and still elegant. Bright gold with persistent white head. Silky mouthfeel.\n",
      "bottle @ Marino's Beverage Depot --- 07/20/18 --- Aroma of malt and candied fruit.  Hazy amber-brown color, beige head that disappears, lace strips.  Taste is somewhat flat caramel malt with a bit of dried fruit, minimal carbonation, then a smooth uneventful run to a medium finish.  This is the four of four in a pack that I've rasted, with three of them being noticeably past date.  Sometimes I skip rating these, but, I think that if the brewer and seller are willing to take my money, I'll rate what comes out of the bottle.\n",
      "Apple Brandy Barrel Dark Apparition - Bottle. Dark brown pour with almost be head. Brown sugar bouquet. Sour?  Infected??  Sour berry noted dominate the sweet caramels. No bueno.\n",
      "I just do not like this and I love IPA's. If it's the only IPA available to order I drink something else.\n",

      "very tasty flavour raspberry and blackberry and not sour at all and nice 360 can and only 3.5%\n",
      "Ok, so I have never been this site before, just wanted to check out some reviews of this beer because, seriously I was SO impressed this beer is dame good since I GOT 6 PACK at 99 Cent Store!!! for measly $2.99!!! which makes this cheaper than ANYTHING! I am definitely sure this is not some craft IPA, but dang this is better than anything that is 50 cents a can! Cheaper than a can or Coors or f'in Budweiser! so for that. it definitely deserves 4.5 stars on my book! WTF 99 cent store Double IPA?!?! yes, this gets you drunk, and for this cheap, no complaints, period. I would happily pay couple bucks more for these, maybe. (or eh... maybe not.)\n",

      "22nd August 2019Level 6 Bottleshare. Thanks to LKS and the team. Hazy gold beer, small white head. Light crisp palate, fairly dry. Sour and edgy lemon. Tart finish. One dimensional lemon. Smooth? My arse!\n",
      "Tap (TCBW2018) (5:3:3:1:6=1.8)\n",
      "Very sour berry aroma. Aggressively sour vinegary palate, burns my gums. Can't get past the vinegar, no thanks.\n",
      "I'm serious, I'm so fricken sick of IPA. Everybody told me my palate had to mature to like IPA. I tell you; you are so immature for following the fad. I almost want to give up ticking beers here, but I know there are many sours, witbier, berliner and wild to be found, which are pure and are not bastardized  by the IPA style.....there you have it.  There are absolutely a brazillion IPA out there that taste exactly the same.  Bitter, nasty rude ass in yer face impact. And, that's what this is; a big juicy mouthcoating stupid ass hop blundering blast. Let me think; I see & feel a jumbo jetliner of hops yet, it does not set me free; f-off!  Git widdit; If I drink an IPA, it better be a big alky content bombardier to make me forget about the bitterness, and this does not. Sick of it. IPA that is. Go figger. You think craft beer will ever turn into what it once was: Special? Did I smell weed? Just asking mah-fah. I am indifferent to its hazy pale color and stupid straight up canyon ass ipa nose.\n",

      "A bitter disappointment - and not in a good way. Did Heineken took away all the flavour and hops?\n",
      "20/08/2019 @home - 50cl can from a Lidl near Monshchau.\n",
      "Clear golden, medium fading head. Nose is fruity malts, yeast. Taste is sweet malts, hint of bitterness, bit rotten yeast, couldn’t finish a 50cl, but hey, that wasn't the plan either. Awful.\n",
      "This beer is cheap and great! If you don’t like IPA beers then this probably isn’t for you. This is a great pregame beer. Also a beer on the budget that gets the job done. Who doesn’t like a little buzz of a beer. Cheers!\n",
      "Pours golden with a fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet tea. Taste has ridiculously sweet lemon notes with some artificial make-at-home tea notes. Palate is the exact same as lemon dish detergent. Terrible.\n",
      "i don't like it. i love the brewer but it is altogether too winey for me. The wine taste completely overwhelms this brew. And i can go to a wine site for that...and i won't.\n",
      "Canned. Clear amber body, big beige head. The aroma has copper. The taste is like old butter. Pretty nasty.\n",
      "Très bon stout, belle couleur beau col, agréable en bouche. Découverte au Faste Fou de Trois-Rivières\n",
      "A little hesitant to try this one. Out of a $3 can from vintage this stuff smells a little volatile & coffee. Strong & beefy is the first taste. Coffee fer sher. At first it seems to have less alky than expected but then I start to feel the effects.  Coffee magnus. Mellowing near the middle. Gets more difficult in the end, almost becomes medicinal in its presentation.\n",
      "A beautiful beer. Really fruity. Wasn’t expecting it after the  aroma. No hint of the wonderful unexpected taste. Not as strong as the alcohol content suggests. Would be fabulous with a barbecue I would imagine.\n",
      "Amazing how many times I've had this beer, yet only now have rated it. Short-lived tan head on top of a clear Amber body. The smell is mild. It has good flavors and no bad aftertaste but there's no bold distinct flavors. All in all it's a great beer, but it's not an exceptional beer\n",
      "worst beer ive had in my life, almost puked, i took 5 sips and pour it into sink.\n",
      "Tap (TCBW2018) as \"Denmark in the Desert\" at 7.4%  (5:4:3:1:6=1.9)\n",
      "Commercial description mentioned barrel aging and apricot as well as peach - unsure exactly which of the Denmark in the Desert fuckups this actually is on RB. Roasty aroma, but bretty and sweaty. Dark brown, beige ead settles to a ring. Full in the mouth, but a crazily sour taste, basically battery acid. Basically undrinkable. Your beer's gone off, dude, and you don't appear to realise it. What do you mean that's deliberate - that's just a different type of stupid.\n",
      "Tap (TCBW2018) at 8.7% (4:4:3:3:7=2.1)\n",
      "Burnt toasty aroma from the roasted malts. Black, small tight tan head. Unpleasantly ashy and burnt rotasty taste, leaves me with nothing but burnt ashtray. Barely drinkable.\n",
      "Tastes more like sweet tea than an actual IPA. No hop forward taste, but a huge, round sweetness with just a touch of bitter on the way down. Had to pour out the glass after two swigs. Should not be advertised as even being stored in the same cooler as an IPA. Bummer.\n",

      "As a resident of Mansfield, TX, I feel like I needed to try the Best Maid Pickles & Martin House Brewing Company, as Best Maid calls Mansfield home. I really wanted to love it and, surprise, I do! I couldn’t sit back and drink a 6-pack, but this is actually quite good. I will caution anyone who doesn’t like pickles or the flavor and essence of pickle juice, because you most assuredly will not enjoy this. This would definitely be a great addition to the cooler for a cookout. Lastly, I appreciate the slogan they’ve slapped on the can: “Made in Texas by Texans”. I will definitely seek this out again 👍🏻\n",
      "If it was my last meal, I would want this beer to be part of it. If I could only have one item as that meal, this would be it.\n",
      "Très bon stout, belle couleur noire, avec un bon col, bon goût de stout sans trop gouter le café\n",
      "The average rating is far too low. It is a pretty decent lager. Pours a clear golden colour with a thin white head. Good taste, very pleasant.\n",
      "OK, I'm really looking forward to this $3 can from vintage. If it is what it says, it should taste great! High hopes, like the ant and the rubbertree plant. Near clear pale with a nice foamy head, almost goes crag. Oddart  nose like a typical say-zee. First taste is disappointing, tartness is hard to find behind the saison farm effects. Becomes medicinal in the middle. Yes, its over seven and you know it, not bones about it. They should put more lemongrass in this one. Needs to be restyled as an imperial saison, heheheh.  Difficult finish, wheew.\n",
      "Absolute rubbish, cheap not cheerful. I dont recommend anyone to try these. Worst beer ever\n",
      "Love this Beer, great beer to drink any day and all day. great colour and aroma and appreciate the bigger bottles.\n",
      "My favorite beer from New Ontario. Great Belgian style beer with a nice hint of fruits. I give it 5 stars all day long\n",
      "Another Great Beer by New Ontario! Good beer in any weather. I've had this in growlers, cans and on tap and it never disappoints.\n",
      "Great Blonde,  Not trying to be too fancy, just nice and easy drinking. Perfect for any occasion from a bonfire to BBQ dinner and poolside.\n",
      "Best of the Weissbier available. Cloves and coriander evident from first sip. Bubbly on the tongue. If you are a wheat beer fan, you must try this one!\n",
      "Tap (Siboire Saint-Laurent, Montreal). Hazy yellow color. Tiny size, white head, stays as a ring. Toilet, sour, minerals in aroma/taste. Nope.\n",
      "Medium to dark pour. Wheat and barley nose. Hoppy, mainstream tasting beer.\n",
      "So easily drinkable with good enough fizzy feeling. Has corn sugar or syrup smell but not so big. It’s gentle. Taste good with a bit of lemon juice\n",
      "Can $2 at vintage. How does a brewer get off by making 5 beers that are pretty much the same but will call them a new name? Just put all these straight up ass IPA dank beers in the same name, darn-it!  Slight haze on  pale. Big fat head from a quick pour in mug. Smell is typical big fresh volatile hops or what-ever that volatile perfumy flower thang is. Yes, taste is bordering on imperial india pale ale. Big blast in the face. Stank mango, mosaic, diggity, passion, pineapple, frank, WHAT-EVER??!! They all taste the same. WTF? I won't be fooled by this odd side again for a tick of something I already had 5 times over. Rubber mouth coating sappy finish. Come on, put them into the same name, since they are pretty much the same. JUST DANK!\n",

      "Das Bier schmeckt tatsächlich nach Dortmund, nach tiefgreifenden strukturellen Problemen und einer universalen Ödnis in der trending urbane Lifestyle Heinis irgendetwas mit identitätsstiften Logos ungeachtet des Geschmacks konsumieren.\n",
      "Tap (Angleterre, Helsinki) (4:2:3:2:6=1.7)\n",

      "Sweet coffee beans aroma. Worse beany taste. Medium palate, a bit slick. Too beany, don't like at all.\n",
      "This seems to be the absolute best American porter I have tried to date, but I would recommend trying it up against Portland Brewing's best porter at the moment. I would go so far as admitting this beer could be a better choice than Fuller's for my next porter pack purchase. Smoooooth, excellent taste.\n",
      "OK, another stupid ass can of $2 IPA from vintage and another hero from rev; a double FTW wammy. I got to learn to pass these bastards up when I see  them, I don't really do it for the tick anymore because I hate the flavor of these straight up ass IPA thangs.  Anyway the taste is bitterly astringent just like any other hero shitcan. Come on, how many beers are you gonnah make with the exact same taste and name them 54 different beers? Somebody, administration,  please control these IPA.  I am so tired of these things they almost make me gag. Its so fricken bitter and mouth coating, it probably should be listed as a imperial IPA. Terrible finish, ruined my taste buds for an hour afterward.\n",
      "Being a big fan of various Spanish lagers especially Estrella - this has impressed me very much. Great refreshing taste. bought from Aldi in a 500ml bottle.\n",
      "Hazy, juicy, sweet, tropical, candy, sour fruit, omg this is sweet, it’s if i’m drinking liquid sugary fruit juice with almonds YUK 🤮\n",
      "This lovely trampjuice, in a atomic bottle is one of the greatest drinks i ever had in my life.To create this kind of joy they probably get the apples from the best apple trees in the world. When you open this artistic bottle and smell it, it gives you that feeling that you are standing somewhere with a beautiful landscape. Drinking of this gives you also such a relaxed feeling in your head, you forget all your problems. I wouldn’t recommend this drink with a steak but more with a takeaway or ready meals. Unfortunately in my country they don’t sell this atomic bottle of pure gold, at least my uncle Riol is a frosty jacks smuggler and brings me a bottle from now and then.\n",
      "This amber fluid (cannot be called cider) tastes like flavoured water and gave me a quesy feeling in my stomach not to mention the frequent trips to the loo - both standing up and sitting down visits.\n",
      "Bonne biere blonde qui se boit bien froide, agréable par une belle soirée chaude\n",
      "Bonne noire vraiment bonne, beau col et belle couleur, comparable a la guinness. Fait partue de mon top 3 de stout\n",
      "16oz can.  Pours a hazy straw-gold with a moderate, foamy white head.  Aroma is orange, grass, some mango, and pine.  Taste is mango, pine, grass, grapefruit, light orange, and onion [maybe 5?].  Sweet.  Some bitterness.  Medium body.  Moderate carbonation.  Oily mouthfeel.\n",
      "On tap at brewery.  Pours hazy gold with a small white head.  Aroma is sugar, mango, grass, melon, and some orange.  Taste is mango and sugar with a little melon and vanilla.  Medium body.  Medium carbonation.  Thin, oily mouthfeel.  Bigger and sweeter Treat.\n",
      "They are all lying to you. There is a reason this is sold out everywhere. Easily one if the best beers ive ever had. Preffer it to Leffe blonde.\n",
      "Shit literally smells like a used condom and taste like fucking asshole. Germans like this shit cause they’re weird af. I’m in the US military and I saw two German paratroopers that I was training with drink their buddies piss.. guess there favorite beer. You fucking guessed it Heineken. I’ll go buy dos equis next time. If you like eating burnt butthole then drink this shit you nasty fucks. I literally made an account on this website to tell you how shitty this beer is, if that doesn’t tell you anything idk what will. Save yourself and never buy this beer.\n",

      "Very very good beer. Probably the most refreshing beer I’ve ever had. Lots of citrus/lemon zest but very good!\n",
      "$2 can from vintage. Piney hops nose. Haze on pale, thick frothy head. Big bitter taste, borders on IPA. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between a stronger APA and an IPA. Certainly not light and certainly is mouthcoating rather than crisp. Piney mouth-coating rude ass spruce and chewing on green grapefruit rinds, all at the same time. What-ever. Not impressed, needs to be taught some manners.\n",
      "Now this is what my home town of Dortmund stands for. The pride of my heritage.\n",
      "Best beer Ive ever tasted in my life. And that for a really good pricepoint.\n",
      "Je me demande encore si il y a eu un problème dans la chaîne de production... Son odeur est pas agréable. Elle m'a fait plus pensé à un vieux filtre à café mélangé avec l'odeur d'un entrepôt récemment lavé aux produits nettoyants à l'odeur sucré et dilué, qu'à une franche odeur de café et d’arôme bien balancé. Une expérience étrange qui me donne envie d'évité l’appellation \"stout blanc\"; la première que je banni de la sorte...\n",
      "Great beer! This years seems a little better than last years. Just the perfect blend of pow.\n",
      "Amazing beer. Such good mouth feel , and hop / yeast combo . Fantastic malt flavor , oatty.\n",
      "Refreshing beer for warm summer days, or any day here in Hawaii.  Lemon and good wheat beer come together brilliantly - wish it were available all year long. I buy all I can when I see it to stock up as much as I can. Wish distributors here brought more to our area.  Light cloudy pour with white head and refreshing citrus aftertaste.\n",
      "big black fierce eye. No real nose. Also no real head from the tap, disappointing. Taste is one big straight up ass impy stout, no doubt about it. Strong and arrogant fer sher. Rude, but in a civilized manner? Not sher. Mouth coating. Finishes like a good tuff stout.\n",
      "Poured 12oz longneck bottle into a nonic pub glass, a clear amber with weak beige head, really just a small ring of bubbles around the edge. Smelled like berry blast kool aid, tastes worse. Meaty, sticky-sweet, caramel, candied apples, lingering raspberry flavour, but in a cooked, chemically way. Heavy body, low carbonation, gross.\n",
      "Shook a pint can as instructed and poured into a pub glass, a murky to the point of opaque pink amber colour, thick head of tight bubbles, a little lace. Smelled like berliner weiss and raspberry jelly, flavour was sticky-sweet, over-the-top vanilla, creamy lactose, pepper and clove from Belgian yeast. Just so gross, in no way beer.\n",
      "Golden, clear appearance with a small head. Slightly hoppy flavour with a slight spiciness. Certainly not the run of the mill pale ale I anticipated. A new brewery for me and Country number 97.\n",
      "Pours clar yellow with pale opaque look to it. This one didn't do it for me. Texture was watery. Too sour of a finish. Too many hops combined, creating unplesant mixture.\n",
      "I can only presume the bottle I got from M&S was off. Undrinkable. Completely flat, weird taste of spirits and mould. Utterly rank.\n",
      "Very similar to 'dead pony club' in taste, style, flavour and alc vol. It's good I'm not going to lie. Very well crafted by the big boys at marstons. Excellent beer, I really enjoyed drinking\n",

      "Heel krachtige ale, makkelijk te drinken maar wel met een uitgesproken smaak. Een aanrader voor wie vrijwel geen alcohol wil drinken maar wel van een goed biertje houdt.\n",
      "Old fashioned IPA before US craft beers showed us the way.  Best of the old school beers.  Good session ale on a cold night.  Not great for a warm day.  Perfect drink in an English pub.\n",
      "Pours a chill haze looking light orange color. Thin white head with a bit of lacing. Citrus and tropical aromas. Taste is mainly grain. Bitterness is a bit harsh. There isn’t one thing NE style about this beer, well, maybe the aroma.\n",
      "Strong IBU on first 2 sips, goes down really well after that.  Great finish with nice kick.  Copper hue, smooth texture, distinctly IPA and definitely crafted.\n",
      "In fact this is not the \"Amped Up\" Lager (Alc.Vol. 4.6%), it is the Belgian Blonde Ale, so the 6% Alc.Vol. is correct\n",

      "If you have never experienced living in NM for more than 8+ years and understand her diverse culture. Then you have no say becuz NM is known for its Happy Camper and it’s rich powerful taste this IPA has. If you think it has a unbalanced taste then I suggest you excuse yourself out of this beautiful state, becuz you ain’t about the NM life. 👌🏽\n",
      "Dry just like it states.  Very drinkable, best cider I've tried.  Tastes good.  If you like dry ciders, this is a solid one.\n",
      "Anheuser-Busch, stop it. Just stop it. Stop making this watery crap that neither smells, looks, nor tastes like beer. If someone is so goddamned worried about calories and carbs then beer is not for them. Drink a diet soda for cripes sake. This is seltzer water with yellow food coloring in it. At least that is what it tastes like. What a waste of a glass bottle!\n",
      "I don't know WTF this is. Offensive taste of garbage water. Like the run off from the top of a trash can in the rain. I waited a while and had a second one just to confirm how bad it is. Can.\n",
      "Pours a murky golden color. No head at all. Aroma is yeast and grain. Taste follows with yeast and grain and has a very dry finish.\n",
      "Good beginner beer for new drinkers. Slightly bitter, good carbonation. Best when Ice Cold on a hot summer day. A light beer for sure but a good pick from the bunch. Goes down well with pretty much any food you can think of.\n",
      "A very awesome tasting cider made from locally grown apples. We drank this cider for our 1 week trip to this region. Our only regret was that we did not ship back an entire shipping container back home with us.\n",
      "Отличное пиво! Сбалансированный и очень выраженный фруктово-хмелевой аромат, невероятно приятная горечь во вкусе, красивый золотистый цвет... Всё это Hobgoblin Gold. Очень вкусно! \n",
      "Пена и пузырьки продержались не долго, но это несущественный недостаток.\n",
      "Всем рекомендую попробовать. \n",
      "Wychwood Brewery как всегда на высоте!\n",
      "Awful. A very intense taste of black current and very sour. Made me thirsty .\n",
      "The new Octoberfest is not as good as it used to be. We liked the smoothness of it now if has an extremely bitter aftertaste like and IPA so no more Sam Adams at that was the only one we always looked forward to\n",

      "Galahad ages like a fine wine, if fine wine tasted like iron filings marinaded in a sewer. The flavour profile of this hoppy badman is as exquisitely delicate as having your head kicked in by a gang of glue sniffers smacked up on horse tranquilliser. G-Had was originally synthesised by the US army during Vietnam but was immediately banned by the international community as a biological weapon of mass destruction. Today, Galahad is only manufactured by failed states as its production is a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This substance has a half life and you can feel it decaying inside you. An alien will burst from your chest 10 minutes after consumption. \n",

      "GBBF, 7th Aug 2019, on-tap. Slight haze to the light golden body, wispy white head. Not too sure why people 'bang on' about The Kernel beers, this was just a bog standard table beer with very little going on aroma or flavour wise, a few hops hanging around maybe, handy for washing my glass out though, saved me using  any water.\n",
      "On tap at beertasting Astra St Pauli, Germany. Perfection in a glass! This weissbier has everything you want and expect from a german hefeweizen. Large foamy head, sweet banana flavors, balanced hopping and a long refreshing aftertaste. Top notch!\n",
      "This is one of the few real ciders. Most are flavoured. Molsons brews the best and this is no exception. If you;re looking for real brewed cider then look no further. Some taste better but are likely fake.\n",

      "Rather Strong Beer. Have had this beer many times before. Drank two at a party once. An alright beer for those who have a strong taste for beer.\n",

      "This beer tastes like a poisonous plant exploded in my mouth. If I could rate a zero on taste I would.\n",
      "Unpleasant crude taste, almost sour. While tasting notes highlight fruitiness, it is an unfortunate mix of lemon overpowered by tangy lime. Not a fan of this one!\n",
      "This is an excellent budget larger if you want to have a couple nice beers but not have to spend top dollar for. Don't expect it to have the same amount of depth of flavours as high end larger tho.\n",
      "Really nice easy lager, when I was 18 it was a very good beer, the women were cold but the beer was gold! Now I am 45 I lament on this old dear! The modern Coors Extra is rubbish and the pub has had become a Islamic furbish when I was 45 and the Masjid is a dive!\n",
      "Vom Fass im BrewDog/DogTap Berlin 2019-08 getrunken. Bei diesen hellgoldenen Aofel-Cider muß man sich fragen wo die Äpfel im Herstellungsprozeß verwendet wurden. Im Aroma findet man nun ganz schwach Apfelnoten. Dies Säure ist auch ganz schwach wie auch der Körper. Das Ding hier erinnert eher an eine schlechte, stark verdünnte Apfelschorle. Hat zwar keine Fehlnoten aber auch kaum Apfel. Nein so was brauche ich nicht.\n",
      "Vom Fass im BrewDog/DogTap Berlin 2019-08 getrunken. Die hellrote Farbe von dem Cider leuchtet sicher auch im Dunkeln ;-). In Nase wirkt das Aroma irgendwie künstlich. Am Gaumen ist dieses Beeren Cider dann aber nur noch ein dünner Beeren-Frucht-Extrakt ohne Körpern, so daß es eher wie Bonbon-Wasser schmeckt. Entäuschend und kommt mir nie mehr ins Glas.\n",

      "Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Delirium Red is a Belgian ale with cherry and elderberries crafted by Brouwerij Huyghe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragrance of elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is purple that pours a low pinkish white head. When held up to light, the beer glows maroon and reveals sediment. The alcohol content is 8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elderberries are juicy and textures the mouthfeel. Cherries compliments the elderberries while moderately tarting the complexion. Belgian yeast softens the body and draws out the figs used. Biscuit malt blends and flavors the yeasty profile. Plums are easily distinguished during the finish as an almond touch fluoresces the finish. Black licorice spices the take and bitters the comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delirium Red is an enticing Belgian ale. The elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt, and figs make this Belgian a one of a kind. This is a sweet beer. However, the Belgian yeast and almonds tones it down, yet the elderberries and cherries still perpetuate. The plum and almond finish is my favorite aspect to this beer. I loved drinking this libation and enraptured by its complexity. I highly recommend trying it. Cold, you will face the sweetness head on. In my opinion, serving it between cold and room temperature is optimal. Be careful as you pour to leave behind sediment.\n",

      "750 mL bottle.  Hazy golden and a little hazy.  Smells of peach, honey, and whiskey.  Faint whisps of acetone.  Tastes of peach, whiskey, white wine, and strong sourness.  All of those things mask acetone which doesn't show up until the back end.  When it does, though, it hits hard.  Honey and oak linger with the acetone.  Tough to drink.  The flavors up front are nice, but the back end renders it undrinkable.\n",
      "Keg at Brewdog Södermalm, Stockholm.  Black, small head. Aroma of caramel. Super sweet with full body and rounded mouthfeel. Aggressive caramel, sugar and butter Revolting sweetness. Ouch.\n",
      "Bottle. Wine Rack, Sharrow, Sheffield. 6.1%. Mostly clear, pale, amber gold. Fine, dense white head stays the course. Nose has wood glue. Raw meat. And that’s about it. Holy shit. Taste is flabby, fatty bitterness. I’ve no idea what is going on here. Oily and soggy mouthfeel. Can’t be bothered going on. Awful. \n",

      "500ml (4%) shared with mother at home on 10 Aug 2019, from Morrisons, Castlehill Road, Ayr (purchased 10 Aug 2019; bb 1 May 2021):  parma violets aroma, lovely purple colour, floral, raspberry, faint violet, refreshing, very sweet.\n",
      "Exceptional lite beer. It has no off-putting taste, no off-putting odor, is relatively low carb and it is 6% abv. To top it off it's dirt cheap. In my opinion, for what it is, it is perfect. It's the classiest low calorie swill a man can drink. I honestly prefer the flavor to every other cheap canned beer. I love a good craft beer, but I'm a man with a broad spectrum of tastes. When you're on a budget and you want a nice buzz without the excess calories(besides the calories in the alcohol it's self), Bud Light Platinum is the best option that I know of in terms of taste and bang for buck.\n",
      "Darught @BerlinBar. Unclear golden with a white head. Grainy aroma with toffee and some hoppy citrus notes. Flavour is sweet and perfume notes go the nose, while drinking it. It has some artificial flavour of chemicals. Soap or some cleaning detergent. Some bitterness - quite decent. Really not my cup of beer overall though.\n",
      "355ml can. amber pour with creamy white head. Aroma is sweet with exaggerated citrus fruit character. flavor is sweet with doughy malt, sugary and pretty forgettable.\n",
      "After spending 5 months on assignment in North Africa I find myself longing for another. The beer itself is the equivalent of Bud Light however in the same was a Bud light reminds you of college Flag Speciale reminds me off the Sahara and sweating through every piece of clothing I own. All in all i wish they sold it in the states.\n",

      "Come on, if I want to be really bitter, I need an alky level to match. At 7.5% I'm not expecting much kick in this $3 can from vintage. Seems to have a lot of foam head for a double. Smell is mild hint of volatile hop perfume. The odor carries across the room after you pop the can. Milkshake style visually. Big bitter strong hit but not that if a double viscous IPA. Yes, even has some cutting co2 present on the palate for a change, quite odd for an IPA. Probably comes across more like a stronger bubbly APA. Perhaps should be put back in the NEIPA category. JMHO. If this is a double or imperial IPA, I'd say its one of the better ones I've done, and that aint a good thing for IPA lovers, heheheh. Finishes a little rubbery or veggie-like, somewhat like the bitterness of an over hopped  session IPA.\n",
      "This concoction is by far the worst thing I've ever drank. First of all, the aroma aka, THE WET DOG SMELL is disgusting. And who's brilliant idea was it to make a wheat beer with added notes of CARAMEL AND LEMON. Why?\n",
      "Pours clear amber with a thin white head. Aroma of sickly sweet artificial cherry. Taste has acerbic cider notes, artificial sweetness. Palate is dry and apple-y. Pretty bad.\n",

Aroma is lightly malty (grain), lightly hoppy (orange), with notes of rotten onions / compost bucket, butter, sweatsocks, dirty dish rag, ammonia. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, light to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean. Medium body, watery/silty texture, soft carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.\n",

      "A nice smooth crisp beer. Golden color with a very pleasant aroma. Great beer on a hot summer day very refreshing.\n",
      "Skinny 11oz can (just another way to suck money from you) reminiscent of an energy drink.  Nose too-sweet coffee and cream, sugar, and malted milt balls.  Pour creamy as any coffee drink, opaque pale mud, color actually very close to the lighter brown on the label of the can, with no head.  Very sweet in the mouth but not cloying, does have an artificially-boosted character, sort of a stevia instead of cream addition; essentially chocolate milk with a wisp of low-grade robusta and a melted Whopper.  Body extremely thin and watery, no bitterness, hint of drying out and even astringency, no alcohol, hint of flimsy dirt.  Really no stout/beer character here to speak of, this is the equivalent of a cash-grab Frappuccino for brand loyalists only.  [2019.08.06: 1.1]\n",
      "Ok, this can says pineapple and I'm initially thinking NO, not another weird fruity beer. But now I see its listed as just another IPA, HAH, almost as bad, heheh. Smells like a fruity volatile beery drink with a tad of some IPA olfactory. Chunks in the bottom of the can spill into the mug. Fairly pale and quite hazy but not like a NEiPA. Terrible big rude ass taste. During the session it truely tries to impress with guts big straight up biting bitter ass. In the end, its just another ubiquitous one in a million IPA, what-ever. Yes terribly trashy and a single testicle. Thundercunt I say! Approaches bouble IPA territory.; such an  idiot and twat. Go for it Mr double set of twatlips. You love it, drink it down, twatwaffle.

Refreshing, fruity, clean, crushable.\n",

      "Visually, it pours beautifully, with a picture postcard head that lasts and lasts... and lasts... and... and... how odd.  The flavour is weakly watery, weakly bready, but somehow also highly unpleasant. I had a few sips and chucked it. This stuff is disgusting and unworthy of a serious review. I'm very surprised that the brewer of some of my all-time favourite beers is putting its name on this.\n",
      "Can: Poured a light black color ale with a brown foamy head with limited retention and no lacing. Aroma of sour notes with some strong hazelnut syrup notes and lactose. Taste is a mess between some strong sour notes and sweet syrupy hazelnut notes with some lactose. Body is light with good carbonation. Awful mix of flavours.\n",
      "The worst beer in the world? I think not! I really like how the head dissipates quickly. Also, I must mention that it has an extremely clean taste.\n",
      "One of the few wheat beers you can find in Canada. Super close to European kinds of beer. Far way better than trendy IPAs\n",

      "Perfectly refreshing and delicate.\n",
      "Draught at Tunes in The Dunes, Perranporth - served from Jubel Landrover Bar. Light and crisp lager with subtle floral taste - very good!\n",
      "Purchased on tap at The Approach Tavern in Mile End. I can’t say I have come across beer with Elderflower before, but this was delicious. A crisp lager with subtle elderflower notes. Dangerously refreshing!\n",
      "Purchased on tap at The Queen’s Head in Holborn and was sceptical at first as I’m not a big fan of the Belgium fruit beers I have previously tried. However, this beer was light and crisp like a lager, but also had the refreshment of a fruit cider without the overpowering sweetness! I’ll definitely be back for more\n",
      "Draught pint from Bristol Beach Club. A very light refreshing beer with subtle peach flavour.\n",
      "Lovely beer, crisp and refreshing, bought it because it was recommended in The Times, and can see why, definitely worth a try.\n",
      "Pale in colour, floral and grape like aromas, quite dry and crisp on the mouth, finishes slightly sweet. Great refreshing lager.\n",

      "Off the Rail Paranoid IPA\n",
      "Excellent well balanced taste. It was a Great tasting IPA that did not come up to your throat unlike other IPA's. You can actually drink this all night and would not feel the overfilling overhoppy overtrying to much critic conscious beer.

      "Bardzo ładny czerwono - miedziany kolor. Trunek klarowny, przejrzysty, fajnie pracuje. Piana obfita, średnio trwała, gęsta. Aromat mocno chmielowy oraz cytrusowy. Cytryna, grejpfrut oraz limonka. W smaku trochę słodkie, intensywna goryczka, finish trochę żywiczny. Orzeźwiające, rześkie, dobrze pijalne, średnio wysycone. Dobra IPA, bez szału, ale wciąż lepiej niż gorzej.\n",
      "On tap at Horse and Cow. Awesome taste! Smooth & crisp citrus flavor with a soft fruity aroma and subtle hop to finish!\n",

      "Had an Extra Cold Heineken at Schipol airport in Amsterdam. My god this beer tastes so much better in The Netherlands, I’m from Norway and bottled here it just doesnt taste the same. Was one of the best experiences I’ve had at an airport i was tired of traveling and a nice cold beer was the perfect thing. Was the best lager I’ve had on tap to date.\n",
      "Unfortunately, dark beer, light bitterness, far from the porter with character, Can carry a bag with golf clubs porter Żywiec\n",
      "Utterly disgusting!!!! Tastes like a dodgy pint through lines that haven't been cleaned EVER..... Then with half a bottle of vinegar chucked in for good measure. Worst beer I have ever drank, avoid this stuff like the plague!!!!!!\n",
      "Lime-A-Rita has a fizzing-away head, a hazy, yellow-gray appearance, and some bubbles. The aroma is of pale malt and spicy fruit or margarita mix. Flavor is similar. This is very sweet, and Lime-A-Rita finishes medium sweet. RJT\n",
      "Love a few demi-pêche when in the Alps so knew I had to try this one. Pours light-golden with a good head. Strong peach aromas on the nose, light and citrus, very refreshing and not overly sweet so drinkable. Great stuff.\n",
      "Tastes like straight up low tide. I liked their lost tropic cider but this one is seriously one to avoid.\n",
      "Pounder: Orange peel nose with significant DMS. Cloudy amber, medium head.  Orange peel, grass, DMS.Full body, moderate carbonation.\n",

      "Was a draft from Waxy O'Connor's. I would not get this again.\n",
      "Just simply lovely ! The best 0.5 beer yet ( if you like citrus pale ale ) if not then you wont like it ! .the greatest thing next to the taste is is the texture and you get a head on it so it tastes , smells and looks like full alcahol beer  ! All of this with no hangover and you can drink it anytime any place 🤗🤗🤗 thank you Adnams .\n",
      "Big pounder can from vintage for $3. Big blue sea colored can with yeller writing. Slight haze on pale in mug, with an interesting head. Smell is old rubber, maybe tuna? Just asking. Yes, rubbery and odd, wants to kick like a real IPA but just barely gets there. Veggie, did I say veggie? Oh yea, you know, that typical veggie cabbage taste thing going on. Straight up symplocarpus foetidus finish. There, you have it.\n",

      "De Labirratorium. En vaso de pinta inglesa de Ikea. Jugando a Oozi Earth Adventure. No puedo pensar en mejor forma de hacer una ipa inglesa. Lupulo fresco de caracter vegetal con notas terrosas y minerales. Ultrabebible y con retrogusto larguisimo\n",
      "From a $3 can from vintage, its clear gold of course. Smell is sweeter perfume hop flora. Taste is ubiquitous IPA. A plethora of nasty arrogant bitter preservative happy BS. Any alky content is amplified by the butyl rubber mouth coating effects of this brew. CARNAGE, CARP, CASH-STRAPPED, CASTIGATE, CASTRATED. Such a CATACLYSMIC, CATASTROPHE and a CAUSTIC CHAGRIN. All ends up being just a CHALLENGING & CHAOTIC, CHASTEN IPA CAPRICE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours clear gold with a full snow-white head. Faint orange zest aroma. Watery orange taste. Not much body, and no aftertaste. Thin and insipid.\n",
      "Burk från SB. Lilablå lätt disig vätska med litet ljus smutsvitt skum. Doftar lätt bärigt samt lite toner av diskmedel. Tunn smak som spretar mellan ipa, något konstigt sött samt en liten bärighet. Odrickbart skräp.\n",
      "Initial hit of peach transitions into a light, malty lager which is surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink without being too sweet. Well-balanced beer that I will definitely be buying again.\n",
      "Light-gold colour, thin head, strong peach aroma and well integrated peach taste with lager undertones. Very well balanced and easy-drinking summer craft beer\n",
      "Bud Light Lemon Tea has a thick, white head, a clear, golden appearance, with some bits of glass lacing. The aroma is of spice candles, wax, herbal potpourri, and lemon, with some pale malt. The flavor is similar, with a medium body. Bud Light Lemon Tea finishes mostly dry. They did a great job with it, although it's not light. RJT\n",

      "Love this beer. Been drinking it since it was in skinny cans. Great calorie to alcohol ratio. Its my goldilocks. Budweiser boats me and bud light is well bud light. Select is just right\n",
      "Pours a golden color with a decent white frothy head. Smells of vinegar and musty spice cabinet. Unpleasant taste of white vinegar, dill, and musty red pepper flakes. Overall a yucky \"pickle beer\" that would have been kind of funny and enjoyable if it came in a 50ml \"shooter\" so you could say you've tasted it, and then moved on with your life, but it's definitely a challenge to finish a 12oz can, and I really have no idea what to do with the other 3 beers from the 4 pack (maybe give them as \"gag gifts\" to people I don't like?). Marz should just stick to the Double IPA style that they do so well with.\n",
      "Why does everything have to be bastardized by IPA? Its all one style but with 32 shades and the same connotation as the book. Isn't 32 different kind of IPA enough? Come now. Clear pale from $2 can. Little head. Smell is rude ass dull IPA viscous perfume. Taste is as expected, IPA laced beer. Does have shades of a difficult domestic bitter astringent pils. Not many manners here but fer sher I thot it would be a little more impressive. Pretty good co2 but not enough to distract from the up front hops.\n",
      "It is one of my favourite German beers, I like the taste and the foam it produces when in beercup.\n",
      "Ok, got this pounder can from vintage for $3 but it doesn't say arrogant on it. Olfactory of mild hops. You would think if it was arrogant, it would be big alky content. Its not and you would think it would tuff on the taste buds, well it is. Yes, it has a rubbery feel to it like so makny mild veggie IPA, perhaps more like a session IPA, heheh. Well, anyway, except for that stupid ass IPA effect,  it does have the piercing typical bite of a pils to it. Well, tho not of the real pils, like that of the old country pils, but certainly like the straight up domestic varieties that say they a wannah bee real old country civilized pils but really isn't. What else can be said? Except that this beer does not rise to the occasion of a real arrogant stone beer. However, its really not a pils and its more like an india pale lager, HAH!\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon my first sip of doble Malta, I frantically called the bar tender over in panic, as i was certain he mistakenly poured me liquid diamonds, or the tears of a unicorn. I had no idea how I was going to pay for such a heavenly potion. With my head down In shame and sorrow, I asked how much it was and with a wink of the eye, he said, only €3.90 for 6!!! Bargain! \n",

      "Is there really no indication of the alcohol content in this beer? Completely didn't realize it was 8.1% and unknowingly consumed more than I should have, thinking it was a standard beer. Shame on them for not labeling their beers properly. Aside from that it is a a pretty smooth tripel with a mediocre taste.\n",
      "Can. Pink body with traces of a white head. Nose of earthy tropical fruit and dough. Notes of the cucumber are present. The taste is strange with floral notes and odd cucumber. There is a light finish of what reminds me of chlorinated pool water. Absolutely no tart character that I would expect from the style. Overall this is hard to drink. A complete disaster across the board on this one. Drain pour.\n",
      "Do not buy this drink. It tastes like a you wiped out on the beach and salt water rushed up your nose. The name is very accurate but the drink is painfully bad.\n",
      "This IPA poured a  clear yellow colour with a creamy, white head. Nice lacing. Scents include pineapple,lemon citrus, white bread and sweet jam. First swig was a little thin with a blistering amount of hops. Very little of anything but citrus hops. Finish isn’t the most bitter I’ve had but too hoppy for this guy.\n",

      "Aus der Flasche im 2014-08 getrunken. Kaum war es im Glas und schon ging ein Stöhnen \"Kuhstall\" um den Tisch. \"Nee wirklich!\" nach dem der Schaum sich gesetzt hatte ging auch dieses Kuhstallaroma weg. Am Ende ist es zwar ein guter Durstlöscher an heißen Tagen dank seiner trockene Bitterkeit am Ende. Dieses Farmhouse Ale gehört eher zu den spannenden Bieren, die mal mal trinken kann aber nicht muß.\n",
      "smooth and clean, very easy drinking pilsener.  Perfect session beer that leads to one after another\n",
      "Bottle, $2 at vintage.  Scary volatile aroma. Pours like one big ball of viscous bitter rubber and it taste exactly the same. What's the purpose of this beer, just to get you f'd up on one bottle and insult you the whole time while its doing so? WTF?!? How can anybody enjoy bullshit like this? One big fat nasty mug of happy bullshit. Warming sensations all around in the finish.\n",
      "Had at the Black Horse in North Nibley.\n",
      "Biscuit flavours. Citrusy with an afternote of Elderflower. \n",
      "Personally Ioved it.\n",
      "Light yellow appearance with a frothy head.\n",
      "Smell of manure and a bitter taste. A note of too old sausages and cold meat.\n",
      "Weird stuff.\n",
      "This beer is a total disgrace to every drink which calls itself a beer. \n",
      "The first sip is the worst. I looked three times if I got the wrong beer but after finding out that this should represent Bavarian lager beer/Helles I was outraged. The best taste experience you can get with this beer is as soon as you don’t have to taste it any longer. It’s a completely scam and an offense to German brewery culture. I have tasted a lot of beers all around the globe but this one is by far the worst. It tastes like maltbeer mixed with molten rubber and a sweet taste of cheap metal. Gordon Ramsey would knock out the chef brewer himself. \n",
      "I read quite a lot of reviews and everyone who considers this beer as „quite tasteful“ or „süffig“ has obviously never tasted any other beer. Ever. \n",
      "This beer is that bad that I wouldn’t drown my deepest enemy with it. \n",
      "It’s simply shocking that this liquid wasn’t banned by German TÜV or the health ministry. \n",
      "I usually don’t write reviews but this beer tasted so disgusting that I had to distract myself.\n",
      "on the terrace of Café Extrablatt\n",
      "are there still beers on the menu that I have not yet tasted; 1 piece\n",
      "very dry and yet a soft, chapped malt feeling, not the first choice to do\n",
      "Bottle bought at Kvickly Helsingør, Denmark. How bad can a beer be? This was terrible and undrinkable. After a few unpleasant zips the brew went down the drain. Never again.\n",
      "Purchased a 19.2 fluid ounce can from my local Stater Brothers. Off-white head on top of a clear yellow golden body. It smells of Pine and Woodland hops actually. The Taste is clean and refreshing, with hints of bread notes. Seems like it went flat rather fast, but other than that it's a very good beer\n",
      "Decent brew I'm glad a buddy sent me a surly pack. The new had a decent color mild head and a good finish. An average brew\n",
      "This beer reminds me of shiner which is never a let down maybe a little cleaner.  The best part is my beautiful wife loves it and there’s nothing better than having a drink with your best friend\n",
      "\n",
      "I found this uneven with bite through the swallow I may have found my least favorite IPA\n",
      "\"Brewed and bottled (and seen a man about a dog at Lagunitas).\" This pathetic attempt at grasping at whatever was left of the north-of-England roots (which, going by the taste and aroma is absolutely nothing) is the slogan that now aptly befits this swill. \n",
      "\n",
      "To me, Newcastle always stood out as accessible, yet quality brown ale. Low on hops, mellow -- just want you'd expect. I was suspicious when I tried  the Holland brew but found it pretty much the same as the old english one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no idea that they were now producing it in the US and had completely changed the formula. There's some quality accessible US-made ale out there, like Bass ale, but this tasteless, bitter stuff that's in front of me right now is a failure on every corner. And a shame, too. Goes to show how little tradition and consistent commitment to quality matter these days and how blind corporate greed corrupts everything it touches, parasitically, destroying even itself in the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "Never again.\n",
      "I love the flavor of this beer.  I wish it was carried in restaurants and other establishments. Much better flavor.\n",
      "12 oz bottle from vintage. My label however, does not have the word mofo on it. I guess some politically correct bastard thought it politically incorrect and removed it before the labels went to print, heheh. Slightly below room temperature this stuff smells like mild laid back hops with a citrus tinge. Head is real big, almost all the glass. I almost spilled it over with just a few ounces. Slightly hazy pale yellow orange. Pretty good sizzle on the palate, co2 is doing its job. Can't really taste the mango in it, its mostly typical ubiquitous bitter IPA. Like IPA? As if you don't already know a million of them? Here, you go then, add this one to your list. Aftertaste is weird alky - dull fruit, if that's what you want to call it; perhaps that's where the mango comes kicking in, who knows? Terribly on style, almost astringent at times. This lager lover is not impressed, so it must be good IPA, HAH.\n",

      "4oz pour at OH, Rochester. Pour was an inky black. Smell was straight maple syrup. Taste was like drinking waffles smothered in syrup. Insanely sweet. Gross. Couldn’t finish even 2oz. No.\n",
      "Absolutely disgusting! The beer & the company! This company is racist! I will never buy anything from this company ever again!\n",
      "Can from Total Wine in Sunnyvale, CA. Aroma is lavender soap, some berry. Taste is dish soap in a sour beer. Almost made it through 6 sips. Drain pour.\n",
      "Bought thousands of 6 packs of Newcastle over the years. I took a 6 month break and find it is now a regular old beer. Nothing distinctive about the taste at all. Somewhat tangy. Just an average IPA. I just don't know what sets this apart from 50 other beers. Shame on whoever made this decision.\n",
      "Very thin mouthfeel and lighter side of color for the category. Good aroma but taste is lacking. The biggest issue with taste is the carbonation being soda-like and causing bitterness. Seems to be a common problem among lower quality stouts from micro-brewers who don't primarily brew stouts. This is a huge problem for this category that is not hard to change but would make a huge difference. If you're listening, please don't skimp on using nitro to save on costs. I understand the business aspect but the cost to reputation is much higher. Though IPAs are all the rage now, stouts may later become a trend just as big. And for good reason. But that reason for becoming a stout fan is the thick creamy smooth and very aromatic flavor and smell of a well-aged barrel nitro imperial russian stout. Not this thin concoction meant to keep the price range equivalent to an IPA or ale. I will note that Rock bottom which is also small does a good job with their After Midnight imperial stout.\n",
      "I love Pils. I've tried hundreds of different brands, but this is the best for me. Hits all the right spots. And then consider the price! 10/10.\n",
      "Traditional strong British ale. Really hot day today probably the hottest of the year, 32°C and I'm loving this. Sweet tasting, malty, hoppy. Very refreshing. Toffee, nettle, tobacco, Fruity. Delicious. I wish I could give it more than 5\n",
      "July 2019 Can from Cloud Wine, Southampton for less than £1. Ooh, this is more interesting than I expected. Kinda roasty woody notes to start, firm oily body, some petrol fumes, kinda Belgian, odd. Hmmm. There's a lot of flavour here - not quite sure it's all the sort of flavour I want. This may be one of those beers that really is best drunk cold. Very cold. The flavours are building up in my mouth kinda like petrol fumes. Spicy, phenolic, smoke, bandaid, TCP, plastic, peanut skin, raw potato. Gawd! I think I've had enough now. The interesting is starting to turn into unpleasant and difficult to drink much more. Yes. Enough. Stop. This is the sort of beer that drunk cold in small samples would remain interesting and intriguing, but drunk as a proper drinking beer - a full can at room temperature, it becomes a chore to the point of torture.\n",
      "Very disappointing.  Too malty for my expectation of a double IPA. Taste was chocolate malt a little coffee more like a porter. No significant Hop presence. Pourd dark Amber head disappeared fairly quickly but did have a little lacing.  Carbonation just okay. It's drinkable but that's it. Won't get again\n",
      "Given this beer as a gift from guests staying with us from Weston super Mare's twin town of Hildesheim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, really impressed with the taste of this excellent brown ale.\n",
      "Looks like a typical hazy IPA. Smooth foamy head. Perhaps a little orange in the nose. Big strong thicker near gagging first swig impressions, quite volatile and bitter. Ruthless rudimentary ruckus. Big strong example of another ubiquitous well made IPA, just put em all in the same category, must be a gozzilion of them. Big bitter blastoff. Nasty negative nullifying experience. Terribly on style. The strenght of the hops almost covers any tangerine you may be lookin' fer.\n",
      "Pours a fairly clear amber with little to no head. Aromas of nothing, faint passionfruit and orange, followed by nothing. Taste is for a brief moment passionfruit and orange, followed by nothing. Little to no hoppy bitterness and has the mouthfeel of sparkling water. Overall, slightly flavoured water - not a good session IPA.\n",
      "You guys are HORRIBLE..Everyone PLEASE READ PEOPLE. COM! SEE HOW THIS COMPANY TREATS CUSTOMERS!  PLEASE DON'T SPEND ONE CENT! VERY VERY RUDE!! WOULD HAVE LOVED TO RATE YOU AT ALL ZEROS BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS PUBLIC IT MADE ME AT LEASE GIVE U AN 1 WHICH IS WAY MORE THAN YOU DESERVE!\n",
      "Here's the simple reason why this brew gets a bad rap in USA - most beer drinkers here are not accustomed to a what is really a normal (unfiltered by law) alcohol content of a \"malt liquor\", which is a marketing made up term for BEER that usually signifies something cheap and high in BAC content (St.Ides, Old English, Colt45, etc.)\n",
      "It is actually a very decent brew that offers one an opportunity to enjoy how real beer is made before state/federal regulations get to it and water down the flavor.\n",
      "And to the idiot (lehers) that thinks that it tastes like coors light but with more alcohol - I strongly suggest you not only seek professional help to check your taste buds, but also stop drinking beer altogether.  You are wasting too much of your money and beer that others can actually enjoy.\n",
      "This beer is great on a hot summer day. I wouldn't even think about drinking it in cooler weather, it's definitely a summer beer. The strawberry flavor is natural and not overpowering. It does NOT taste like Kool-Aid, like some orange-flavored beers. It's very refreshing and goes down smooth. I got a real craving for this beer while working in the yard on a very hot day. Can't find it anywhere. So, any beer that can bring on a craving has to be pretty good.\n",

Got a stuffy nose so don't smell much there, nothing apparent, rather neutral. First taste is bitter thicker liquid with a resinous friutly butyl blast. Bampot, bastard, beaner. Real bitchass, bitchtits bollocks; what else can be said. Arrogant mah-fah? Just asking! Terribly & nastily on double imperial style. Not impressed, heheheh.\n",
      "Organic. Bottle. Very refreshing. Good clean taste. Tastes pure. Good flavor but very light; I would prefer to have higher alcohol content.   Overall an excellent organic beer, but hard to get drunk with it! \n",

      "Fint humlet efter europæisk forbillede, med smag af bitterhumlen. Ikke en typisk humletype.\n",
      "Great pineapple flavor, very light and crisp. Not overly sugary or sweet, and no bitter aftertaste like some hard ciders. I have drank a good bit of ciders and this is easily one of the best i’ve had. Even better on draft, but damn good in a bottle or can as well.\n",
      "Pours very smooth and clean. Golden caramel color with a creamy white head. First smell impression was of honey and banana. Very smooth taste.\n",
      "The flatest \"beer\" I ever had the questionable privilege of drinking. \n",
      "No clue what they little \"pressurized container\" inside tye can is for but the beer is 100% flat. All it's got is a nice looking head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tastes like you poured it at noon and left it standing until 20:00. I.am sure it could have some nice taste but as flat as it is therr is just no way for any flavor to develop.\n",
      "This is an underrated beer. It is excellently made but drunk at far too low a temperature as generally with beer. The low temp hinders the nose and the taste as does guzzling - yeah, I used the word. The surprise was the taste of toffee from such a lightly flavored beer. The web site lists caramel malt which explains the toffee flavor. The nose was clean - no off aromas -with cereal and toffee. 12 oz can   BBY 11/4/19\n",
      "A big 20 oz can, I never saw a can like this before, its almost a crowler, but aint.  It has a cool orange muscle car on the the label, I suspect its a chevy or even an olds from the 60's. Just $2 at chalet in boardman, nice place. I suspect its actually hazy pale from the previous raters. I drank this right out of the can from a really cold fridge. Very mellow for an ale. Pretty good carbonation. Man, this can is so big, bigger than a pounder fer sher. Sesquipedalian is long,a nd so is this can! How about this, they put a phone number on this can for you to call them: 707-769-4495.  I think I'll give it a f=try and see if somebody actually icks up, that would be halarious.\n",

      "Very pleasant with foamy and fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly warms the stomach. Crisp. Fair amount of bitter hop flavor upon the moment it passes your lips with a slightly stronger bitter hop after taste.\n",
      "Horrible! Chilling with in law decide to give this a shot. First taste you get strong rubbing alcohol taste followed by sweet vanilla then bitter chocolate.\n",

      "Quite honestly, it's a waste of time to discuss aroma, appearance, and mouthfeel when a beer tastes like the brewer dumped the contents of several ashtrays and a re-cycling dumpster of rotted, wet corrugated cardboard into the copper for the boiling. I wanted to like it ... really. Ooh, an exotic dark porter. But halfway through a 12oz can I knew something was seriously wrong with this brew. I guess you might fool yourself into believing it's graham crackers, but two days later my skin is still oozing the smell of cigarettes and cardboard boxes ... and I don't smoke or shop at Costco.\n",
      "They tried to make as they a beer between helles and pilsner... I don't know it doesn't remind me anything tbh\n",
      "Very dominant yeasty taste and aroma. Could not finish. Would be good for making bread.\n",
      "Excellent taste and pleasant, heavy mouth feel. Slight sour note accompanies clean watermelon flavor.\n",
      "Bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.\n",
      "Body is medium yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma is lightly malty (grain, husks), lightly hoppy (herbs), with light notes of rotting vegetables (yellow squash, etc.), concrete, dirty dishrag, bubble gum, alcohol, apple juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.\n",
      "Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, very unclean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium to full body, syrupy/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma is fairly meek, and composed almost entirely of off notes...if it was only stronger, it might score a 1 for aroma. Very dirty aftertaste as well, unsurprisingly. Honestly the only nice thing about it is the lasting head...everything else is just plain repulsive.\n",
      "Subtil goût de miel bien agréable en bouche, bonne amertume typique d'une Boréal\n",
      "After spending way too much money trying different craft beers, which most are not worth the money spent.   Good to go back to the basics.  There is nothing special about this beer other than the price.  I like this beer, the flavor, and how I can drink a almost a 12 pack and still be functional.\n",
      "Bottled.  Dark brown, mid sized head. Rich aroma of brown sugar. Super sweet with medium to full body and rounded mouthfeel. Syrup and ripe fruit,some tobacco. Lots of brown sugar. Lost in a sea of syrup.\n",
      "Grabbed a couple of crowlers from the taproom, nice hazy NE IPA not to juicy. Lots of hops nice taste and finish.\n",
      "Pink with a ton of junk floating around in it.  Got this 25 ounce can at a gas station just because I had not seen it before and figured I'd give it a try.  While pouring into glass I noticed chunk coming out with the brew.  Chunks coming out does not make me want to drink it.  The smell was off setting too.  Was expecting mango since that is what the can said was in it but, just tomato's and pepper.  Smells more like a salsa than anything else.  If it was called salsa beer then I would have been ready for that.  After reading the can I then discovered that this Clamato, is that clam and tomato? yuck!  Oh and picante is in it.  There is where the salsa smell is from.  Now that I know more about what all is in this it is going straight down the sink.  No way I'm going to drink this mess and be up all night with stomach issues.\n",
      "The perfect lunch/dinner beer. A clear, honey-golden colour. Very light and inviting. A tiny taste of citrus, very mild. Goes down very smoothly.\n",
      "In all honesty, the taste is close to none existing, which is why I'd recommend this as a lunch/dinner beer - it's not impressive on it's own, but have a meat and salad meal and all of a sudden the taste of both the meal and the beverage multiplies in both intensity and enjoyment. \n",
      "Sweet in typical German fashion. This would be a perfect beer for German airlines to offer during flights (yes, that is a compliment).\n",
      "All in all, this is the gentlest of gentle beers. Drink it outdoors during summer with a favourite food, that's it proper use it seems.\n",
      "18-07-2019; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bière, as part of their February 2019 discovery box).\n",
      "The looks of the beer are alright. Golden yellow colour, clear beer and very rough white head. Foam retention is almost non-existent. It looks a bit watery. It also ain't bubbling a lot. \n",
      "The aroma of the beer is soo-soo. Some simple rough malts that are a bit bready and some dry hop aromas. Grassy, piney and a bit zesty and fruity. But, not too strong. It all is a bit like a malt lemonade with some hop aromas dropped into it. It misses some of the soul of a beer.\n",
      "The taste of the beer is okay. Bitter hops, sweet malts. Thats it. A bit rough and definitely simple. Not to unbalanced. But I expected a bit more. \n",
      "The palate of the beer is weak. Thin texture, light body and light carbonation. The finish is watery and short. It has some malts and some bitter hops. All in all, there are some essences of a Pale Ale in this beer. But, it misses soul, balance and yeast and alcohol. When do people start to realise beer just can't be made without alcohol. The yeast and alcohol are important parts of the aroma bouquet of a beer. It is the most important aspect of many beers. This is just a hop flavoured lemonade; nothing more, nothing less.\n",
      "Had this beer for the first time, while on vacation, loved it bought home a case which quickly disappeared.....have to get more!\n",

      "Not sure why beers like this get so much hate. Rate within the style. As for a light beer it’s great. Higher abv than all the rest at 6. Taste is above average with some grass and corn coming through. Good outdoor beer to unwind with. Nothing groundbreaking, but one of the best in the style.\n",
      "No foaminess or head. Thin mouthfeel with bitterfinish and soda like carbonation that is physically visible. Light color for imperial stout. Peanut butter aroma is almost non existent compared to belching beaver’s creamy peanut butter aroma. Cost $10.20.\n",
      "Bitter light taste. My friend Howett Helped me drink a 1/4 of a medium sized Keg at Daigneaultpallooza. Other than what i said, Meh...\n",

      "This is the worst beer I have ever tasted this coming from a true alcoholic. I drank two from a 12 dollars six pack and threw the rest away.\n",
      "One of the best. It has huge amount of different flavours. It's not for reducing thirst. It's just for pure enjoeyement.\n",
      "Probably the best Red I have found in a bottle/can.  A great price @ trader joes currently at about $6.00 per 6pack.\n",
      "Die Biere von Hacker-Pschorr werden bereits seit 1998 bei Paulaner produziert.\n",
      "Hab ich in den letzten 4 Jahren mehrfach verkostet und war das schlechteste Weissbier, das ich jemals verkostet habe (und ich habe über 100 bewertet). Hab ich noch nie erlebt, aber meine Körperchemie war nicht mit diesem Bier kompatibel. Konnte es einfach nicht glauben. Bei 4 von 6 Verkostungen waren ein tauber Mund (selbst die Lippen) und ein rauer Hals die Folge. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich mich gerade vergiftet habe. Irre. Ich kann es nicht erklären, da dies nur bei diesem Bier jemals der Fall war.\n",
      "Bei der aktuellen Verkostung (Sommer 2019) passierte dies nicht und ich erlaube mir deshalb eine möglichst objektive (wenn auch nicht positive) Bewertung. \n",
      "Sehr viel Hefe, die da durchs Glas wabert. Find ich gut. Süß, malziger Geruch, nicht sehr lecker. Auch geschmacklich ist dies vorherrschend. Nicht sehr süffig. Wird ab dem Mittelteil dann sogar gallig / bitter, sehr unangenehm trocken, kratzig und dumpf. Bäh. Dass das harte Münchner Wasser in Verbindung mit viel Hopfen ein \"kratziges\" Mundgefühl erzeugt, ist ein Problem, dass seit Jahrhunderten bekannt ist - und das andere Brauereien aus der \"Hauptstadt mit Herz\" trotzdem irgendwie besser gebacken bekommen. Schade, dass das normale dunkle Weizen von Hacker-Pschorr inzwischen offenbar eingestellt wurde und es als Alternative nur noch die Sternweisse gibt.\n",

      "I in my 61 years of walking this earth, I have tried many good, high end, beers... I used to be in a group that belonged to an import beer of the week, try it club years ago... And I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, coming from a can, in a Pizza Place..... I loved the taste, and I loved that it had no harsh after taste... I also loved that it DID NOT make me congested, or have stuffy sinuses like most things with wheat in them.... I also did not get the day after beer, short temper with this one... Kudos to the brewers, I think you are on to something here.... I will definitely try this one again... I think it has shot to the top of my list.... I will be looking for this one....\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a clear gold color with medium foamy slightly creamy head. Aroma is Sweet corn malt, slight earthy hops, slight caramel note, slight bread yeast note and slight nuttiness note aswel. Taste follows the aroma well with a medium to light mouthfeel. Excellent Lager!\n",
      "Better than Bud Light. At least it has flavor. In my opinion its one of the best light beers out there.\n",
      "Bottle. Clear ruby with beige head. Aroma is toffee, glue. Good nose but disappointing taste. Rather sweet with very strong esthers and alcohol. High bitterness behind all the sweet. Not for me.\n",

      "Hazy, pale yellow. Aroma of moldy towel and sweat. There’s fruitiness underneath but it’s getting overwhelmed. Taste is crisply bitter, full of sweaty rag and citrus. Finishes bitter. Can’t get past that aroma..\n",
      "Beautiful crisp tasting ale, very refreshing on a summer's day, lovely strong blueberry taste\n",
      "Radler is my FAVOURITE drink. I love the Orange flavour slightly more, but I love the Lemon flavour as well. Please , please supply Radler 2% to Durban in South Africa. We deserve to appreciate the flawless taste of Radler! Thank you.\n",

      "Thanks for this site that does more than accept opinions that the site agrees with and not much else. Sites that claim to be your \"advocate\" do little other than support HOPS OVERLOADED beers. Is that really beer???? I think not.\n",
      "250 mL can from Cellars, Neenah, 6/24/19. Very slightly hazy pale gold, no head. Aroma of insanely bitter and astringent hops, like sniffing metal. Some pear in there but the only way to tell that was to smell it THROUGH my shirt. Fuck. Taste is... and I'm scared... vegetal, bitter, metallic hops, dry pear. Insanely bad. Fuck this shit. I was wary of this given the low ratings, but nothing could have prepared me for something this bad. I'm even afraid to pour it down the drain for fear it will burn through the pipes. This literally hurt. These people should be ashamed of themselves.\n",

Another favourite is Bush and Molson Dry. Molson Dry was a cheaper brew compared to Canadian but has made a rebound in price for some reason making it less attractive.\n",

      "Fresh out of a Beer52 box, which I presume is where they all come from.  Did not like at all.  Dark beer, pours with no head.  Good thick mouthfeel, although odd at the abv and type.  Flavours just didn't work at all for me, far too much going on and did not compliment one another.  Its a no from me.\n",

      "But, it isnt.  No heavy character, as is with most German Dunkels.  Dunkel, loosely translated, means \"liquid bread\".  This isnt.  It is as  if they brewed a lager and added dark food coloring, that is how this tastes.  There is no genuine malt presence.  It is dark in your glass, but not in taste.  The finish has no \"bread\".\n",

      "Bottle - this is like drinking alcoholic pineapple juice without the hard alcohol influence. Great gold color, incredible aroma and light refreshing taste. I have a sweet tooth so it&aposs right up my alley! Definitely recommend on a hot day where you don&apost want to go heavy. \n",

      "---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone\n",
      "Undrinkable, had to pout the can out. So sour that over whelms everything, not sure how anyone can taste anything else.\n",
      "This is light, crisp and clean low ABV lager, currently brewed by the depot in Reno I find myself drinking this quite often in the summertime it’s nice and refreshing, no off flavors & a nice clean finish, pretty close to perfect for an American style lager.\n",

      "* Overall not enjoyable. 2/5\n",
      "Tastes as good as any other beer.   It's better than many.   It's low cost.\n",
      "Pours the color of orange soda, with a white head and thick lacing.  The label says ale, no mention of IPA, so was caught a bit off guard with the bitterness.   If there is orange in it other than the color, both the aroma and the flavor is totally masked by the hops.  Bitter finish and probably will appeal to the IPA drinkers, which is why it should say IPA on the label!\n",
      "Unfortunately I've tasted sick that tastes better than this, please stop selling this. or at least provide Rennie when you sell this.\n",

      "Burk. Det här var verkligen ingen höjdare. Smakar för mycket av allt - på en och samma gång - och för lite öl. Bären och humlen skär sig. Alldeles för sött.\n",
      "En rigtig god alkoholfri øl. Den har ingen syrlighed, og den har en fi humlet eftersmag.\n",
      "Imho by far the worst smoke beer of my region (Bamberg-Franconia), no character at all. Absolutley no comparison to Spezial or even Hönig Posthörnla. I will never drink that again\n",

      "WAY overhyped and WAY WAY overpriced, Kentucky Breakfast Stout from Founders is the Poster Beer for exactly what is wrong with the hipster-driven corporatification of the craft brew movement.\n",
      "Sorry to say, this tastes nothing like a dark amber. The best that I can describe is that it has the aroma of soap with the finish of blueberries. Doesn’t live up to the name Hellraiser.\n",
      "Super rindy grapefruit hazy IPA. Too much. Boring. Trendy. Not in balance. May as well chew on a grapefruit peel.  Rubber plant overtones. Screw this stuff.  Give me anything else.\n",

      "Wow. Heinous. Lacks the subtlety of say A Leinenkugels Orange Shandy which tastes like Lager flavored with orange oil. Not a hint of sugar. BLO tastes exactly like  a 2:1 mix of Bud Light and Fanta Orange... Sweetness and all. Gross.  Truly gross.  I actually don't mind Bud Light Lime for making Micheladas at home, because it doesn't come across as sweet; just fizzy yellow American beer with a lime in it. The neutral (to be kind) flavor doesn't mess with the other components of of the tomato-y, spicy drink.  Unless you are a wasted sorority girl on Spring Break in Daytona; avoid at all costs.\n",

      "The aroma of kombucha, pear, lemon, and herbal notes are sensed as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kombucha tea is watery and makes the beer easy to drink. The tea aspect gives a domineering pear sensation. Cherries slightly tarts the complexion along with sweetening the tone. Ginger spices the take and lingers into the dry finish. Clove illuminates the pear timbre. Lemon compliments the pear and cherry flavors. Wheat fairly textures the mouthfeel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kulture Clash is an amazing Imperial Blonde blended with kombucha tea. The kombucha used delivers an impeccable experience despite this beer coming across as a kombucha instead of a beer. The cherry and ginger are a beautiful compliment to the lemon and pear. As a final product, I think it is an outstanding. This is exciting to drink that will leave an impression upon you.\n",

      "Weirdly, in a former life, I tried one of the first beers ABK’s produced 700 years ago, according to the beer glass this was poured in. \n",
      "I am glad to report it tastes exactly the same! Crisp golden pour, citrus lime notes on the nose. Mango finish (not really).!A solid German beer that is consistent with its brewing tradition but I was pretty pied when I served this so let’s just say ‘Ein Prosit’ and be done with it. Definitely recommend\n",
      "Translated as Cold Mountain: the kingly Bavarian Beer. This malt, toffee, caramel brew was very nice. A golden orange pour with a small head. Lovely smooth mouth feel. And nice refreshing finish. Wunderba\n",
      "I've become a fan of wheat beers. By chance, I found a couple of cans of Kaiserdom in China. After I tasted it, I had to get more. This is one of the best.\n",
      "Tastes almost like a session IPA.... WITH CITRUS OF COURSE! Michigan craft brewers are just flat out awful right now. The obsession with hops and fruit is not only puzzling, it’s piss poor brewing. Shame on this “lager” and Michigan craft brewing as a whole.\n",
      "Sampled on draft this beer poured a yellow gold color with a medium sized foamy white head that left good lacing. The aroma was pot, skunk, earthiness and a hint of fruit. The flavor was intense skunky pot and a bit of mango. Long finish. Disgusting.\n",
      "Bottled June 6, 2017\n",

      "My rating: NA - Infected beer!\n",
      "Bottled beer served in Shoeburyness, end of the line. Not a good beer, far from being a good beer. It reminded me of a strong lager with that nasty syrupy taste. Yuck, yuck and double yuck. Vicious, you hit me with a flower.\n",
      "Crisp filtered golden body. Light notes on the nose. Fresh zingy sharp citrus taste on the mouth. Short finish. Another one of Munich’s classic breweries ( In my humble option; not as nice as some of Munich’s others, good none the less and heir Hefeweizen is beautiful)\n",
      "In Bavaria they like to call a spade a spade. Especially if you’re  a beer, which they also like to call a Spade. Literally. \n",
      "As has been well documented beer has experienced a real renaissance in recent years, especially amongst the New wave craft brewery’s who really ate taking beer ‘to the limit and beyond’. It is nice therefore to remind ourselves once in a while that some people have been doing this for centuries. German Monks mainly.\n",
      " Spartan is one of Bavaria’s core beers bound by their purity laws. This makes it so excellent. A clear golden pour, crisp refreshing and date that slips down so smoothly. And a finish that plays your spine like a xylophone! Delicious \n",
      "Prost!\n",

      "Bought a six pack of cans at wholefoods. Tastes like a cheap sweet wine. Really disappointed.\n",

      "I bought this at my local Foods Co about 2 weeks ago and had a sudden craving for the authenticity of the mango taste paired with the clamtato and other mixes that make this a michelada. Unfortunately when i went back to FoodsCo they were all sold out. I decided to try the liquor store across from foodsco and i was in luck. I bought 4 x 25 oz cans. For me the taste is just as refreshing as the can looks. It is not too thick and smells as expected...just like a mango michelada.\n",
      "Not an advert, but at £.80p a bottle if you order 3x24 cases to avoid delivery charge.\n",

      "Very low calorie where all sugar turns to alcohol- so pretty much Carb free (about 2g a bottle)\n",
      "\n",
      "Like others have said, ignore The CAMRA beer snobs who don’t seem to understand that this is brewed this way deliberately to keep the calories down.  What on earth do they expect??\n",
      "Not sure what to make of this bit sour and ciderish.  Each to their own but I was shocked by how poor this was\n",
      "I know I like to shit on this brewery sometimes for their funky concoctions, but truth is they can make regular beers very well. Which is probably why I call them out - they make way too many beers that don't taste like beer. Now often, they amaze me as they can make these weird flavors taste good in beer, and make them taste authentic. But also, it's usually nothing more than a sip and \"oh, that's neat\" before you want to move on. Can you drink a pint of one of those weird sweet flavored beers? Fuck no. Now on to the current rating. The Margarita Gose falls into their concoction category. So it is one of those \"oh, it's neat, tastes like a margarita, now back to beer\" reactions? Hell no it isn't. This is some awful shit right here. Sour with weird lime flavors, strange bitterness, vomit-esque finish. Two sips. Then shared two sips with others, who equally hated it. Then a third sip to confirm what I was tasting. Then down the drain. Guess what - I'll take the blame for wasting $15 on a 4-pack from a brewery known for making stupid fucking beers. But also guess what - this is the last time I spend any money on Funky Buddha. Fuck you assholes.\n",

      "The most convincing NA beer I know. Most friends who have tried this out of a pint glass have got half way through before I've broken it to them, then it's a bit of double checking the label. Fantastic mouthfeel and flavour is perfectly thirst quenching. A fairly old fashioned bitter style, not to mad on the hops, but plenty of flavour.\n",
      "A fantastic beer with a bad reputation, which is a shame. In a blind taste test with Leffe Blonde I challenge you to tell the difference. In fact i prefer it. One of my favourite beers. Moderation is key.\n",
      "Can shared from Tavour. The beer is a hazy gold with a big head of white foam. The aroma is pretty raunchy and earthy. Smells a bit like funky sweat. Taste is a bit off putting as well. Medium body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "Bottle at Farmhouse Fest 2019, pours a hazy blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out passionfruit, and sulphuric notes. Flavour is messed up, with rubber, subdued passionfruit, and sulphuric notes. There is something wrong here. Very sulphuric.\n",

      "0.5l bottle. Amber color, small dirty white head. You can smell ginger and lemon aroma. Nicely balanced, closer to the sweet side. Flavour is lemon, ginger, maybe a touch of orange. Gingerroot aftertaste. I quite enjoyed it.\n",
      "Clear red colour with a large,pink head. Aroma is malty, wheat, yeasty, and fruit like cherry. Flavor sweet and tart. You find flavours that remind you of pear cider, with a sweet and light yeast flavour.  A lot of colour but unfortunately the flavour do not live up to that, and i missing the cherry flavour.\n",
      "Orange golden hazy appearance with a frothy head. Typical grapefruit smell of an IPA with a smell of oranges and cloves which makes it taste like a fruity gingerbread. Frankly the best low alcohol beer I ever drank. I'm not even missing the full amount of alcohol in this one. I'm surprised it's possible to make a low alcohol IPA.\n",
      "Take this beer for what it is:\n",
      "Easy drinking.\n",
      "Cheap\n",
      "You need a 24 that will last a few days at the cottage and goes down easy then this is it. I enjoy a good hoppy beer or strong ale for flavour but I enjoy this beer more when I want to crush back a few on a summer day.  Maybe not as good as some lagers out there but nothing to complain about.  I wouldn't mind a stronger alcohol content.  Solid 3.5 stars out of 5 for me.\n",
      "This beer was recommended to me by a friend who was delighted with him. For me, the beauty of this beer turned out to be only in that it was produced in Hawaii because I live in Russia.\n",
      "Pours black with a small head.\n",
      "Nose shows liquorice, port-like notes, vegemite, raisins, booze, oxidised notes and chocolate.\n",
      "Flavours include more roasted malt, liquorice, hot booze, oxidised notes and vegemite.\n",
      "This taste like Coors Banquet and could very well come out of the same tanks but it is more expensive so I don't buy it very often.\n",
      "This is good beer.  I would buy it more often but I feel like I'm getting screwed because the bottle is only 11.5 oz.  What is that all about?\n",
      "Great beer.  Great choice.  This page indicates that Pilsner is Lager.  A lot of people have a hard time grasping that pilsner is lager.\n",
      "This is an awesome beer.  But, it aggravates me that they stole the Silver Bullet nickname from Sterling 16 oz cans.\n",
      "This is Budweiser's answer to Coors Light an Miller Lite.  One can't go wrong with it if they're in the mood for a light beer.  It has a crown on the bottle cap because it's in the King of Beers family.\n",
      "Of course this is good beer.  It's the beer that made Boulder famous. I love this beer and wish that I got invited to banquets more often so I could drink more of it.\n",
      "Not enough taste for me.  But, it is available everywhere in any packing  and size that one needs.\n",
      "Excellent summer beer. Light with just a hint of fruit.  This is my new favorite!\n",
      "Currently, my preferred beer.  But, it's very hard to find in a 12 oz. bottle and 6 pack.  Pabst is packed with taste.  I amazed that Miller Coors brews a better beer this good as a co-packer.  This is the same stuff that won the blue ribbon.\n",

      "Refreshing and affordable.  Rolling Rock is what beer should be.  Taste buds change throughout one's life.  Currently, I'm a light lager guy.  (When I was a young buck, my beers looked like used motor oil.)  You can't go wrong with Rolling Rock.  If you buy it can, I recommend pouring it in a glass.\n",
      "Bottle. Looks like cloudy, purple Kool-aid. Aroma is fruity and funky. Taste is blackyberry, sour and funky.\n",
      "I saw this in Sainsbury’s and decided to give it a go. Having had many demi-peches in the Alps I wanted to see how it compared. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pouring, it had a good light peach aroma and was pale yellow with a good head. Took my first sip and it took me right back to the Alps. Amazingly refreshing like a fruit cider but with a dry finish of a lager. It went down way too quick – sign of a good beer.\n",
      "$2 can from vintage estate. A slightly deeper yellow than pale. Big foam y head, more than half of glass is foam, even with a gentle pour. Head goes craggy, unrelenting. Smell is typical rough volatile IPA. First tate is all IPA, bitter nasty resinous mouth coating chewing on green grapefruit rinds mixed with pine tar. What else can be said? Its just another of a million typically ubiquitous IPA that treads into double imperial IPA territory. IPA, the beer with a preservative in it. Rude mah-fah.\n",
      "Good, cheap drinking beer.  Must be popular, because always sold out.  Much better than competitors.\n",
      "I dont like bock bier, but i heard before that i should try this one. I bought it in Erfurt and i drink it during my train journey eastwards. Oh boy, this one is good one. Probably one of the best i ever haved. Complex taste, subtle aroma. Made me relaxed so quickly. Thuringen knows how to do it. Bravo.\n",
      "Well, i really enjoyed that beer. It reminds me those flavours, how used to good Polish beer tasted like. It is drinkable indeed, but in its own way. At the beginning one is being overwhelmed with hoppy flavours, only to smoothly face a new taste, more watery, however classic. I love it. One of the best Pilseners I ever haved. Thanks.\n",
      "It’s like the great value version of Sam Adams’s porch rocker (which is 100% better FYI) it’s like someone made a drink half natural light half watered down powdered lemonade... nasty\n",
      "\n",
      "All the worst qualities of a coconut water with a healthy dose of 8% alcohol.\n",
      "Excelente olor afrutado, no mucha espuma pero es blanca y se adhiere bien. Muy fácil de beber, sabor intenso de la malta incluso dulce como el cereal del desayuno. Sensación de cuerpo y carbonatacion en la boca, amargor apenas perceptible.\n",
      "Nice pilsner backbone with slight corny sweetness. Very low hop\n",
      "Bitterness. Appearance: Nice Yellow light lager with a crisp, thin head. True to style, enjoy seeing quality competition in the Mexican style market.\n",
      "12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Didn't know what the fuck kind of beer this was when I bought the sixpack. There is some lame description on the packaging. The brewers never got around to stating exactly what type of beer I was buying. So, what I end up with is expensive and boring amber ale. My advice is not to bother with this one as it is a shit beer on par with budzilla. Everyone who buys this kat piss by mistake, like I did, should demand their money back!\n",
      "The best beer I have ever had. Good first flavor. Nice color. Fantastic aftertaste. Can’t find it anymore. Alas, you find a great beer, then it disappears. :~{\n",

      "I'm on a diet so wanted to see if these will help as I love a drink and I'm not disappointed, it's not the best beer in the world but it is quite refreshing, crispy dry-nessss. A little bitterness and can taste hops and malts. It would be nothing special if it wasn't 89 calories. It deserves a high score cos I can at least drink this in the knowledge it's low calorie. 1 or 2 of these and a cloudwater not a bad night\n",

      "Decent real ale. Crisp, clear and refreshing. A light bitter finish. It's a go to beer for me for many years. First time drinking it for a good few months but it's still the same real ale I know and love. It's not a cloudwater and never will be but it's a decent beer\n",
      "A very fine summer beer which I have been enjoying at the Hawk Inn, Amport.  It will be very sad if this vanishes.\n",
      "It was appealing to me the idea of having a beer with a natural citrus flavor so I tried the lime one, it is good, but the orange one is great. It offers a very refreshing taste that smoothens the customary beer flavor, being still a beer....\n",
      "\n",
      "Great for these hot summer days !.\n",
      "Thin pale clear yellow with a fair amount of carbonation in the form of tiny bubbles.  Slight malt aroma with a thin body and bland taste.  Not much going on with this one.  Spanish immigrants prefer Miller Lite and Bud Light so I'm not so sure of the push for these styles here lately.\n",
      "Quit hating it’s Budweiser you know what you’re getting is it amazing no but it gets the job done pretty similar in taste to other beers of the style but it also has this unique bud taste I reckon it’s from the rice overall there’s a reason everyone knows someone who drinks bud because it’s solid and consistent\n",

      "No head which is disappointing.  Very carbonated and fruity.  Tastes more like some kind of mixed drink than a beer.  Won’t get it again.  Why is the overall rating on this beer so high?   Misleading...this is pretty bad.\n",
      "This beer sucks!! I’ve been drinking new castle for over 20 years! I took one drink of this shit and knew it wasn’t right I was never a big fan of lagunitas to begin with but now I will never buy any of there products just for ruining my beer!!!!🤬🤢\n",
      "Bottle, 750 ml. Pours a ruby red with a thin white short lasting head. Aroma is funky and wild yeast with a hint of horse manure. Taste is really sour with immature cherries and a flat aftertaste. I'm not impressed with this one. Really flat with no nuances. Almost undrinkable.\n",

      "I did not like the Fat Tug IPA personally. On the nose it smells really hoppy, and I would say it tastes almost exactly how it smells at first.. The description on the can says it's balanced with malt, and oh boy is it ever... too much so in my opinion. I'm not even a big hops guy, I enjoy a mild amount but the Fat Tug just has too much hops at first followed by too strong of a malt aftertaste. I think it would be better for me personally if it committed more to a hoppy taste, which is what myself and others are probably expecting from an IPA. For people who love a combination of both at the same time though, this might do it for you.\n",
      "This beer taste like when you play outside in elementary school in the dirt then you put hand sanitizer on and lick ur hands\n",
      "Can: Canned beans smell, very vegetal, rye. Clear amber, thick head and good lacing. Apricot, significant DMS. Medium body,easy carbonation.\n",
      "Can from cloudwater website. Came in a blue can. Massive head on pouring. Lager is Light, nearly clear as water with a shade of yellow. Lemon, grass, malty, a litter bitterness. Crisp, refreshing. I'm impressed I actually thought I wouldn't like this one, I only bought to review it. I'd definitely buy this again\n",
      "A favorite of mine since the early days. However recent draft taps are noticeably different. Far less taste, almost a \"watered-down\" version. Bottles seemed to have escaped the change or have not hit the market yet. I will look for it but only in bottles for now. My ratings below are for the recent drafts. I hope 3 Floyds realizes their mistake and goes back to the prior formula!\n",
      "Rating this beer on what it's intended to be. Every once in awhile you need a break from kind beers and want something cold and sessionable. That's what this is and it's perfect. It's cheap, perfect for summer, and a great shot chaser. Cheers.\n",
      "Can’t believe people bashed this beer. It’s smooth has great flavor and no bad aftertaste. I love it. I think they nailed it. I wish I could get it in my own state of Indiana.\n",
      "Amazing flavor with no bitterness or sharp ending. Really unique flavor for a hard cider.\n",
      "Old ass bottle. Poured mahogany with all head. Noted that this was way past its prime and infected. My bad for forgetting about it ...\n",
      "Strong Grassy and citrusy IPA smell... taste isn't quite as bad but too bitter for me...some malty mouthfeel but all bitterness and one dimentional...too strong\n",
      "Cloudy amber, head fades immediately. Nose of wine and harsh alcohol. Thin for style. Malt, wood, fruit and alcohol. Drain pour for me\n",
      "Smells like a urinal cake honestly...taste is kinda nasty too at first...sourness on front end is good but it turns into bitter grapes...nothing good here :( sounded great though\n",

      "Easiest review ever..... Stop reviewing now.. Wards best and stones bitter originally brewed in sheffield.. These beers need to brewed in sheffield again. You can not recreate these two beers anywhere else to the same taste.. This is because the water anywhere else is not from sheffield. Recipe same water not.. If u like these beers now your being cheated. The taste was and always will be better brewed in sheffield.. I am a true sheffield lad. Since brewed elsewhere not been same for twenty yesrs. New brewers have bastardized the beer.. End of..\n",

      "Steel Reserve Alloy Series Hard Pineapple has a thin, white head, a hazy, alert yellow appearance, with fierce carbonation and no lacing. The aroma is of pineapple and pale malt.

      "I used to love Troegs. When I moved to Harrisburg in 1995, I considered I was blessed with a local craft brewery. I'm a IPA guy and a true Hop Head. This year's Nimble Giant is over rated and way over priced. It pours clear with a nice head. It has the usual back flavors of an IPA and at 9% the ABV is not overpowering. But for $75 a case it is way overpriced for an AVERAGE IPA.\n",
      "The label tells me it's the World Beer Awards World's Best IPA so I'm basing my review on expectations. Aroma is of beer, appearance; beer, taste; beer, mouthfeel; well, beer. Overall; bland. If this is the best IPA in the world them I'm off to find a bottle of rice water which will taste just as good/bad. This is utter pish.\n",

      "What's with all the low ratings? This beer is a real crowd pleaser on a hot day. I can't tell you how many comments I've gotten from people that it is one of the best lagers they have ever had, ever. And these are mostly from beer drinkers in Seattle who love IPAs, but on a hot summer day a Gaffel Kolsch is just the thing. It sells out at our local boutique store throughout the summer and even sometimes the big chains. Seriously shocked at the 1, 2, 3 star reviews. This is good beer! Maybe y'all just don't like lagers.\n",
      "I like 211s but didn't have two dollars in my pocket at the time only a dollar so I went to my local liquar asked if he had an dollar beers he said Dead Presidents I never heard of it after looking around I found it. The can had Thomas Jefferson on it can was cool enough but people don't buy beer because of the can. I bought it for a dollar and was very impressed so I bought more. I found it in Riverside,Ca.\n",
      "I know it's all a matter of taste and individual perception, but I don't know how some people here have given this beer a 1 or 1.5 rating. I have tried almost every beer sold in the USA, and this is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best. Besides the aroma, the color, the taste and the high alcohol content, I don't get migraines from drinking this beer! Almost every other brand triggers my migraine. Fan for the rest of my life.\n",

      "bleh.  tastes like budweiser.  not what I expected.  I had to check the expiration date to make sure it hadn't gone bad before opening a second can.  I would NOT recommend this beer to anyone who likes beer.....unless, of course, you like budweiser, coors, natural light type crappy beers.  What a disappointment.\n",
      "Draft in a nice glass with beer name. Fruity taste with a full creamy head and thick taste. Enjoyed with and without food. I would have as a draft Again.\n",
      "650 mL bottle. Deep amber. Smells oxidized. Cardboard, fruit, sherry. Tastes of a hint of bourbon. Then cardboard. Sweet brown sugar. Back end is cardboard again. Not easy to drink. Way too old.\n",
      "Not had for a long time and shocked at some of the reviews, but I have to speak as I found and all those years ago this was a lovely tasty light beer great with smoked cheese and ham.\n",
      "I didn't realize what this beer referred to when I purchased it...If so, I would have never made the purchase.  Awful aroma, mouthfeel and taste...Corona would be the only comparison I could make with this swill.  After this multi-millionaire visiting the brewery in 2004 and having his family treated like white trash from the bar guy....I can see why they decided to produce this garbage.\n",
      "Orange cloudy pour, half inch white head. Looks like an ipa. Roasty wood aroma, coriander and orange peel, marshmallow. Super low carbonation, light and frothy mouthfeel, finishes clean. Flavor is grainy, like grain belt but more mellow and more malt, orangey coriander, chalky marshmallow, acidic weathered wood. Not good, avoid.\n",
      "Delicious! One of my favorites. A little high in calories for the small bottle, but I still enjoy it as a special treat. It isn’t too sweet and it goes down smooth.\n",
      "I personally love it. I enjoy dry cider and it’s  one of the best I’ve had. I enjoy the fact it’s so slow in carbs and sugar too; it’s not too sweet and I don’t feel bloated after having it.\n",
      "23.06.2019, 0,5l can @ home:\n",
      "Nice fizzy-creamy mediumlasting head, cloudy light orangy color.

Taste is harsh sour-ish floral, weeds, booze, bark, hay, flowers, minerals, dusty harsh hops, sawdust, soil, paper, light malts, soap. Longlasting harsh bitterness, dry boozy mouthfeel. Meh!\n",
      "It's beautiful. Just shut up and drink it. If you're worried about beer, find another hobby. Riddles are great on the lid of the bottle.\n",
      "Flaska från SB, drygt två år gammal. Klar, bärnstensfärgad med smutsvit krona som lämnar rester efter sig. Obalanserat spritig med viss ton av vanilj och andra typiska fattoner längre bak. Svårt att ta sig förbi sprit-tonen som mer drar åt aceton än specifikt bourbon. Humlet fortfarande någorlunda vid liv, men som med de flesta av det här upp-pumpade och fatlagrade dubbel/trippel-iporna så smakar det mest som en klenare amerikansk barleywine. Förstår verkligen inte poängen med det. Det sämsta av flera världar.\n",

Aroma of apple and muted citrus. Taste is apples, orange, citrus. I guess there'd be more taste if I poured in that nasty looking sludge. Not willing to do so. This is a train wreck.\n",

Its a volatile nose of yer favorite girl, right after a heated debate. Taste is bitter bastard. Yes, typical sharp ass IPA all the way. It does let you know its near 7% fer sher. Big, straight up ass, beer. So much, so rude. Quite an attitude. Even becomes hop perfumy in the middle, like tasting hop perfume, that is. Yes, terrible blow by blow of sweet syrupy hop perfume. Then its bitter, yes, sharply bitter, same thing every slug. Go figger. What else can be said? Its just another rubbery mouth coating ubiquitous IPA; there are a ton out there, and a half-ton all taste the same - just like this.\n",

Sorry lil ones, Germany has been brewing beer for over 1,000 years.  Your USA crap is barely a decade old.    This Wisconsin beer, brewed by a German brewery in the great state of Wisconsin, is a GREAT beer brewery.  Try any Leinie, they are all great.

      "Oh wow another ipa, what else is new? Nothing to write home about, it’s one of those beers the sheep drink because everyone else is drinking it. It’s not bad, just not great.\n",
      "Garbage. Food coloring, soda like carbonation, overpriced for being a cheaply put together beer.\n",

      "Can at Craig's. Pours hazy yellow, nose is floral, farts, onion, taste is similar, harsh.\n",

Yes, big bitter banging bungalow blasting bastardized bowling ball backdoor bandit badger baked buggerring beached whale. BTW, this is just IPA, not really double or impy IPA. Just saying. There you have it!\n",

      "On tap. Funky peachy tart aroma. Taste of peach, sweet but leading into a big sour finish.. delicious.\n",
      "650 ml bottle from Canada Craft Club.  Pours a cloudy brown colour with modest-sized light tan head.   Aroma is big coffee with a little vanilla and roast.  Flavour is lots of coffee, some cocoa and vanilla with a bit of a bourbon touch.  Fine carbonation.  Nice.\n",
      "Pours a hazy, mustard yellow, with minimal head. Aroma is dank, with stinky cheese, some tropical and citrus notes. Flavor is sweet, with citrus and tropical fruit, just a slight touch of alcohol burn. Almost no hop bite in the finish. Smooth, soft mouthfeel.\n",
      "Pint at the Hurricane Oyster Bar in Grayton Beach. Pours a clear, golden color, with a medium, frothy, off-white head. The nose is heavy mango, pineapple, hay and dust, wet grass, and corn syrup. Sweet and sugary, with a mild bitterness. Light body, with a fluffy, clean palate. This is a fun, fruity wheat, although the initial nose just reminds me of burning trashcan smell of potheads.\n",
      "Pours hazy apricot that lets through just a little daylight at the edges. Ivory head is thick and tight. Aroma provides resiny and slightly dank hops, raw malt, tangy and slightly sweet citrus. Flavor offers piney and funky hops, raw malt, tangy and tart citrus, a hint of hay. Texture gives good body and perky fizz. After midnight, we're gonna drink some good craft beer.\n",
      "Large off white head with good retention and a nice lace. Lightly hazy blond. Nose is mango and a little citrus. Body is medium, ain’t juicy, prickly carbo. Just some lightly sweet pale malts and lightly fruity hops. Dry, lightly bitter finish. Seems SN is trying a bit too hard. 12oz can from statelineliquors.\n",
      "Can from the brewery. Pours hazy orange/red with a thin, fizzy head. Tastes like tart citrus, berry, cookie malt, and sour yeast. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like berry, yeast, sour dough, and cookie malt.\n",
      "Pours a flat white wine, soft pear on the nose with a hint of vanilla. Flavour is very soft pear mixed with some more vanilla. Full on the mouth the alcohol is well hidden, but it's rather uninteresting.\n",
      "Pours with soft brown body and minimal foam, smells of brown sugar and those cheap halloween candies. Flavour is soft caramel and mountain due. Mouthfeel is cloying. This is a big miss for an ESB.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin head that dissipates quickly and completely. Aroma has slightly dark grains with toffee, light dark berries and a bit of apple brandy underlying. Flavor has slightly dark grains and toffee with touches of apple brandy, blackberry and a hint of caramel backing.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Woodman's Appleton, 2/6/20. Murky orange, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of dank, melon, pale malt and a bit of toast. Taste is resin, melon, dank, yuzu, pale malt. Medium bodied, low bitterness.\n",
      "Pours with good beige foam on a nice black body, smells of nice sweet dark milk chocolate. Flavour is good sharp cocoa with hints of sweet barley. Nice dryness on the mouth. This is decent and filling.\n",
      "Pint at the Hurricane Oyster Bar. Pours a clear, brown color, with a small, beige head. The aroma is caramel, resin, toffee, rose, and wheat bread. Sweet and malty, with a mellow bitterness. Light to medium body, with a thin, sharp palate. Mediocre aromatics for an IPA, and pretty thin and weak. Fair.\n",
      "Can from Bottles in Providence, RI.  Very cloudy yellow-white, thin white medium-coarseness and moderate retention head.  Aroma is lovely big mango and dry mango, some dank onion, some passionfruit, some orange, touch of lime.  This smells lovely.  Medium weight, starchy semi-textured, slightly oily feel, medium-light carbonation, medium-coarseness, medium-light burn, silky.  Nice feel!  Flavor is sharp mango, bitter grapefruit, some dank herbs and onion, some orange, bit of tree sap, lingering green citrus and light rind bitterness.  Light and neutral barely balancing sweetness.  This is pretty great!\n",
      "Draft at Cellarmaker on nitro. Dark brown with a lasting tan head. Aroma is roast, coffee, cocoa, earth. Flavor is dry and super balanced. Roasty, earthy, very nice. Medium body with a very smooth feel. Hell of a mild.\n",

      "500 ml bottle pours a reddish color with a small white head.  Aromas of blackberries, stone fruit, light wine.  Medium bodied, very complex, a great beer.\n",
      "Pours slightly hazy, light butterscotch. Light, hop aroma. Taste is floral, and tropical fruit, with a moderate bitter finish. It has a \"juicy\" palate. Very drinkable. (IBU not listed on can)\n",
      "Bottle from friend. Pours brown coffee some head and lacing. Notes are cinnamon, chocolate, lactose. Taste huge sweet, medium bitter. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "Can from friend. Well, it does what it says. Pours light brown lots of head and lacing. Nose is massive smell of butter tart. Notes are butter tarts... raisins, brown sugar, burnt butter, nutty. Taste huge sweet, light bitter. Light body lively carbonation. I think I have a cavity now.\n",
      "12 oz can from Tavour, 2/6/20.  Pours purple, smallish head, no lace.  Smells like Manischewitz.  Tastes along the same lines.  Bit of vanilla, slightly.  This works better as a beer than it does as a Passover wine, but it's still not amazing.  Concord grapes might be a fruit that's just better for eating than drinking.  I think it's well made, no complaints there.  \n",

      "Can from friend. Pours brown coffee some head and lacing. Notes are roasted grain, some espresso, light tart berries. Taste medium bitter medium sweet. Medium creamy body lively carbonation.\n",
      "Gift from a friend. Thanks a bunch Becky! Kona coffee, wormwood, honey nose. Hazy amber, medium cream colored head, effervescent. Sweet honey and coffee, molasses. Full body, easy carbonation. Much sweeter than it needs to be.  The coffee used is not my favorite either. Still, I'm stoked I got to try this and enjoyed it.\n",
      "Firm medium size head with good retention and nice lace. Murky blond color. Nose of grapefruit, hint of sulfur. Medium body, not really “pillowy” as advertised, hint juicy. Little grainy, little citrus, little catty and maybe a hint of bandaids. Dry finish, citrus. Tangy.\n",
      "Can from friend. ours clear golden some head and lots of lacing. Notes of grapefruit, grassy, pine. Taste light bitter light sweet. Medium body lively carbonation. Well done.\n",
      "A:toasty malts, caramel, light roasted malts. App: deep reddish brown with smallish beige head. T/p: full body with sweet finish of average duration. Soft to moderate carbonation O: Pretty good. I won't lie, I was a bit surprise by the roasty malts but it doesn't feel too out of style. Good maltiness.\n",
      "75CL, acquired in 2014 and forgot I had it. Finally opening February of 2020. \"will age for decades\" so let's see :) Dark reddish color, had a 7-up kind of carbonation when I poured it. can smell sweet syrupy brandy from a few feet away. maple syrup, baked apples and cinnamon aroma. wow, this has blended and aged so well. soggy oak, burnt sugar, vanilla, bible paper, ice cream, candied sugar and more apple. little bits of cherry and lovely smokey flavor with an oily grain alcohol finish. Easily the best of the anniversary beers.\n",
      "Can from friend. Pours clear golden lots of head and some lacing. Notes are very floral and very fruity, lemon, grain, citrus. Taste light bitter light sweet. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "The Aromas are crackers, Hops, straw and pale malt. Flavors are a little more sweet than light bitter. Very mild, hops and whole home. Okay body. Carbonation and finish. Boulevard could have done better with this.\n",

      "Can from Liberty store. Pours black lots of head and lacing. Notes are milk chocolate, roasted marshmallows, coffee. Big sweet, medium bitter. Creamy body medium carbonation.\n",
      "16 oz draft pours an light orange color with a small white head.  Aromas of citrus, pine, resin, a good old fashioned west coast IPA.  Medium bodied, nicely balanced, a very good beer.\n",
      "12.7 oz corked and caged. About a year and a half old. Aroma is raspberry, Band-Aid, medicinal. Pours slightly hazy ruby red with a crackling, quickly dissipating head. Taste is highly sour (9/10) with flavors of raspberry, lemon; the medicinal and Band-Aid flavors are there in flavor, but not as in your face as in the nose. Flawed but drinkable.\n",
      "Can shared by beerboxer. Pours hazy gold with a nice white head and a citrus aroma. There is a hearty pale malt flavor with a dry finish.\n",
      "It's fine, I was expecting better. Paid a pretty penny for a limited imported run into Australia but isn't really that great in comparison to other milk stouts that are cheaper and more readily available here already. Tastes flat and really lacks in a defining milky taste that you'd expect from a milk stout.\n",
      "Murky golden orange pour with one finger off-white head. Some citrus and fruit in the aroma/flavor. Bright, grassy and a touch zesty. Overall, somewhat muted and one dimensionsal. I enjoyed it but wouldn't go back.\n",
      "On Tap  medium brown color and a find even thin skin of micro bubbles.  Light toasted malts and a gentle soft coffee aroma and flavor.  Very drinkable and a touch of chocolate to go with the coffee.  Probly the best and easiest drinking coffee beer Ive had.\n",
      "Pours pale gold into a stange. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to coat surface. Caramel and hay aromas. Soft with hay, grass and sourdough upfront turning to lemon/lime (?!) in the medium length finish.\n",
      "On Tap.  Classic hazy light golden straw color. Soft wheaty floral, tropical aromas and fa=lavors.  Flowery even.  Soft pillowy finish.  A littel allspice or clove at the end. A bit fancy and pretentious but pleasant and soft.\n",
      "12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.\n",
      "On Tap  Clear medium golden with a  lasting dense white head. Strang clean hard biting piney and somewhat chemically hop bitterness.   Clean dry finish\n",
      "My old man's go to. Very important to get the imported variant rather than the domestically brewed stuff. Although, it's not really that great and I'd have a few choices over it at the price point. A bit bolder than the regular macro lager, but otherwise quite standard.\n",
      "Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours hazy ruddy brown with a slight beige head. Aroma of slight musty oak and brandy. Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt. This is excellent.\n",
      "Can smell the cream, pineapple and some coconut. Get mostly cream and some sweet pineapple. Decent.\n",
      "Another lame macro lager. Boring and watery. I don't know why people bother to import this into Australia when there are a billion beers like it already available.\n",

      "16 oz. Aroma is Smarties, Tang, oranges, bready. Pours hazy golden with large-ish chunks of sediment floating around; has a one finger bone-white head with decent retention. Taste has a moderate pithy  bitterness, a light to moderate sweetness, with flavors of Tang and oranges, peel and pulp, vanilla. Not bad.\n",
      "16 ounce can.  Pours black with a decent tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, malt, vanilla, and coconut.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla, coconut, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee.  Nice to sip on.\n",
      "500 ml. bottled 10/29/2019. Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.\n",
      "Keg @ Castle Hotel, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy head.  It's certainly styled well and is crisp with a fair carbonation.  This one is for lager lovers only though.\n",
      "Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Blonde with a creamy head.  It's a very easy textured hoppy ale with some bitterness.\n",
      "An excellent example of a style I really enjoy. Light, crisp with a nice hop profile.\n",
      "Cask @ Jack In The Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Copper-red with a small head.  Has a bittered crisp hoppiness, but not that flavoursome.\n",
      "Cask @ City Arms, Manchester.  Fuller hazed yellow-amber with a frothy head.  Has a citrus hoppiness, evident in both aroma and taste.\n",
      "Cask @ Crown & Kettle, Manchester.  Practically black with a creamy-frothy off-white head.  Its' gritty, milky-sweet in its dark maltiness, and dryish, all of which is an odd mix but it just about works.  Has a denser mouthfeel than its texture would suggest.\n",
      "12 oz. can   Pours a thick, well retained, off white head, with extensive variable lacing, over a slightly hazy dark yellow (SRM 4) body.....nose is pine, resin, herbal, slight grapefruit, mild malts.......taste is mild malts, juicy taste notes with grapefruit tones, herbal hops with moderate bitter finish.....mouth feel, medium body, slight alcohol, moderate almost creamy carbonation. This is a drinkable, enjoyible IPA.\n",
      "Well I grabbed this brew from Foothills because I was curious if this was the same beer as the Cottonwood Frostbite winter ale I remember having many years ago at a beer festival. Although apparently Foothills bought out some of Cottonwood’s brands, this beer has a very different profile than what I remember of the Cottonwood rendition. Rather than being a boozy strong ale, this is a brisk clean-finishing and true-to-style black IPA with a fairly light roastiness and a balanced hoppy bitterness. The appearance was excellent also, with a bright white foamy head that almost imitated the cascading presentation of a Guinness stout. Aroma was charred wheat and herbal pacific hops, and the flavor likewise was a balanced mix of roasted malt and fresh bitter hops. Only mild disappointment with this beer was the lack of nuance - no complex chocolate or coffee notes or bold hop flavors - but that being said I enjoyed this and would pick it up again. Not my favorite black IPA, but possibly my favorite offering from Foothills Brewing.\n",
      "12 oz can. Pour is amber in color.Head is minimal but persistent. Aromas  of tropical fruit with no discernible dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp with slight bitterness. 7.2 abv is well integrated if not hidden behind the crisp bitterness of this IPA.\n",
      "375ml bottle. Clear, dark chestnut colour with ruby glimmer and small, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, beige head. Fruity, yeasty and slightly breadyand minimally nutty, malty aroma, notes of dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, sweet-ish and earthy hints of honey, some treacle, a touch of chestnut. Taste is dry, minimally sweet, minimally bitter, yeasty fruity and bready malty, notes of plum and cherry, dried fruit, raisin, fig, date, some treacle, honey, blue grapes, a touch of apple, baked apple, chestnut and even Brazil nut; minimally warming, alcoholic finish. Relatively watery texture with a minimally slimy touch, slightly prickly carbonation. Rich and complex, definitely a sipper, but partially so light and almost refreshing that you might be teased to speed up the frequency of sips into dangerous areas. Really nice and accommodating, but not exposing sufficient signs of individual character nor terroir to make a name for itself comparable to the classics in this style.\n",
      "12 oz. can purchased at Total Wine & Liquor in Colorado Springs, CO. Pours a clear dark amber color with a small khaki head and good retention. Decent lacing. Fermented caramel aroma. Clean caramel malt flavor with a short, minimal acidic finish. Low carbonation. Pretty simple and straightforward.\n",
      "Pours a clear bright golden yellow with a big foamy white head. Tart citrusy aroma. Taste is rather blah with notes of citrus rind flavor. Finishes fairly smooth with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Not very refreshing nor enjoyable.\n",

      "You can't go wrong with this. Lots of yeasty notes in both the smell and taste, caramel malt, honey, a touch of heather. It's quite full in terms of mouthfeel. Something to glug on a Sunday. Readily available and tasty. Classic.\n",
      "Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with a medium, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate roast and chocolate malt, earthy rich coffee, sweet vanilla, prunes, and a medium sweet finish. Full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "330 ml bottle. Doesnt smell like beer. Golden color big head.  Very very soft. Perfect for the beach i guess. Bad beer.\n",

      "Bought at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. \n",

Pours a slightly hazy, copper-chestnut color with an enduring film of cream. Nose of toffee, earthy peat, toasted nut, orange and a whiff of sourish apple. Flavors of the same stuff with more from the apple than indicated in the aroma. Medium bodied with a pleasant, low-medium carbonation and a nice balance. Mild astringency from the peat plus pithy hop notes help to dry the big malts quite well at the finish.\n",

      "440ml can from We Brought Beer, Balham.  Black with a tan head.  Aroma of vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, treacle and dark sugar.  They really nailed this flavour-wise.  Neither too strong on the vanilla, the lactose nor the coffee.  Just a really nice beer, with lovely nuance of flavour.\n",
      "Bottle from barrell and still shop, Plymouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Loved this, very clean amber colour appearance, no haze but a decent look to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of nice citrus notes alongside orange tints in the aroma. Juicy! Taste also has these tiny pine needles. A very sessionable pale indeed. Enjoyed it.\n",
      "[Cask at the Old Manor (JDW), Bracknell.] A pale amber pour with a tight white head; grassy aroma; and a caramel malt body; then a biscuity finish with a twiggy bitterness. A simple bitter.\n",
      "Had to get this one, if only to send a pic to my best buddy of the same name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours dark with a finger of brown head that fades to a thick ring, light lacing. Aromas are heavily roasted malt and sweet vanilla. Excellent tasting stout with mellow notes of cocoa, vanilla, and lactose sweet - none of which are overdone. Super smooth light-medium mouthfeel, and semi-bitter roasty finish. Well done!\n",
      "Black appearance with a tan head. Enticing aroma of gourmet coffee, maple syrup, mild caramel and light smoky malts. Similar flavor, rich, layered and moderately sweet with a light earthy bitterness. Medium body with a pleasant finish. Nice!\n",
      "Canned on the train.  Dark pour, malts etc and pretty oiky. Decent enough..\n",
      "Beautiful hazy gold pour, white head with nice lacing. Lots of grapefruit and lemon, oatt mouthfeel. Not bad.\n",
      "Deep orange appearance with light red hues and a white head. Smooth and fruity with pleasant sweetness and light Belgian esters. Medium to full body with a mild plum finish. Good.\n",
      "Very malt-forward for an American wheat ale, with an outsized toasted bread and caramel backbone overshadowing the more gentle grassy, fruit-tinged notes of the style. Hints of lemon and orange backed up by mild floral hops offset the malt, but it's hard to find much balance or nuance. Not bad, but not what you'd expect.\n",
      "Slightly cloudy golden pour. Thin white ring of head. Sweet honey and flower like aroma. Taste is very sweet like honey. Dandelion with some ancient yeast. Interesting complex and totally unique. Nice one.\n",
      "Acquired a can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom! Can date of 1-21-20. Is this any different than then King Julius? Maybe a tad more juice? How much juice can one IPA actually have? After reviewing my notes of king Julius...  Yes this has a huge juicy character. This also has absolutely no bitterness. No green hop either. So the fruit juice, lasts and lasts and lasts. This really is tasty. Soooo, ok... I like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il profumo esce sicuro dall'invecchiamento in botti di bourbon e il sapore ne assume senz'altro i connotati. Anche il caramello è uno dei sapori e profumi che si percepiscono bene, mentre in sottofondo si sentono agrumi e malto. Una ALE senz altro degna di nota anche se molto alcolica per i miei gusti.\n",
      "Pours light dirty water orange. Nose is citrus and pineapple, pine. Taste is citrus, lemon, grapefruit, pineapple, melted plastic citrus piss, lingering resin. Solid\n",
      "On draught at Frontier Brewing and Taproom.\n",

      "Can as a gift around X-mas.  Super cloudy, apricot in color, good head. Good lacing left on the glass. Nose of biscuits and flaked oats. Taste is tons of tropical fruits. Mango, apricot, banana, tangerine, oranges, etc. Well balanced with a good malt body.  Smooth for a 7% beer. Overall this is an easy drinking, good tasting beer.\n",
      "Bottle from Asda. A clean golden brew, thin head, nice citrus notes on the nose and palate. Good value beer.\n",
      "16 oz can from Joe Canal's, 2/6/20.  Fully hazed golden-orange color with a moderate head and some light, streaky lacework.  Orange / tangerine, vanilla and mango.  Fairly sweet.  Slightly cloying.  Pretty good, but maybe too much vanilla.  Still, pretty good overall.\n",
      "Draught. Pours lightly hazy dirty orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Heavy pine, spruce, and resin hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bready malt, light alcohol, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Clear gold pour. Thin tan ring of head. Mildly sweet malty caramel aroma. Taste is pretty much the same. Malty. Mildly sweet. Smooth easy drinker.\n",

      "Bottle at home in Hackney - sourced from online, I suppose. Pours deep brown with a modest, foamy beige head. Impressively smooth, with nice vanilla notes, rounded and relaxed chocolate character, soft roast, mocha, a little coffee ice cream and figs. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Mild warmth in the finish, nips of berries, more chocolate, some rocky road, vanilla, toasted marshmallows, burnt caramel. Excellent.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with good lacing. Moderate floral and peach hops, medium hop bitterness, medium grainy biscuit Pils malt, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Pure golden pour with a slight white head.  Toast,  caramel malt,  honey and some metallic notes from the hop bill. Clean and malty throughout.  It does one thing, but that thing is very good. A simple clean German lager.\n",
      "From a can to a glass. Pours a slightly hazy light gold color with a massive frothy creamy silky head. Aroma is dank piney hops upfront with hints of sweet bready malts. Taste follows the aroma with hints of fresh spearmint, lemon, slight earthy hops, caramel malts. Medium mouthfeel alcohol very well hidden. Awesome Dipa!\n",
      "Juicy, mild grass, very juicy appearance, bitter, grassy, fruity, thin, very drinkable 5.6%\n",
      "Gold pour, little haze, finger of white head.  Nose is citrus and grain.  Middle is blood orange (not to strong), light berry, some melon, little spice, light kilned malt. Finish is fruity and yeasty.  Nice mouthfeel for the ABV.\n",

Starts with a bitter smack  Some leathery notes and lots of toffee and caramel malt unfold next. A long earthy bitter fade follows with some citrus and berry notes. Excellent.\n",

      "Canned, 440 ml shared with Miro B, Max, Simon. Dark cloudy red with white head. Berries, vanilla, yoghurt, sweetish, some sourness. Soft texture. OK I guess, but not my favorite kind of beer.\n",
      "Bottiglia. All'olfatto si esprimono sentori di sour e di vinoso. L'olfatto viene stimolato in maniera elevata e l'esistenza olfattiva è sufficiente. Il cappello di schiuma resiste poco. La grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il liquido è di aspetto nuvoloso. Bollicine fini costituiscono la forma del perlage, con carbonazione persistente. Il colore è ambrato carico tendente rossiccio. Il corpo è pieno. L'amaro è contenuto e c'è anche una componente moderatamente acidula. La forza gustativa è elevata. La continuità gustativa è buona. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di birra beverina. Il finale è bruschino. Il retrogusto è di decente intensità. Al gusto vengono donati sentori di caramello, miele, crosta di pane, frutta secca, agrumi, pompelmo, lampone, ciliegia e vino rosso.\n",
      "Jet black colour with a large, lasting  beige head. Aromas of chocolate malt, dark berries and a hint of spice. Roast chocolate malt, blackberry and raspberry flavours in taste. Initial zesty sweetness, moving to sour notes with gooseberry and finishing with lasting strong medium bitter roast malt flavour.\n",

      "Clean nice beer crisp light and drinkable and good beer. Greta bbf 202020 birmingham\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.\n",

      "Keg @ Jack In the Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy-frothy head.  Has a light Helles styling, but is evident enough with perhaps its crispness its best feature.\n",
      "Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Darker brew with a small head. It's not overly fruity but the actual blackberry is evident within its taste.\n",
      "Bottle. Clear copper liquid with medium off-white head. Aroma of floral hops, earth, bready malt, citrus and light caramel. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter with notes of malt, wort, raw sugar and table sugar. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice aroma but overly sweet, worty taste. Same problem as many other NAs.\n",
      "Can at home. Pours black with a dirty tan head. Aroma is banana, chocolate, boozy fruit cake, molasses. Taste is a big boozy fruit cake, treacle, banana. Finishes with boozy zing. Drinks below 11%. Lovely and smooth. Great stuff\n",

      "Reddish brown beer with a medium head. A nice doppelbock with a kick. Compared to the other schlenkerla beers, this beer has a more spicy smoke tast. if the normal bock is smoked ham, this is smoked beef. Very nice\n",
      "Cask @ Crown & Kettle, Manchester.  A thick black paste with a creamy light brown head.  Has a smoother dark maltiness with lots of alcohol, and decent barrel ageing.\n",
      "Cask @ Pilcrow, Manchester.  Dark golden with a small head.  Has a mild but brash tasting bitterness, and it's somewhat dank for it.\n",
      "Schmeckt ähnlich wie Becks. Leicht herb, leicht muffige Bitterkeit und recht lieblos und wässrig.\n",

      "Clear yellow tint from a bottle. Big white head. Nose is clean beer with some lemon, barely. First taste is bubbly fun, refreshing. Not sure if I can pick out the orange but fer sher the lemon is there. Second gulp is easy going, not as much of the lemonade thing going on here like many shandies, its just good beer with a tad of citrus.   I can appreciate this more than your typical shandy, lacks the sugar factor. Makes it more like a real beer instead of lemonade. Good job peter, an example that any maker of a shandy should follow. Nothing artificial in this brew. Good co2 clear to the end. Could drink a few of these with no problem.\n",
      "Amber-brown with a settling foam, slightly artificial mango, caramel and leafy hops on the nose. The fruit is more restrained on the palate, complementing rather than swamping a dry, pithy-piney and earthy bitterness that speaks of England as much as, if not more than, the new world.\n",
      "Tap at Hole in The Wall (Raglan outside bar).    Dark brown almost black pour big frothy Guinness like head.  Nose is light earthy chocolate.  Tastes of light malt, rootbeer, roast and hint of dark chocolate.  Thin and dry.   I’m hungover so this is pleasant way to get back into life.\n",
      "Bottle from Cloudwater online. Deep and crystal clear amber colour. Aroma floral and spice nutmeg, cinnamon and citrus.  Taste sweet almost honey to slight sour.\n",

      "Cask at the Euston Tap, London on 6th February 2020. Hazy gold with shallow foam and scant lacing. Zesty citrus aroma. Grapefruit juice and citrus peel in liquid, and a tart citrus finish. Zingy mouthfeel and a fair amount of body.\n",
      "Botlle. Nose is malty,  dark fruit, plums, raisin. Taste is dark malts, dough, spice, hint of almond, roast, herbal hop not, touch of chocolate in the body with a bitter finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beautifully balanced.\n",
      "Bottle. Dark brown color with creamy beige head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee. Taste is chocolate, coffee, a little bit sour in the end. Silky mouthfeel, quite light, very low carbonation. I liked it, very easy to drink even if a bit too sweet, I would drink more.\n",
      "Keg @ Northern Monk Refectory, Manchester.  Bumped into Rune and Finn for a sample of this one so thanks to them.  Very dark, feeling about 4% lower than it is in my opinion, making it dangerous tasty, and there's a smoothness to the brew too.\n",
      "750-ml caged and corked bottle purchased at the brewery in Brossard, Quebec, Canada. Pours pitch black yet with the tiniest bit of mahogany hightlights, along with a trace of brown head and lots of clingy lacing. Aroma: coffee, chocolate, dark dried fruits, smoke. Flavor: espresso, milk chocolate, campfire marshmallows, prunes, raisin bread, date bars, figs, molasses cookies, burnt toast; perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel: full-bodied with a velvety smooth, creamy yet oily finish.\n",
      "A nice real ale cask served, but this one is a bit oxidized and stale. GBBF Winter2020\n",
      "Clear rich golden with a thick rocky white head. Nice aroma of sticky dank earthy pineapple and a little piney resin. Crisp bright golden malty flavor with nice pineapple and resiny aromas with little bitterness. Smooth and balanced and quaffable.\n",
      "Cask @ Fox & Goose, Hebden Bridge.  Light golden with a small head.  Hoppy ale with a brooding fruitiness somewhere in the background, and some malty-bitterness in its aftertaste.\n",
      "On Tap at the Boise brewery/taproom.  Hazy deep orange light amber with a thin wispy soapy of white head.  Some deep resinous piney hops in the aromas and flavors. Big citrus pithiness as well.  Late light malty cereal flavors.   Medium bodies and a little ABV burn in there.\n",
      "Pours a cloudy, pale golden amber coloration with a small, fluffy head and plenty of tiny particulates suspended in the beer. Smells of quite sweet doughy, biscuity malt and rather floral, grassy hops. Taste follows the nose, being rather dominated by sweet, doughy malt and quite floral, grassy hops, with just a hint of herbal and spicy accents also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium bitterness and some floral, grassy hops lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being quite impressed with everything I've had from Kundmüller before, this came as a bit of a disappointment to me, to be honest. I guess they wanted tro experiment with a dry-hopped Doppelbock and it's just not working for me because it's overly dominated by the quite floral and grassy hops, while the malts add little but sweetness here, that is at least somewhat balanced by the rather distinct bitterness though. Certainly a very different, unique Doppelbock that is very hoppy for the style, but not in a good way, and feels somewhat one-dimensional as well.\n",
      "500ml bottle.  Pours jet black with a large head.  Aroma is cinnamon and ginger.  Taste is sweet with honey to start with ginger, cinnamon and roast on the finish.\n",
      "Can from To Øl beer club. Hazy orange colour with a white head. Aroma tropical fruity guava and passion fruit. Tart fruity to sweet. Full smooth\n",
      "Clean classic old English porter, light I’m body, nothing off, clean and mildly roasty. Gbbf 2020\n",
      "Can, 7.2%. Hazy yellow with medium off-white head. Aroma is fruit, hops, citrus, pineapple and tropical fruit. Flavour is malt, fruit, hops, citrus, pineapple, sweet, juice, fruit peel and a little bitter.\n",
      "Draught. Pours opaque jet black with a medium, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate rich chocolate, toffee, and caramel malt, sweet cinnamon and vanilla, tobacco notes, dark fruits, and a sweet finish. Full body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "This \"Black Weizenbock\" certainly lives up to its name, being a lot more malt-focussed than your average Weizenbock, with some lightly roasted, caramel, chocolate and dark fruit notes coming through apart from the typical yeast esters. However, there's also a light tartness to this that seems somewhat displaced here. While the balance seems a little off, this still makes for quite an interesting and enjoyable brew at the end of the day. I would have wished for some stronger roasted notes and could have done without that light tartness though, which I'm not sure is really intended here. Almost seems just a tad oxidized, even though this should be reasonably fresh assuming a one-year best-by date.\n",

      "473ml can. Hazy, light yellow-ish, bright golden colour with average, thick, frothy to creamy, moderately lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Piney and juicy fruity, hoppy aroma, notes of pineapple, honeydew melon, spruce, some resin. Taste is juicy, (citrusy) fruity hoppy, notes of orange, mandarine, pineapple, some passion fruit, some pine, rather sugary, sweet, pale malty basis. Slightly watery texture, smooth and soft palate, gentle carbonation. Highly drinkable, refreshing, a tad too sugary sweet.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with light lacing. Moderate rich coffee, chocolate notes, light biscuit malt, and a dry finish. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "Bottle 33cl. @home poured into a teku glass. Opaque dark brown, tall creamy macropore tan head, good retention and lacing. Complex aroma roasted malt, liquorice, cherries, raisins, cocoa, wood, herbs, vanille kicks in after a while. Taste light heavy sweet and medium bitter, roasty, chocolate, cherries, raisins, alcohol, herbal notes. Full-bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, roasty sweetbitter aftertaste, alcohol, very good heavy but well-balanced and tasty, a real sipper.\n",
      "355ml bottle.  Pours dark gold with a large head.  Aroma is straw, lemon and biscuit.  Taste has straw, biscuit and soapy lemon.  An imported Apa that could be any generic UK supermarket gold.\n",
      "Handpull cask at the Beer Pharmacie, Syston. Light copper, translucent, with a good-sized off-white head on top. Aroma is malt-dominated, with an earthy breadiness. The initial sweet, malty taste turns to a leafy hop bitter almost immediately, with notes of redcurrants in the aftertaste. Soft carbonation. A basic but enjoyable basic bitter.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy yellow with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Medium acidity and tartness, lime, tamarind, and chili peppers, light cracker malt, and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "Bottle from Cloudwater. Abv 7%. Purple to red colour with no real head. Aroma blueberry taste tangy sour. Light body.\n",
      "On tap at Big Dog's, I assume the pom in the name refers to pomegranate as this had a nice light fruit flavor. Definitely didn't see the 9%.  I liked this quite a bit, but I have a bias towards pomegranate beer.\n",
      "Keg at the brewery taproom - Bermondsey. Pours black-brown with a frothy, beige head. Rich and ashy roast defines the character, with mellow sweetness supporting, some coffee grounds, scorched earth, toasted pine and orange peel. Medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Great balance in the finish. Excellent beer.\n",
      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours black-brown with a foamy, beige head. Luxurious and delicious, with lots of layered chocolate character, a bit of chocolate sauce, ripening dark fruits, subtle roast, creamy-sugary coffee. Full bodied, oily and lightly chewy, with fine carbonation. Softly warming finish, almost a little sticky, more more decadent chocolate character, raisins, mellow earthy bitterness, more dense fresh coffee. Has an obscene amount of depth. Makes for a great sipper. Delicious.\n",
      "On tap at Big Dog's, this was super sweet. The sugar was just off the charts. A bit creamy but just too sweet to enjoy.  A rare miss for Able Baker, imo.\n",
      "Keg at the Beer Pharmacie, Syston. Dark brown with a ring of khaki/tan head. Milk chocokate, a tpuch of cola nut in the aroma, with less of the advertised salted caramel than I expected although it's still a component. Tastes sweet with toffee notes to the fore, followed by a light hop bitterness in the finish. Liquorice in the aftertaste along with more chocolate and caramel. Light carbonation. While not the most focused beer, it certainly has a pleasant composition.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A very dark brown beer with a beige head. Aroma of bourbon, rum Barrel, dark roasted malt. Taste of dark roasted malt, coffee, burned malt rum barrel.\n",

      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL., and nitro dispensed as a 5 oz. serving showing a cascading effect to the darkest brown color, with some ruby highlighting, a silky layer of tan froth, and spiraling cling to the sheeting lacing. The nose was initially mild, but gradually presented cocoa, slight treacle, cream, sweetness, vanilla, and subtle spices as cinnamon & ginger. Medium bodied, the taste was as the aroma, with the nitro influence fading to nil, but still quite flavorful without the carbonation.\n",

      "Pours oily black with a creamy tan head. Strong aroma of firewood, dark malts, plum, but mostly smoke. Taste is sweet, roasted malts, again very smoky. Medium body, low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel.\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. as a 5 oz. serving showing a black/brown hue, with a presentable layer of deep tan froth that reduced to a persistent ring, and foamy dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was roasted, cocoa, char & dryness, with a touch of mint. Medium+ bodied, with fair to low carbonation, the taste was similar, syrupy, including roasted and earthy bitterness, and the slight mint that actually took the edge off the astringency.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy deep copper color with a medium sized frothy head. Aroma of ripe banana. Medium sour taste. Flavors are bread and banana. Medium to full body.\n",

      "Opaque colour, good brownish head. Roasted aroma has coffee, cacao and dark chocolate. Full-bodied. Roasted flavour has lots of espresso, cacao, ash. Not really chillies here. Smooth, hides ABV well. Quite dry, almost too dry.\n",
      "Puszka. Mętne o brudnym ,żółtym kolorze. Piana biała ,średnia szybko opadła do pierścienia. W aromacie mix tropików,mango,ananas,morele,cytrusy raczej słodkie ,pozostają w tle. W smaku nadal słodko ,mango ,morele ,ananas,liczi ,żółty melon. Jest też nutka cytrusów,różowy grejpfrut ..guma balonowa? Wysycenie małe i  zdradliwe 8 procent...\n",
      "Kolor bursztynowy, opalizujący. W płynie widać drożdżowe drobiny. Piana biała, wysoka i trwała. Zbudowana z drobnych pęcherzyków.\n",
      "W aromacie nuty pieprzowe, estry owocowe sporo słodyczy. Słodowość, miód, syrop owocowy, suszone owoce, beczka i odrobina nut waniliowych.\n",
      "Smak: syrop owocowy, suszone owoce, słodka słodowość i akcenty przyprawowe z pieprzem na czele. Dalej beczka, mokre drewno, i bardzo delikatnie wanilia. Na finiszu goryczka, pestkowa.\n",
      "Alkohol idealnie ukryty. Wysycenie wysokie, cały czas buzuje w ustach. Ciało wysokie. Piwo jest nieco szorskie.\n",
      "Pours a deep dark brown almost black colour with a small frothy light beige head. Aroma is sweet roasted malts and milk chocolate with a hint of dried fruit. A moderately sweet smooth roasted malt taste, cocoa powder and burnt malt flavours with a dry slightly alkaline finish. Nice.\n",

      "Аромат жжёной карамели\n",
      "Вкус очень приятный, шоколад - хлебная корка - карамель. Отличный портер.\n",
      "Keg at Micro Beers, Sheen.  Super dark brown with a thick tan head.  Aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa, slight astringent grain and rum.  Very smooth and quite a big date and dark fruit flavour with some vanilla and cocoa.\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. as a 5 oz. serving showing a clear, deep amber color, with a fluffy layer of tan froth, and sheeting spray as lacing. The nose was expressive dried fruit, cherry & skins, candy sweetness, barrel induced vanilla, and subtle spice. Medium bodied, with fair carbonation, the booze and barrel added decent warmth & astringency, but lessened the lively follow through of the aroma notes. Still got the job done as a presentable winter warmer.\n",
      "I can't say enough about this 4%, 100 calorie IPA. Obviously it is lighter by definition. But they've crafted it to be surprisingly flavorful and refreshing. It's gotta be a winner for folks that may be averse to traditional IPA bitterness. Very drinkable and the low calories are an added bonus.\n",
      "Cask at MS HW, 06/02/20.\n",

      "Passable for the sub genre ... nothing I’d go back to though.\n",
      "Top notch sour, balanced and drinkable. Fruity yet not overly so, and tartness that is world class. GBBF Winter\n",
      "Im Geruch malzig süßlich. Goldgelbes klares Bier, schnell einfallende grobe Schaumkrone. Der Antrunk ist süßlich hopfig-malzig. Traditioneller Hopfen im Aroma. Sehr mild, kaum bitter. Leichte Säure. Feinperlig. Relativ eintönig, leistet sich jedoch keine geschmacklichen Fehler. Besser als das typische Durchschnitts-Export.\n",

      "Pours a clear dark brown colour with a small bubbly light beige colour that settled. A rich creamy aroma,  sweet vanilla and toffee fudge. Not overly sweet, smooth and creamy in the mouth, roasted malt, creamy with vanilla flavours and a dryish finish. Quite tasty.\n",
      "niesamowite są te chmiele nowozelandzkie, pachnie to jak kwiaciarnia, prawdziwy gewurztraminer wśród ipek - dla mnie bomba, i to w prawie trzymiesięcznej puszce - zero utlenienia.\n",
      "A lovely beer to drink.The bottle of Copper Dragon Golden Pippin was was purchased at Booths @ Lytham. Recommend 😉\n",
      "Medium, rather dense just off-white head over finely carbonated totally clear golden beer. Very nice nose, dominated by fruitacids and -esters, bit floral. Peaches are utterly obvious, vinous arrives a bit later. Superbly inviting. Sour, lambic-like barnyard odours. In the taste, the fruitiness is more subdued, but still quite traceable. Faint notes of sulphur, stressing the lambic-likeness even more. Outstanding! Another one Martin T has pointed us to in his book, and with good reason!\n",

      "Brown with a foamy head that soon turns whispy. Big medicinal aroma, a cherry/raspberry blend cough syrup. Herbal too though. With a bit of time out of the bottle it really does start to smell like a PB&J. The intense peanuty note is probably the highlight of this brew. Taste is bittersweet, full of earthy peanut shell and sweet artificial cough drop. Body is medium, carbonation moderate, texture watery. Probably the most disappointing tough 50 brew I‘ve tried, at least for such a major style.\n",

      "December 14th, 2015 - The smell of Christmas hangs heavy over this hazy, cinnamon colored beer. Vanilla and custard tease rich desserts, while cinnamon and clove give the scent it's holiday cheer. The flavor is weaker than the aroma, with an odd tanginess, but I do find comfort in the brusque, rye focused aftertaste.\n",

      "A clear amber colour with a coppery tint and a thin off white head that quickly disappeared. Aroma is toffee malts with herbal hop notes. Not a  lot of sweetness, a bitter slightly astringent taste, with some underlying malt flavours. A robust drying bitterness in the finish. The more I drink the more I like it.\n",

Imperial Stout de manual, con un cuerpo que da miedo y con un punto quemado que le da mucho carácter, sólida.\n",

      "Pours black with a small tan head. The aroma is of roast malt, coffee, and bourbon. The flavor has a pretty balanced bourbon taste that goes well with the roast malt, coffee, and chocolate. Full body. Very good.\n",
      "[Vintage - 2019]\n",
      "Aroma: Rich dark fruits, dates, raisins, caramel and bourbon\n",
      "Appearance: Amber brown with a small short-lasting head\n",
      "Taste: Moderate sweet and bitter, caramel and dark dried fruits including dates, plums and raisins\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Oily texture with soft carbonation\n",
      "Overall: Impressive complex taste :)\n",
      "This amber brew smells of toasted caramel malt. It has a pretty assertive flavor the style with the caramel joined by a good hops bite. It's still easy drinking and overall is an enjoyable brew.\n",
      "On tap at Burns Family poured a clear yellow with a lasting creamy white head. Aromas of straw, nuttiness, light apple and light yeast. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry tart finish. Flavors of straw, apples, light nuttiness and light citrus with a crisp dry tart lingering apple finish.\n",

      "pours dark brown with a small smooth soon disappearing light brown to brown head.\n",
      "Mild malty aroma with some subtle notes resembling brown cakes. fairly complex spicy thing going on with the browncakes.\n",
      "flavor is sort of like browncakes, also fainter roasted malts. ever so slightly flowery or citrussy too, could be hops.\n",
      "a bit boring , i think a heavier load of roasted malts would improve on things. comes off as slighlty thin and somewhat boring. Of course, done this way, you get more of the notes from the wood, which is what is special about this beer in the first place.\n",
      "reminds me of english low abv stout in general, so if you're into that, then this one is not bad at all.\n",
      "Underlying beer is nice and smooth and creamy, a bit of oxidation though. But the mild roast is nice. GBBF Winter\n",
      "Bottle poured a clear reddish amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of caramel, carrots and nuttiness. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of caramel, nuttiness and carrots with a crisp dry lingering carrot cake finish.\n",
      "On tap.  It poured a cloudy orange color with a white head.  The aroma was of citrus, hops and florals.  The taste was similar to the aroma with more citrus, hops, florals, pine, malts with medium carbonation and a nice bitter sweet aftertaste.  Good stuff.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Svart. Lysebrunt luftig filmskum. Aroma av sjokolade. Smaken lakris & melkesjokolade. Tørr avslutning.\n",
      "16 oz. can poured a clear dark reddish brown with a lingering ring of tan foam. Aromas of coffee, pecans, roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt and pecans with a smooth dry lingering chocolate pecan finish.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 3.5%. Near-opaque yellow. Small, swiftly-disappearing head. Faint bready tangerine aroma. Moderate- carbonation. Very light grapefruit notes and a hint of passion fruit.  Rather nondescript malt lurking. There could perhaps even be a splash of the alleged tangerine in there, but the most prominent flavour is a plain hop tartness. Possibly Simcoe? Somewhat puts me in mind of Cloudwater's Simcoe + Green Tea soda...I daren't say more. Not bad for the ABV, and even something of a grower,  but a bit light for my tastes. Still, that's what it's going for, so i can't really knock this. Would be great on a sunny day - which it is.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Ultramørk amber /svart. Skumring med litt farge. Lett krydderaroma. Smaken sjokolade med litt krydder i bakgrunnen. Lett tørr avslutning.\n",
      "On tap.  It poured a black color with a tan head. The aroma was of  coffee, chocolate and malts. The taste was similar to the aroma with more coffee, chocolate, malts, some raisins with mild carbonation and a nice chewy aftertaste.  Not bad.\n",
      "16 oz. can poured a murky gold with a small lasting creamy white head. Aromas of straw, yeast, fruitiness, citrus and pine. Palate was light bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of straw, yeast, citrus, dankness and pine with a smooth dry bitter lingering dank finish.\n",

      "Cask at The Coach & Horses, Rickmansworth on 12/11/2007.  Not quite as bad as expected, but goes to show how much things have changed.  People wouldn’t touch this beer at the time, due to its “crazy” strength.  Seems pretty tame now.  Not really sure whether this wasn’t just Abbot ale with some extra brewing sugar thrown in to up the alcohol content.\n",

      "Cask at By the Horns Brewery, Summerstown.  A light golden bitter.  These Bullian hops are a little spicy and savoury, which gives the beer a fairly unusual flavour.  I just think it’s a bit too weak a beer to properly balance out the hop flavours.\n",

      "Tap @Yard Bar Bangkok. Golden colour not completely clear, high whitehead. Aroma of tropical fruits and some floral. Taste yeasty, apricot, passionfruit, soft piney finish. Mouthfeel is yeasty tecture to me. Light body.\n",
      "05-02-20 // 500ml bottle at Baron, Mainz. Pours unfiltered golden with a solid hwite head. Grainy sweet. Light Ale character with a big thicker body than when expecting a bavarian Helles. Sort of an hybrid between Helles and Golden Ale? Grainy smooth.\n",
      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live!  2019 version. 6,5%. 12 Monate gerefit. Rich malty with solid mild whiskey notes. Caramel malty sweetness. Mild vanilla.\n",
      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live! Schon gut. Chocolate cherry, Schwarzwald gateau vibes without being too sweet. More of a darker bitter chocolate aroma. Good.\n",
      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live! Unclear golden. Wheat malts and wheaty yeast aromas along a floral aroma. Average.\n",
      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live! From a bottle. Pours unclear pinkish red. Distinct cider yeast aromas in the nose along a raspberry aroma. Good fruity sourness and well embedded yeast aromas.\n",
      "I have purchased this beer, at Wittisch Getränk market, at Olten. Drinking and enjoying this bottle yesterday after the birthday of my daughter. The body is copper/brown and a bit troubled, average carbonation, a bit crispy, white foam. In my point of view, it is an interesting ipa, you have probably a touch of citra, mineral, hay, side of tobacco, touch of lychee, fruity and dry, malt, hoppy and citrus.\n",
      "375 mL bottle. Pours yellow and a little hazy. Smells of, amazingly, pilsner malt right up front. White wine behind it, and very sauvignon blanc-y. Tastes of sharp white wine acidity. Oak. Pilsner malt is still there, but lost to acidity and white wine. Medium body. The layers are a little muddled on the palate, at least by comparison to how discrete they are on the nose.\n",
      "Nice deep brown color to it with some reddish highlights, pours with three fingers of light brown colored, rocky looking head that has a good retention to it that leaves a nice skim on the surface of the glass, leaves no lacing but has some slight legs running down the sides. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fairly sweet aroma to it of dark fruits and syrup with hints of spices and brandy that give a slight fruitcake impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forward is fairly malty and quite sweet, medium/ heavy bodied with a slightly above average amount of carbonation to it and a nice toffee flavor to it with a solid mouthfeel, as well as a light fruity reduced grape note almost a bit like ice wine with faint hints of honey, dates and, trace of plum and rum raisin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Back end has spicy hints of black pepper, cayenne and cloves as well as a lightly leafy, tobacco hop note and a sweet brandy finish with a whisper of heat to it leaving a lingering sweet toffee, raisin and tobacco aftertaste to it and a slight boozy warmth spreading out to the limbs.\n",
      "500 mL bottle. Pours clear and very pale yellow. Smells of soft doughy malt and light spicy hop. Tastes of bready and lightly sweet dough. Light spicy hops throughout but I keep expecting it to peak with a spicy bite, but never does. Very light. It hints a hefty hop back end it but drops off in favor of a delicate malt flavor.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 4.3%. Sheer pastel orange with a picturesque head, decent duration. Orange juice aromas with some mango undertones and perhaps a hint of grapefruit. Lowish carbonation. Primarily orange-juicy, helped by the mouthfeel, with a pale malt serving to add very slight, gentle pithiness. Some slight mango tropical tints too. Smooth, sweet, bland in a good way - it's a bit like vanilla - sure it's plain, but who doesn't like vanilla? Especially well done vanilla. This is well done vanilla. Classic easy-drinker with classic hops, and just has that touch of class in how it's all put together that makes this absolutely, evidently craft and not supermarket fare. Balance of bitter and sweet is spot on too. I've had a lot of craft Pales that didn't quite meet the mark set here in sheer execution. But still, it's vanilla. Don't expect the world and this will do right by your tastebuds.\n",

      "Dark, Clean, Tan Beerhead, with thin, frothy, and lacing foam. OK retention. Having hoppy flavors and roasted malts characters at the same time, great balance between them, and different performances from cold to ambient temperature. Like coffee, toffee, plums, dark caramel, and slightly vanilla hints on the tasting. On the other hand, grapefruit, pine and  tropical fruits in the smell.\n",
      "Aroma : Toasted caramel malts with a grassy hop undertone.  Taste : Toasted sweet caramel malts up front, balanced by soft bittering hop finish. Better than average Irish Red (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",

      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Amber with white head. Cannot believe I hadn't had this before but glad I came across it now. Full and hoppy in character, orange bitterness, peel and zest, citrusy, grapefruit juice flavours. Good depth of flavour, hides the ABV well. A cracker.\n",
      "Aroma : Notes of caramel & bready malt, citrus orange, grapefruit & some pine.  Taste : Lightly sweet caramel malt nicely balanced by bitter citrus. Not special but easily drinkable (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazy golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of mango, zesty hops, mild citrus and light cereal/grain. Similar flavor, adding mild bitterness and mild sweetness with a hint of cinnamon at the finish. Interesting.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Very dark brown with cream head. There are sour notes in this from the off, acidic lactose with soured plum flavours, damson notes. The darker roasted malts do come through, some nutty hints. Not sure about sour porter but this is fine.\n",
      "Light lemon colour with white head, typical lager profile with some minor spice on the nose. A crisp lager that’s easy to drink, not a fan of the herbal/spice thing through the palate\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There is a light fruitiness to this, malt lead, lightly grainy then tropical fruit hopped notes. Pineapple and Mango flavours. Easy on the palate. Pretty reasonable.\n",

      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There is a light fruitiness to this with  a pleasant fruity, dry hopped note. The ginger came through qute late for me but was more obvious for others on the table. Drying in the close. Pretty reasonable.\n",

      "Aroma : Light caramel malt, unusual sweet orange note rather than citrus orange.  Taste : Malt is sublte, sweet orange comes through and although not overpowring, for me lacks some bittering balance. Still an o.k. beer though (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",

      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Very dark brown with cream head. There is a sweetish fruity, plummy flavour to this from the off, rich and flavoursome on the palate. Lasting through the beer, hints of chocolate and liquorice. Very pleasant.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Very dark brown with beige head. There is a sweet fruitiness to this from the off becoming fairly tangy later. Some earthy roasted malt notes. Biggish on the palate. Reasonable.\n",
      "Cloudy dark gold pour with a one finger white head. Aroma of toast and tropical fruit, coconut, light caramel, sweet citrus. Flavor is mostly the same with some earthy floral and toasty sesame notes. Medium body, slick to syrupy feel, moderate hop acid bite. Pretty good.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Amber with white head. There is a light toffee caramel character to this from the start. Reasonably dry, malty with an earthy, twiggy hopped note. It's fine.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There is a honeyed note in the aroma which passes through into the beer, syrupy, slightly flabby in character. Thinnish bitterness late on. It's okay.\n",
      "Very dark red-brown, faint ruby highlights, mocha head. The aroma is dark malt sugars, not too sweet, lots of cooked corn upfront, a little alcohol. The dms goes away after a while, leaving room for more malts. The taste quite sweet and malty, dark caramel and maltose, with a touch of roast barley, some hop spice and warming alcohol. Not bad, despite the bucket loads of dms, not a stout... Otherwise a decent malț forward dark beer.\n",
      "Can bought at BCL in June 2019, $3.60 CAD.\n",

      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Pale gold with white head. This proved to be a malt lead beer, bitter and dry from the start, grainy cereal notes, quite earthy in flavour. Easy on the palate. It's fine.\n",
      "Black pour with a thin tan head. Aroma of Chai spice, toast, roasted nuts, Strawberry hard candy, light floral notes and Karo syrup. Flavor is gooey burnt cinnamon rolls, nondescript fruity notes, chocolate, dark caramel. Heavy body, syrupy, gloopy feel, light, sharp carbonation. Decent, lots of conflicting stuff going on, but it works.\n",
      "Bottle thanks to Mike J. Pours a pitch black hue with a small white head. A roast and cocoa nose, light wood. Rich, vanilla, very woody, tannins, sweet tobacco, dark fruit, light minerals, licorice, slick palate. Very nice.\n",
      "Cloudy, near black pour with a thin, creamy tan head. Aroma of Chai spice, lactose, chocolate, and light roast. Flavor is nutmeg heavyweight Chai, earth, walnut, a hint of cocoa and black tea. Medium body medium carbonation slightly syrupy, kinda gloopy feel. Pretty good, but it's all spice.\n",
      "Cloudy golden appearance with a fluffy white head. Aroma of juicy hops, fresh citrus, mild tropical notes and a light zesty spice. Similar flavor, adding mild to moderate hop bitterness and some juicy sweetness. Medium plus body with a smooth citrusy finish. Nice.\n",
      "Poured from a 500 ml bottle. \n",
      "Aroma is rather floral with light pepper and honey notes. Light grain notes and faint honey notes. \n",

      "Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, an odd beer but a somewhat enjoyable one as well. Nice floral notes with light elderberry and a bit of acidity.\n",

      "Cloudy burnt orange pour with a one finger creamy white head. Aroma of bread, berry, candied citrus, spruce and sharp mineral notes. Flavor is sweet citrus, bready malt, light toast and mineral notes. Light body, lightly chalky feel, light carbonation. Ok.\n",
      "Spritzy nose with some breadiness. Some estey notes as it warms up and breathes. Medium body with some sweetness and a moderate bitterness. Clean finish. Very drinkable, but nothing jumps out at me.\n",
      "Clear golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of toasted grain, mild strawberry and a light herbal spice. Similar flavor, grainy and fruity with mild sweetness and light bitterness. Light body with a slight watery feel and a lingering berry finish.\n",
      "Aroma is berries, apples and mild/medium sweetness.  The flavor is berries/slight soda, apples and a medium sweet finish.\n",
      "Poured from a 16 oz can. \n",

      "Pours a slightly hazy, brilliant gold color with a large, thick, frothy, white head that recedes slowly to a small film that lingers a bit on the edges. Moderately high lacing and no legs. \n",

      "Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, a pretty enjoyable lager. Nice malt notes with assertive bitterness and hop notes. Hop notes and bitterness are not too strong though and malt is still center stage.\n",
      "Clear golden appearance with a lingering white head. Aroma of zesty hops, toasted grain and light tropical notes. Similar flavor, adding mild to moderate bitterness and light sweetness. Light body with a slight watery finish.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with a medium, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate roast and coffee malt, light hop bitterness, dark fruits, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Hazy orange to pale amber pour with a one finger white head. Aroma of sweet juicy and candied citrus, light sweet bread, light pineapple-heavyweight tropical fruit. Flavor is citrus and floral up front some pine, a little pineapple and yeasty bread. Light to medium body, chalky, medium sharp carbonation. I like it, although it seems unnaturally sweet.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear amber with a medium, frothy off-white head, short retention leaving only a cordon. Moderate fruity and citrus hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium toast and biscuit malt, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear amber with a medium, frothy off-white head, long retention with good lacing. Moderate dank, earthy, and woody hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium toast malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy dark orange with a large, frothy white head, long retention with excellent lacing. Heavy fruity and floral hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium grainy and bready malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",

      "Draught. Pours clear dark gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with good lacing. Medium rich bready malt, sulfur notes, medium floral and spicy hops, medium hop bitterness, and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "473ml can. Pours a hazy copper with a medium, creamy, short lived, tan head that laces nicely. Aroma of bready wheat malt, banana, clove and yeast. Sweet flavour of toasted bready wheat malt, caramel, clove, fig, yeast and a hint of nuts in a dry, mild bitter finish. Medium body with a smooth, oily texture and average carbonation. Malt forward and tasty. Pretty solid.\n",
      "Apparence : Dorée, claire, col blanc moyen bien aéré, carbonatation moyenne.    \n",
      "Nez : Malt, pain frais.  \n",
      "Goût : Malt et pain accompagnés d'un houblon qui tangue entre les notes feuillues et celles d'agrumes. Peu sucrée, amertume douce.   \n",
      "Sensation : Mince, effervescence moyenne, arrière-goût associé au houblon décrit plus haut.   \n",
      "Bref : Peut-être un problème de fraîcheur, mais ni le malt ni le houblon (ni leur agencement, il va sans dire) ne me convainc ici. Dans les bières douces et faciles à boire, je conseillerais probablement d'autres avant celle-ci.\n",

      "Pours thick black with thin, tan head. Aroma is coconut, cocoa, vanilla and roast. Taste is chocolate and lactose, moving to coconut, vanilla and roast. Finish is chocolate, coconut, vanilla and roast. Tasty stout.\n",
      "Hazy orange with a white head. Aroma is juicy with tropical fruit, mango, melon, pineapple. Medium bodied, juicy, quaffable, nice hazy.\n",
      "Cloudy pale orange pour with a two finger creamy white head that has good retention. Aroma of toast, sesame, sweet citrus and light Mango and guava. Flavor is mostly the same with a little cat box and pine. Light to medium body slightly chalky feel, light carbonation. Pretty good\n",
      "A big New England style IPA, brewed with Mosaic, New Zealand Cascade, Gringeist, and Barbe Rouge.  Let's hear it for hops no one has heard of before.  The pretty label has lots of flowers on it.  Flavorful and complex - pine, marmalade, and pineapple.  It is not too fruity tho, with earthy notes, oregano, and blue Gatorade.  Pleasant but not too strong in the nostrils.  Another good IPA from TH.\n",
      "Can from the LCBO that pours a clean, dark amber colour with a frothy light beige head, good stay and some spotted foam lace is left. Caramel malt aromas with some dark fruit notes, nuttiness and mild hops. These hops show a little more in the taste, blended with the caramel base and some roasted malts. Fairly hoppy-bitterness for a lager, especially a dark one. Again, some dark fruits and hints of molasses. Quite decent for the style.\n",
      "Can from Bottles in Providence, RI.  Bright amber-gold with a thin, coarse white head and fairly poor retention.  Nothing left after a minute or so.  Aroma is a nice lightly lager-sour and grainy lager smell.  a touch musty and a touch copper metallic (in a pleasant way), corn.  Body is medium-medium-light weight, syrupy, with medium-medium-light carbonation and burn, fairly fine on the palate, velvety.  Flavor is pretty robust, lightly lager-sour, getting very faint hints of spices, a bit of grain and light sweetness with some metallic grass notes too.  Aroma is very nice here, the taste is fine.  Better than I was expecting!\n",
      "So I have no idea what hibiscus tastes like, so I don't know if I'm getting any, but this beer is bone dry with a bit of spice and some barnyard, which is what I expect from a saison.\n",
      "Pours a mostly clear yellow color with a thick off white head. The aroma is pickle juice and some tartness. The flavor is overpowering sour pickle juice. There is some tartness and saltiness in there as well. Very much a gimmick beer and worth a try.\n",
      "Aroma is cranberries/orange and almost fruit wine.  The flavor is fruit/orange/cranberries, malts a puckering tart/very dry finish.\n",
      "From can to pint glass.  Aromas of citrus and lemon.  Slight grainy malt.  Crystal clear pale yellow with sustained, small white head.  Beautiful beer.  Flavor is lemon cake and slight curd.  Dry finish, follows through to a nice carbonic bite.  Very good beer.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with brown highlights and a medium, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate rich chocolate and coffee, light nuttiness, and a medium dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear dark brown with a medium, frothy off-white head, short retention. Medium rich toasted bread malt, cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa with a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",

      "Clear, bright yellow with a 2-finger near white head and good lacing. \n",

      "This has a distinctive hopping that is nothing like anything I’ve experienced before. I welcome the addition to the brewmaster’s pallet, but I find this beer is a little too grapey for my taste.\n",
      "Can part of mixer I bought for family. Fine brown pour. Tastes earthy, caramel, nuts, malt. Thinner\n",
      "Real dark brown colour with a little copper highlights. The head is mocha-coloured with bubble around the rim and little spotted lacing. Cocoa powder aromas blended with coconut and other chocolate notes. The taste is pretty rich, but not too thick, so goes down nicely. Roasted, chocolate malts with coffee hints. Fairly dry finish, bitterness lingering a bit with a tad peanut butter. Even though not as sweet dessert as their other 10% ABV Imperial Sweet Stouts, still loaded with beautiful ingredients. Starting to feel the peanut butter more and more, which seems to be what is blending things.\n",

      "Draught. Pours clear gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Moderate orange and melon hops, medium hop bitterness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Hazy straw body with a thin head. Aroma is lemon zest, orange and grapefruit. Bright and with a zing. Taste is lighter, with orange and lemon zest bitter/sweet mixture. Texture is thin.\n",
      "Cloudy pale gold pour with a one finger white head. Aroma is very lemony and tart floral. Flavor is juicy lemon-lime citrus, straw, pale malt, wildflower. Light body, dry feel light carbonation. Good stuff, interesting hop profile.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy dark amber with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Moderate orange and fruit hops, honeydew and cantaloupe notes, light bread malt, medium hop bitterness and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Juicy nose with notes of mango, mandarin, navel orange, pineapple, some more musky floral tropical fruit, fresh leaves and grass, a bit of biscuit malt. Flavour is rather sweet up front, with orange, mango and pineapple again in the lead, a fairly neutral but present biscuit grain base, some moderately green grassy hops and citrus peels and a hint of onion enter in the semi-juicy but drying finish with light to moderate bitterness. Medium bodied, average carbonation, a little creamy. A nicely executed NEIPA, would have liked a little less greenness late in the sip but I enjoy getting this with some regularity.\n",
      "16 ounce can. Murky mustard gold color. Two finger high frothy beige head. Nice clinging lace. Floral hop nose hints at honeysuckle and sweet citrus. Crackery malt base has a jolt of dank citrus hop flavor. Subtle creamy mouthfeel from the wheat and oats. Bitter peppery finish.\n",
      "relatively fresh can that pours clear bright gold with a large white head offering good retention and lacing. golden doughy pilsner malts twirling with soft tropical citra, but also peppery and spicy herbal notes surprisingly, super clean yeast action. moderate carbonation, light body - oily; dry citrusy-herbal finish. meant to write noble hops or gtfo, but eh, this is a great new world pilsner.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with good lacing. Moderate orange and dank hops and hop bitterness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "341mL can, pours a hazy golden with a medium white head. Aroma reveals bright floral hops, with some citrus zest, and biscuity malt. Flavour is balanced, with citrus hops, some floral notes, and crisp biscuity malt. Nothing overly interesting, but the balance is good, and there is even a decent hop bite. Better than expected.\n",
      "Hazy golden colour with a tad orange, a warm cap, average retention and some spotted lace. Orange citrus scent with lots of fruity sweetness, tropical fruits like papaya and even hints of peach. Very smooth and silky mouthfeel. The grassiness is well-hidden from the hops in the taste, with some peppery light notes. The fruitiness does the rest. This is very, very drinkable, very good. Should be one they can, and have all of the time as their standard IPA.\n",
      "(473ml can from L'Axe du Malt, Quebec City) Pours nearly opauqe yellow-orange with an average white head. Aroma of green mango, melon, papaya, unripe guava, some sweet canned peach and orange undertones, a little leafy. Flavour is off-dry with melon, papaya and green mango most prevalent, some estery kveik fruitiness, light biscuit to the malt, finishing rather dry with quite low bitterness, a little chalky, with lingering melon and fruit peels. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Solid effort, I'd like more expression of the citra here which teases juicy but ends up a bit more on the greener side.\n",
      "(473ml can from L'Axe du Malt, Quebec City) Pours opaque dingy orange juice with a tight white cap with stability and lace. Aroma of sweet tangerine, dried mango, citrus peels, leafy hops, dank and rather green onion-y, some sweetness. Flavour is semi-sweet up front but with a lot of citrus bitters, leafy greens, melon peels competing with the tropical fruit notes. Finishes bone dry and resinous with a moderate plus bitter bite for style. Light to medium body with soft fairly smooth carbonation. Solid NEIPA but the balance is too far towards the green side for me to truly love this.\n",
      "(473ml can from Metro St Roch, Quebec City) Pours nearly clear pale gold with a rapidly fizzing head. Simple clean semi-dry cider, fresh lightly sweet and lightly tart Mcintosh apple vibes, slight skin and yeast tones, pretty mineral, dry finish. Light fizzing mouthfeel. Decent enough, bought for cooking and not objectionable to drink half the can.\n",
      "500ml bottle at home via VA.  Hazy golden orange with a lasting white head and good lacing.  Funky peach, apricot, earth, yeast, mild vinegar and brett.  Medium carb and body, creamy champagne texture.  Lingering funky finish.  Delicious.\n",
      "orange with white head. alcohol. and alcohol. grain. taste is hot and balanced, tons of just sugar. not bad at all, but a beer with one obvious purpose. wouldnt get again unless i wanted to get drunk and it was placed in front of me\n",

      "22 oz bomber stamped rel# 55 abv 6.6.  Pours clear golden with foamy white head.  Medium body.  Floral aroma including rosemary and thyme.  Bready and very herbal taste.  Bitter finish.\n",
      "Pours a hazy, lemon-gold, with smallish head. Aroma has some straw, some dank, stinky cheese. Flavor has straw, citrus, some tropical fruit. A touch chalky. Finish is rather bitter.\n",
      "Cloudy orange-gold pour with a two finger frothy, off-white head that has great retention. Aroma of citrus, tart and fruity floral and juicy tropical fruit. Flavor is juicy tropical fruit, juicy citrus, a little pale malt, nice fruity esters. Medium body creamy feel, light, blanketing carbonation, just a hint of hop acid bite. Really good.\n",
      "Light yellow appearance with mild haze and a white head. Aroma of zesty hops, toasted grain and light pineapple. Similar flavor, adding mild hop bitterness and light sweetness. Light and crisp with a refreshing finish. Solid.\n",

      "Pencil shavings and orange peel nose. Hazy amber, firm medium head. Clementine, tangerine. Medium body, easy carbonation.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Niemuth's, 2/5/20. Hazy pale gold, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of mango, apricot, leafy hops, pale malt. Taste is pale malt, tropical fruit, a bit of pine. Medium bodied, low bitterness. Indeed crushable. Solid.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, long retention with light lacing. Moderate fresh grassy and herbal hops, medium bread malt, funky Brettanomyces, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "can.  Poured opaque brown with a beige head. Aroma of sweet candied nuts. Full rich mouthfeel, creamy carbonation, long finish.  Flavour is savory and sweet, almost sickly, nutty and caramel notes, roasty malts. Not bad, but one was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a large, creamy white head, long retention with good lacing. Moderate lime and orange, medium tartness and acidity, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "12 ounce with no bottling date, served at the Hyatt Place bar in Roanoke, VA. Clear orange pour with a film of cream. Nose of honey, orange, toast and a touch of lemon grass. Flavors of orange, toffee, lemon grass and a touch of resin. Smooth, near-medium mouthfeel. Nice, easy drinking balance without much bitterness.\n",
      "Pours a hazy dark amber from a can, thick white head. Tropical and stone fruit aroma and flavor, nondescript and sweet. Juicy. Good beer.\n",
      "I guess I forgot to score this. Couldn't make up my mind what to drink and figured this wasn't getting any better. Deep mahogany color with a mall tan head. Aroma of dark sugars, caramel, wood, oak, vanilla, light chocolate. Full bodied, warming, no oxidation even after 4+ years, great sipper.\n",
      "Aroma is citrus, banana esters and fresh bread. Taste is light sweet grains, honey, coriander, and clove. Pretty standard expression here.\n",
      "Pours inky black like motor oil. Little carb. Big alcoholic nose of toffee, chocolate and tobacco. Flavor is so rich with bourbon and chocolate with a bit of espresso in the back ground coats your mouth and throat in a good way. Decadent beer well worth trying.\n",

      "12 ounce bottle thanks to hershiser2! Hazy amber, large white head, decent retention. Aroma of bready malt, toasted grain, apricot, spice, yeast, marzipan. Taste is spice, hay, cherry, apricot, yeast. Medium bodied, mild lingering spice. A bit on the sweet side but pretty nice.\n",
      "Bottle. Pours lightly hazy reddish orange and nearly still. Moderate tart and acidic citrus, medium earthy rosemary, vinous red grapes, earthy, and a dry finish. Medium body and nearly still.\n",
      "Can. Clear golden. Aroma of apples. Medium sweet, lightly tart. Medium bodied and a little dry.\n",
      "Looks great with a dark brown body and a tan head. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate. Taste is bitter cocoa and burnt malt. Coffee too. Texture is thin.\n",
      "Lactic tartness, some funk, heavy peach notes. Bone dry, no residual sugars here. Good beer.\n",
      "From explosivedog, thanks: pours blackish with a ruby tinge with a beige head. Aroma is loads of roasted coffee beans, hints of vanilla, chocolate. Taste is sweet, loads of coffee, low bitter. Silky and creamy body, but still quite light. Tasty.\n",
      "Bottle with much love to Scott, the facilitator of all good things.  Pours a deep, dark brown (thin looking liquid though) with a thin head.  Aromas of leather, charcoal, and coffee.  Flavor is a nice and clean stout with a touch of bourbon, coffee, and smoky charcoal.  Nice and light for a beer with this much flavor.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear dark gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Medium tart citrus, light acidity, medium bread malt, vinous character, oak, and a dry finish. Medium body and light carbonation.\n",
      "Absolutely delicious. The hoppiness of Torpedo is toned down, but the results are oh so fascinating once this subdued IPA bitterness is coupled with generous barrel aging. The bourbon notes provide a lovely baseline, while subtle grapefruit, orange, and pine notes play off the vanilla and wood from the barrel. Texture's dreamy in its supple smooth feel; ABV's a nonfactor. Just a frickin' amazing beer.\n",

      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a small, frothy white head, short retention. Medium tart and acidic citrus, white grapes and vinous, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and light carbonation.\n",
      "Can. Clear golden with whitish colored bubbles. Aroma of honey, apples, and a little agave. Sweet with a hint of tart. Medium bodied with a touch of fizz on the tongue. Well done.\n",
      "Cask. Pours clear golden orange with a bubbly white head, short retention. Moderate savory bergamot flowers, oregano, light tartness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and light carbonation.\n",
      "330 ml bottle from the LCBO.  Pours a dark mahogany colour with smallish cream-coloured head.  Aroma is dark cherry with solid oakiness, sourness, toffee and grains.  Flavour has tart dark cherry, moderate oakiness, a little vinegar and toffee.  Medium plus bodied.  Nice.\n",
      "On tap at Champps in Brookfield. 2019 version! Very dark brown pour. Aroma has sweet barrel, cinnamon, some chiles, sweet malts. Taste is of cinnamon, sweet barrel, cherry, sweet malts, and tangy chiles. Well done and tasty. The chiles provide a solid heat. Medium to full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is good. This does not have the typical Darkness full body, but still solidly supports the barrel & chiles. Unsure how this would age. Lovin the cinnamon/barrel taste blend. Finishes sweetly, with barrel & cinnamon. This has an interesting blend. Multi dimensional with the chiles. Still would like more of the typical Darkness thickness. 16.3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On tap at Champps in Brookfield. 2017 version! Very dark brown pour. Aroma hits with barrel & dark fruits. Taste has barrel, dark fruits, sweet malts. Medium to full bodied, a bit of a surprise for a Darkness brew, the blend is good, and there is a solid alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly with barrel. The barrel is nice. This overall is a bit disappointing add expecting more Darkness body to stand-up more with the barrel. 15\n",
      "Can (Dec 26, 2019 canning). Head is initially large, frothy, rocky, off-white, mostly lasting. Body is lightly hazy dark yellow to light amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, corn starch), lightly to moderately hoppy (grapefruit pith), with a light note of metal shavings. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety/watery texture, lively carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly among the best NA beers available. Still room for improvement, mind you, as the the aroma doesn't really shout IPA (it's not really all that hoppy, just some generic pithy grapefruit that barely rises above the malt notes, and it's also slightly marred by a metallic/tinny odor). But wow, the appearance?! Big rocky heads are rare even in beers with alcohol. And a great mouth experience for an NA beer too...excellent lip-smacking sweet/bitter balance and quite a nice fluffy mouthfeel too. Such a shame they couldn't coax an assertive hoppy nose outta this one, and with more interesting hops (which seems like it would be the easiest part, right?)...this could've been near 4+ territory, which would be incredible for an NA beer!\n",
      "relatively fresh can that pours clear bright gold with a large white head offering some retention and lacing. fresh golden doughy pilsner malts, noble hop freshness - minty resinous herbs; some peppery notes, super clean yeast action. moderate carbonation - could be a bit brighter; light body - oily; dry grassy-herbal finish. solid genuine pilsner.\n",
      "Bottle from Growler Guys\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly hazy gold pour, abundant white head. Well carbonated. Nose is all about bit-of-lime Doritos. Yes, it's mosaic, but the bit-of-lime dorito thing is crazy on point. Quite dry, a bit grainy, some perfume, brett, lime peel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the most spectacular table beer, but a solid example in a style I really like for the purpose.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, short retention leaving a cordon. Moderate tart and acidic citrus, white grapes, oak, light bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "On tap at Champps in Brookfield - In a teku! Go Tony ... Unclear orange pour. Orange, pineapple, tropical fruit mousse with a solid dry hop presence. Super hoppy. Juicy. Pale malts. Bitter-sweet fruity finish. This is really good; hoppy, juicy, tasty. 16.6\n",
      "16oz can from Discount in Waukesha with a can date of 8 weeks ago. Very clear copper amber pour with an off-orange head leaving spotty lacing. Aroma has pine, lemon, tangerine, stone fruits, honey, other tropical fruits, and solid dry hopping, with toffee. Taste brings lemon and piney hops, stone fruits, citrus, and honey, all on a solid sweet toffee backbone. Certainly hoppy, although muddled with the hop varietals, yet with that solid malt backbone. Some dry hop evidence, although not so much to completely dry this out. Almost full bodied, with some alcohol presence, the blend is fine/solid. Finishes slightly to the sweet fruity side of bittersweet. Shrug? Congrats on 10 years for one of my obviously favorite breweries. This specific one winds up quite muddled. 13.8\n",
      "Taster at the Mothership. Pours black, with a small, bubbly, tan head. The aroma is chocolate syrup, mild coffee, caramelized sugar, and almond. Sweet and malty, with good balance. Smooth and enjoyable.\n",
      "3.5 yrs aged. Black pour with a foamy thin tan head. Rich darkly sweet aroma with notes of brandy and plum and raisin and dates. Hints of roast malt and blackberry. Big dark boozy flavor with notes of charred barrel, dates, brandy, blackberries, and a little bittersweet dark cocoa. Lingering roasty and gently earthy finish.\n",
      "12oz can from Three Cellars in the Falls. Dark brown pour with reddish tints. Aroma has sweet malts, berry, chocolate, and pastry filling. Taste is thicker than expected; sweet malts, raspberry, cream. Well blended and fairly tasty, staying away from getting too sweet. Medium bodied or a bit more. Finishes to the sweet side of bittersweet. Enjoyed this more than expected. 14.2\n",

      "2018 vintage. 750 ml bottle. Pours black with moderate head. Aromas of creamy roasted malts and bourbon. Flavors follow same with additional chocolate nougat and smoky bourbon. Still a good dose of alcohol but getting better every year.\n",
      "Included in a sampler flight at the brewery. Not sure this was the same Performance Review as I remember it being alot stronger abv. Decent enough but nothing spectacular.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear orange with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with light lacing. Moderate citrus hops, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "Included in a sampler flight at the brewery. Dark black pour. Strong notes of coffee with some alcohol burn. Somewhat on the thin side but not bad overall.\n",
      "Taster at the Mothership. Pours a hazy, straw color, with a big, frothy, white head. A little lime juice, cream, lemon peel, vanilla, and a lot of floral notes. Very sweet and phenolic. Smooth, light, and silky. Delicious!\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear black with a small, frothy beige head, short retention. Moderate rich coffee, light nuttiness, earthy, light hop bitterness, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "473 ml can from the brewery. Pours a murky rhubarb colour with small pinkish head.  Aroma is tart raspberry, lemon and grains.  Flavour has tart candyish raspberry, lemon and mellow grains.  Lighter carbonation.  Decent.\n",
      "Pours barely translucent light honey with a nice eggshell head. Aroma yields dank, piney hops plus zesty orange and raw malt. Flavor delivers funky piney hops, crisp raw malt, oatmeal, tangy orange,  a tropical hint. Texture provides decent body, peppy fizz, and a fruity and oat finish. Double your pleasure, double your oats.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from the brewery. Pours a hazy dark brown with amber highlights and a layer of oil atop the liquid. The head quickly vanishes. Notes of peanut butter, chocolate, toasted marshmallows, fudge, vanilla, roast, oak, and bourbon. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a roasty, nutty, sweet, warming, slightly flat mouthfeel. A little messy and could use more carb, but the aroma is all roasted peanuts and that's fun. Somehow this one is more peanut buttery than others; I guess these particular adjuncts enhance that aspect.\n",
      "Tap. Pours hazy yellow,  small white head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is pungent,  oranges,  armpits,  overripe peaches.  Flavor is light plus sweet,  light bitter.  Medium body.\n",
      "Light orange appearance with mild haze and a white head. Aroma of cranberries, mild lemon zest and a light ginger spice. Similar flavor, adding moderate sweetness and light acidity. Light body with a lingering finish. OK.\n",
      "Interesting light flavor, similar to watermelon or kiwi but not, not the greatest but not terrible\n",

      "Tap. Pours lightly hazy golden yellow,  small white head, some lacing.  Aroma is perfume,  melon,  ginger of pine.  Flavor is light sweet, light bitter,  a bit sharp.  Medium body.  Ug\n",
      "500 ml bottle via trade. Pours a deep, dark, basically opaque brown with a small tan head that settles into a ring and a thin loop of film. Notes of chocolate, vanilla, strawberries, bourbon, oak, soy, figs, and roast. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a flat, sweet, tangy, and warming mouthfeel. It'd be better without the strawberry and with some carbonation. It's messy.\n",
      "650 ml bottle from Canada Craft Club.  Pours a dark brown colour with average-sized tan head.  Aroma is chocolate wafer, peanuts, milk and very light spice.  Flavour is peanut butter, milk chocolate and very light cinnamon.  Slick mouthfeel.  Nice but a little sweet.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear golden orange with a medium, frothy white head, short retention. Heavy fruity hops, moderate hop bitterness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation.\n",

      "Tap. Pours hazy yellow,  small white head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is floral,  tropical,  hint of armpit,  bright, strong. Flavor is light sweet,  light bitter.  Nice.  Medium body\n",
      "Can from Bine & Vine. Pours clear brassy gold with a large foamy white head. Aroma of citrus, a little tropical, and mildly roasty malt support. Med plus body. Flavor is dankish citrus/pine, mildly roasty malt and notes of tropicals. Gets a bit resinish. Pretty dry. Grapefruit zest notes. Very hoppy. Strongly bitter. Excellent.\n",
      "Taster at the Mothership. Pours an unclear, red color, with a small, off-white head. The aroma is raspberry, lemon cream, vanilla, and strawberry. Sweet and fruity, with a lovely, mellow tart flavor. Light and remarkably crisp and creamy. This is a fruity and delicious sour.\n",
      "16 oz. Aroma is chocolate, maple syrup-covered French toast, faint wood, faint Bourbon, faint licorice. Pours a really dark brown to black with a one finger tan head with decent retention. Taste is highly sweet, never cloying, light to moderately bitter, faintly tart, with major maple flavor. Delicious.\n",
      "12 oz. can purchased at Molly's Spirits in Lakeside, CO. Thanks G-unit! Pours a clear dark ruby color with a large khaki head and great retention. Good lacing. Roasted malt and coffee aroma. The flavor matches the nose, except the coffee flavor is more dominant. Mellow overall due to the added vanilla. Low carbonation. Medium+ body and semi creamy mouthfeel. Smooth.\n",
      "Clear orange appearance with a beige head. Aroma of berries and light grainy notes. Similar flavor, adding moderate sweetness and minimal bitterness. Light body with a lingering fruity finish. OK.\n",

      "Tap. Pours clear golden,  medium white head,  good lacing.  Aroma is grain,  grass,  light citrus,  hint of bread.  Flavor is light sweet,  light bitter,  yeasty.  Light body,  soft mouthfeel.  Interesting.\n",
      "Tastes like you would expect from a blue raspberry drink, similar to an icy but not as sweet. Fairly enjoyable\n",
      "Pours cloudy yellow in color with a white head, ok drinking beer, tastes mildly like cinnamon toast crunch but nothing special, disappointed, tap at brewery.\n",
      "Chocolate, cocoa powder, dark coffee aroma. Dark brown and mocha head. Definitely a dry, coffee, cocoa, cereal, light bitter hop finish, with only a slight bit of vanilla.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy gold with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Medium grainy and earthy wheat malt, light lemon notes, light jasmine and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "On tap. Pours black with no head. Aromas of roasted malts, alcohol and light coconut. Flavors of only vanilla, sour bourbon, light coconut, and sweet roasted malts. Hmmm... messy compared to the original Midnight, but that doesn’t say much...\n",
      "Interesting concept beer. Not enough of the farmhouse yeastin aroma or flavor. Nice reddish pink without looking too colorful. Flavor is very real-life. Tap at brewery.\n",
      "Jesus this is bad. Not sure what discriminates this from their lager, taste very similar with harsh grainy notes, corn, acetaldehyde. Light bitterness.\n",
      "On tap. Pours black with light head. Aromas of dry coconut, vanilla and slick roasted malts. Flavors are Bounty. Very nice coconut stout. There should be a style...\n",
      "Pours dark brown, aroma and upfront taste is a brownie but way too much smoke and charcoal flavor at the end, tap at brewery.\n",
      "16 oz can at Austin City Limits. Pours a pale amber with a dense white head. Tons of lacing. Big citrus fruit scents. Juicy flavors with a dry mouthfeel. Excellent IPA.\n",
      "Pours an amber with thick white head and heavy lacing.  Lots of malt on the nose.  Mouthfeel is very heavy with pronounced bitterness.  Nuts, molasses and some metal taste.  Lasting bitter finish.\n",
      "Can from the brewery. Pours opaque orange/gold with a frothy white head. Tastes like smooth resin, oats, booze, grapefruit hops, and biscuit malt. Medium body and low carbonation. Smells like biscuit malt, oats, resin, grapefruit hops, and faint booze.\n",

      "16oz can. Milky light orange beige with a thick sticky sandy head.  Lots of light bready cereal malts.  Some sweetness and tropical juiciness but a lot of old grass and papery flavors. Strange\n",
      "Nice hops bitter flavor and palate. Hazy deep yellow. Aroma is hops with some lactose. Flavor is sweet and fruity. Tap at brewery\n",
      "Pours dark black, aroma a nice mix of malts and sweet vanilla, nice malt body with a sweet vanilla-forward taste, well done, tap at brewery.\n",
      "Light Niagara grape aromas and taste. Fun and different but more of a hazy ipa and less of an aged flavor. Maybe it needed to be aged longer. Great beer, but not 100% to the planned style. Tap at brewery\n",
      "Bomber from The Davis Food Co-op. Pours cranberry juice color with a pink, transient head. Aroma is cider with black currant - my nose isn't picking up cranberry. Med minus body. Flavor is tart cranberry, apple skin and black currant. It's tart, but the currants add some offsetting sweetness. Decent, drinkable.\n",
      "375 mL bottle. Pours clear and pale yellow. Smells of lemon, grain, lots of cardamom. Tastes of cardamom too. Grainy and light lemon lime tartness. Honey lingers in the finish. Dry and light. Well carbonated. It's good, but very light in all aspects.  It's very possible I would really dig this in a different setting, but it's not doing it for me here.\n",
      "Finally getting around to this a couple months late. Pours near black with frothy brown foam that settles to a thin cap, moderate lacing. Aromas are simpler than expected, mostly sweet malt, mild ginger snap and a touch of coffee. Flavors bring a vanilla sweetness to the forefront, combining with the roast character, and not much in the way of ginger snap. Very pleasant and easy drinking smoothness. Medium-light mouthfeel and a fairly clean finish. Will try again next year for sure!\n",
      "On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black and a little transparent at the edges. Smells of bourbon, oak, earthy coffee. Tastes of bourbon, sweet chocolate, coffee, oak. Vanilla and sugar lingers. Big, boozy, heavy, and sweet. But it's very flavorful. I don't often enjoy beers like this, but this is excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear light golden appearance with a small white head. Mild aroma of zesty hops, toasted grain and a light herbal spice. Similar flavor, adding mild to moderate bitterness and light sweetness. Light body with a slight watery finish. OK.\n",
      "375 mL bottle. Pours deep amber with a khaki head. Smells of red wine, slight bready malts, oak, some fruity yeast. Tastes tart up front. Gives way to some brown bread with dark fruit yeast flavors. Then red wine sourness kicks back in with an oaky finish. I didn't know if this was going to be sour, but I thought it might. I'm not sure I'm happy that it is, though. I kinda wanted to see if they could make a nice dubbel. It's pleasant, but not what I really wanted from it.\n",
      "From a can. Pours a cloudy copper with an off white head.  Aromas are of pineapple and coconut. Flavors are tart and fruity.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle.  Pours black with a khaki head.  Smells of aggressive grassy hops and strong roasted malt.  Tastes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee bitterness immediately, slight malty sweetness, and some grassy and spicy hop bitterness.  Medium body and remarkably drinkable.  This is wonderful.\n",
      "The body is a clear, dark caramel color. No head. Aroma is strong caramel and salt, and some dark stone fruits. Taste is fairly salty and tart, a touch of fruit sweetness at the end. Texture is crisp and fizzy.\n",
      "Tap. Pours clear black,  small beige head,  decent lacing.  Aroma is light,  roasty,  mocha,  ash, more roast. Flavor is light plus sweet,  lighter bitter,  roasty.  Medium body,  soft mouthfeel,  low carbonation.\n",

      "[Draught at Tapworks Pub] Pours a murky yellow-gold with an average size lasting frothy white head. Nice hoppy aroma, citrusy, piney and herbal, along with tropical fruit and sweet bready malt in the background. Nice flavour as well, follows the aroma, along with an average bitter finish. Medium bodied. This surprised me with how good it is.\n",
      "Cask @ Fox & Goose, Hebden Bridge.  Golden with a small head. It has an ordinary hoppy nose but is full of cucumber in its taste that lingers.  The style of the ale is redundant for it.\n",
      "Pours a deep, dark brown with a finger of tan foam that settles to a ring, no lacing. Aromas of roast malt and a slight sweetness. Flavors are more abundant with a nice sweet toffee dominating among biscuit and mild nut presence. This is how I like brown ales - with low hop bitterness and focus on the malt. Well done!\n",

      "Copenhagen 26/12 2018. 35,5 cl bottle from Voldby Købmandsgård Webshop. This is the 2016 release with an ABV of 11,9. The Classic label with the tagline “Is good for everything a flavoured stout ought to be good for”.\n",

The aroma is quite delicate and complex, with notes of liquorice, molasses, cough syrup. Bittersweet, chalky taste with more liquorice and some stone fruit. Medicinal bitterness in the finish. Soft carbonation. Very well put together.\n",

      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. served to a tulip showing a cloudy, orangey/gold color, a fluffy layer of soft white froth that slowly reduced to a ring, with foamy spots of lacing. The nose was soft grain, citrus as orange & lemon/lime, a bit of pit fruit, tartness & tanginess, and some agave sweetness. Medium bodied, with decent spritz to the effervescence, the taste was similar, with amped tartness & tanginess, a bit of earthy astringency, and light salinity to the finish. Very palate appealing. Like it when the flavor equals or outshines the aroma.\n",

First swig was really quite thin with watery flavours of very light hops, honey and a little nuts. Finish is quite plain with minimal lingering flavours.\n",
      "Acquired a can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom! Can date of 1-23-20. Aroma shows apricot, peach, house yeast. Surprised at the lasting grassy note through the melon and fruit. Texture has a massively juicy center that turns dry. Alcohol is not here. Well above average! \n",

      "Draft at Bru Craft. Unexpected cloudy amber pour. Slim coat of soft off-white foam. No lace. Malty brew with some dark citrusy hops and faint florals. Poppyseed bagels. Cassia. Tangelos. Cloves. Not sure I have the right beer. Had them check and they assured me it's the right keg. Feels vaguely Belgian but not like a Saison at all.\n",
      "Aroma 7. Appearance 4. Taste 7. Palate 3. Overall 13. Peanut butter and hazelnut aroma. Taste is peanut butter and sweet. A hint of roasted malt and amount of peanut butter aftertaste.\n",
      "Can from Cask & Flask in San Jose, CA. Aroma is earthy chocolate, mild coffee, maybe some vanilla cream (less coconut). Taste is smooth chocolate, salt is understated but \"feels\" like it evens out the taste a bit... not getting much coconut and actually I'm okay with it being more underdeveloped (again, like the salt, probably adds to the overall sum). Pretty solid although not especially memorable.\n",

      "Can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom. Light palate and crisp with a bigger yeast presence than expected. Malt backbone was Pilsner-like with some mild sweetness.\n",
      "Can from Cask & Flask in San Jose, CA. Aroma is tart berry, some unripe peach, hazy juice vibes coming through. Taste is tart, def getting some of the blueberry which is nice, and then goes more juicy hazy peach (but not overly so). A nice tart IPA if you're in the mood for that sort of thing.\n",
      "W aromacie na pierwszy plan rzuca się czekolada deserowa, później lekki miód ale chili niewyczuwalne. W smaku zdecydowanie słodkie bez jakiejkolwiek goryczki. Uczucie w ustach pozostawia lekki posmak alkoholowy ale naprawdę minimalny. Podsumowując bardzo zaskakujące pod względem zapachu w którym przewyższa czekolada nad kawa zbożową. Polecam z całego serca.\n",
      "Can from Cask & Flask in San Jose, CA. Aroma is cinnamon, cherry syrup, some chocolate. Taste is chalky cinammon, more cherry (sometimes natural / sometimes artificial), chocolate malts. Overall I went back and forth on this one... def better as it warmed but initial impressions were that it was a bit heavy on the cinnamon and sometimes tasted a bit cherry adjunct-y.\n",
      "This APA poured a hazy, light yellow colour with a bright white, creamy head. Nice lacing. Scents include corn, cereal and a little cooked veggies. First swig was a little thin but nice in the flavour dept. Flavours of corn, malt and light hops. Finish is lightly bitter with that corn flavour lingering.\n",
      "Bottle from Cask & Flask in San Jose, CA. Aroma is tart unripe fruit, some spicy funk, apricot, oaky. Taste is spiced dry fruit (apricots), fuzzy funk, crisp and tart with dry oak. This was solid but I was expecting something a little more extra special from this awesome brewery team-up.\n",
      "Sampled at P house, didn't know Bolero was making real beer styles that don't cause diabetes. Clears golden with medium head. Not as bad as i expected it would be but theres some champagne type yeast notes and a touch of weird spice. Still happy to see a non lactose, pesticide fruit ridden, offering from BS.\n",

      "Clear dark brown to black beer, no head. Aroma: that's a lot of caramel in it, and a lot of coffee... also alcohol is very present, more roasted notes, somewhat nutty. MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: sweet start, bit malty, sourish, good roast, some coffee, dark chocolate. Aftertaste: bitter, malty, grains, bit sourish, caramel.\n",
      "Can, from Beer52. Black-brown, thin short lived pale beige head, and low condition. Big sweet nutty almond and chocolate ice cream initially in the nose, with some bitter coconut notes developing. Full and sweet in the mouth to start but quickly turns dry and bitter with some oily off notes. Finish is rough and bitter and a little nutty.\n",

      "Cask @ The Pub, Todmorden.  Has this the week before finding the Maple edition and the Manchester Beer Festival and thought this version better in comparison.  Dark creamy-bubbly off-white head and a chocolate heavy nose, with a crisper lesser chocolate roasted taste.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Ernie's in Lexington. An orange pour with floral nose and cinnamon in taste. Different.\n",

      "Pours a hazy golden/amber colour with a huge white throthy head. Aromas of stoney fruits, apricots, peaches, tangerine, tropical fruits, apple pie, bread, jam, a little honey and sugar. Taste has the same but slightly milder notes than the aroma with added grass, spice, orange and lemon zest with a hoppy bitterness on the finish. Fair carbonation on the palate with a medium bodied mouthfeel and a fairly long zesty, hoppy and fruity aftertaste. Really nice\n",
      "Canned, 440 ml, shared with Simon, Max and Miro B. Hazy orange, white head. Hoppy, tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, juicy. Smooth. Medium bodied.\n",

      "Can from Lupe Pintos. Hazy pale golden body with a white head. Lively carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of peach, lemon jelly and brioche. Flavour of lemongrass and lemon zest. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Soft fizz. Crisp and juicy. Fantastic.\n",

      "Bottiglia. Il gusto al naso propende per l'orzo. L'intensità olfattiva è normale, permanendo in maniera sufficiente. Il mantello birroso superiore resiste abbastanza. La grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il liquido è di apparenza limpida. Il colore è giallo ambrato. Il corpo è rotondo. L'amaro è pronunciato. La forza gustativa è normale e si prolunga in modo sufficiente. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di pronta beva. Il finale è semplice e dissetante. Il retrogusto è di media intensità. Il tetto della bocca riconosce impressioni di miele, crosta di pane, un accenno di resinoso quasi balsamico, erbaceo, agrumi, pompelmo rosa e arancia.\n",

      "Ever so slightly hazy copper and lightly bronzed coloured body with a bright orange tint and a smallish, two centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of citrus, light white grape juice, a dash of flowers and some pungent resin in the mix that all shows a nice level of alpha acid from the hops and a light dose of oranges and bitterness as well. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong rich grassy flavours up front, but the citrus, grapefruit, resin and supportive malt all really come through and provide a very nice balance, along with a good deal of alcohol noticeable, especially at the end, without much fruits or sugars. Aftertaste shows the hops and attached bitterness quite strongly with a lot of citrus and grapefruit  notes and some floral flavours towards the end that hit the hoppy and bitter notes nicely. Overall, a pungent and strongly hopped beer that has a great level of alpha acids and hops to make this feel almost that of a West Coast IPA, but made here on the East Coast! I sampled this sixteen ounce, pint-sized can, given to me by the GM of the brewery, after a hockey game here in Arlington (Ballston), Virginia in May 2019 - Thanks Erik!\n",

      "Keg at the Euston tap. A hazed translucent golden coloured pour with a fine white head. Aroma is subdued, fishy, stake whwat, grass.. Flavour is composed of range banana loaf, doughy wheat tangy apple, frorhy carbonation. Palate is light tangy, froth carbonation, banana bread mineral. Ok.\n",
      "High tart and sour, but clean with a great world class profile. Light and refreshing but a fantastic sipping beer. Tilt birmingham\n",
      "# 1152; 7/2018. Chuťove velmi bohaté pivo. Silně pražené s lehce nakyslým ocáskem, který mi připomněl darjeelingy. Kávové, sušené ovoce. Parádní dlouhé doznívání.\n",
      "HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.\n",

      "# 1151; 7/2018. Velmi dobré, vícevrstevnaté, tmavé pšeničné. Ovocné, kolové, topinkové. Bohužel i s trochu lakovitým ocáskem.\n",
      "2016 Edition: Dark fruit, woody oaky, lactic sour aroma and flavors. Deep plum date and raisin aroma and flavor with tannic oaky and a Cabernet like red wine finish.  Sour maybe 5 or 6 of 10. All lactic/acetic.  Complex dark red wine flavors with the dark fruits are great.  Really delicious and complex.\n",
      "Not the best taste in the world, but I am not able to say so many bad things from a beer which costs 30 cents... Not a bad taste.\n",
      "Mildly syrupy, but not overly sweet. Woody and raisiny, if that’s a real word. Not your “traditional beer” taste. Sold by the ounce at Boxelder in Miami. Very interesting to try, worth trying, but personally wouldn’t try it again, not my style.\n",
      "4 finger creamy beige head. Fantastic spider-web lacing.\n",
      "Pitch black beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma of vanilla, cocoa, hazelnut coffee, milk chocolate and a light brown round woodiness. Slight note of emptied oak barrel. Simple but effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is similar at first but throws in a lot of acidic vinous notes along with a bigger gourmand presence and a clear boozy note. Not necessarily bourbon but a general spirit booziness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is somewhat dense and chewy but with a lighter landing that I don't fully appreciate. Sticky. Medium bitterness. Medium-low carbonation. Semi-long finish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: Expected way more to be honest. Maybe it needs to warm up more to show its true potential. Been resting in the cabinet for quite a while too but it feels unbalanced and a bit all over the place.\n",
      "44cl can. A murky yellow golden beer with a white foamy head. Aroma of mellow fruits, mild citra, yeast, wheat. Taste is mealy juicy mild hoppy, wheat malt, citra, yeasty finish.\n",
      "This one was surprising to me.  It's essentially the perfect sessionable Belgian styled amber ale. Awesome spicy Belgian yeast backed by strong caramel malt is the main flavor and aroma component. A nip of raisin and cotton candy. Lightly sweet, very malty, but well in balance. This would pair with any pub grub. Nice substantial chewy mouthfeel that lightens as it fades. A modern masterpiece from the only Trappist brewery in North America. Impressive.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 5.1%. Ruddy light-brown amber, with a large, stable head. Relatively clear. Very 'amber ale' aroma, as might be expected! Hints of red berry and a light but slightly dark maltiness, extremely mild woody elements. Low carbonation. Gentle mineral-water aspects, some red/dark berry elements, pretty laid-back in general. Light, sweet amber ale. Faint hints of a toasted bread malt. The delicacy actually makes this come off as pretty high-quality. Don't expect an all-singing all-dancing brew and this little gem will give you a luxurious, genteel drinking experience. Understated and, I think, underrated.\n",
      "Birra rovinata dalla GDO quasi sicuramente,una IPA bilanciata ma con un corpo scarno.Schiuma abbondante ma non permanente.L’importa industriale è evidente nell’analisi visiva.Tutto sommato da “compagnia”\n",

      "A pleasing imperial stout delivers a polished experience without going overboard. It is hard to see much here that isn't available in a typical example of the style. Even so thanks to Drake for sharing this during a winter tasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Smoky coffee, espresso, and sticky hazy malts crawl over the nose in search of places to leave a mark. The fluid black base supports a lean mocha head.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Smoky plum, dark fruit, and chocolate empower the rich profile that warms the throat. It then ebbs into a malty dense texture that sticks in the palate. There are few objections though nothing that stands out as an amazing release that sets itself apart in a busy crowd.\n",
      "Really nice clean rock solid full bodied complex yet light and honey-like. Old joint stock and pub birmingham\n",
      "A slightly bitter astringent taste, but a good body and nice malt profile. Old joint and stock birmingham\n",
      "375 ml bottle\n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent gem from the East Coast shows that Allagash is still on top of their game when it comes to balancing tartness with depth. It might not be my favorite release yet just thinking about it makes me wish that I had a glass to sip right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Vinegary plums, raspberry, and a sharp abrasive profile gnaw at the nose. The vanilla head rests over a bed of caramel as the lean base swirls freely around the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Cherry and Sour Patch Kids imbued with raspberry cling to the senses as the vinegar works it way into every corner of the throat. A rich finish of freshly picked strawberries polish off an excellent experience. I would happily drink this again if I came across a tap line.\n",

Flavour is composed of semi sweet, orange rind z sticky fruit Smoothie dank hop, grass, grassy tropical. Juicy,. Palate is medium sweet, grainy, moderate carbonation. Sticky hop. Ok\n",

      "\n",
      "Well past its prime, this release shows what happens when you sit on a bottle too long. I can only imagine what it must have been like in its prime to still be this solid. If it weren't for the packed shelves I would love to try a few more Love Child releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "A rich ivory head dances upwards as the caramel body chews at the foundation. A strong sour intensity has taken root as the brett is center stage. Behind it the musty profile indicates other aspects have mellowed with time.\n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Acidic astringent chocolate tickles the tongue. Clearly past its prime, this Flemish sour hits the palate with a harsh bite. Even the finish, tart Tootsie Roll, shows signs of having been more polished in the past. It will be nice to get more of these out of the cellar to make room for fresher offerings.\n",
      "W aromacie kawa, czerwone owoce i szlachetne kwaśne nuty, szlachetny alkohol, super. Barwa czarna, piana ładna. W smaku pełne, półsłodkie, czekolada, kawa, kwaśna wiśnia, dobry, mocny trunek. Na finiszu nieco pestkowe. Bardzo fajny ris i bardzo szlachetna kwaśność, super.\n",
      "355ml bottle.  Pours very dark brown with a medium head.  Aroma is beefy bitter roast coffee.  Taste has cola, roast and chocolate.  Beefy finish.\n",
      "Dieses bittet habe ich schon vor einigen Jahren getrunken und ich will mit ihm abschließen.\n",
      "Es ist ein schwerer Belgier, der aber durch seine Hopfennoten überrascht und erfreut. Es hat im Hintergrund eine fruchtige Rumtopf-Atmosphäre, aber mit Hopfenspitzen vom Nugget-Hopfen, die wahrlich erfreuen.\n",
      "Kein klassisches belgisches Strong Ale, aber ein durchaus aromatisches Bier.\n",
      "33cl swing top bottle bought at the brewpub. A clear deepest amber beer with a mid sized good lasting off-white head. Aroma of resinous hops, spruce, caramel, red malt. Taste of strong caramelized malt, red malt, spruce, pine needles, strong hoppy and malty finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "The packaging drew me in but despite having a bottle in the cellar I finally caved and ordered a draft at a local bar. I'm happy though as the results are subpar for a Central Waters imperial stout. This is less imperial and more mundane. Save your money for their other more polished releases.\n",

      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "A delicate mocha head rests above the fluid black base. Moving freely around the shaker it releases droves of smoky ash, espresso, and cocoa in a profile that feels a bit tame for the style. \n",
      "\n",
      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Smoky espresso, malt, and cocoa enrich the palate with a fluid refreshing feel that dances rather than crawls over the tongue. Given the description I was anticipating a bit more. I'll still crack open the bottle to see if I get better results but overall this feels like a half hearted effort from Amherst.\n",
      "Unfiltered lightly hazy yellow pour. Large tight bubbled head. Moderate lacing. Pale malt, light breadiness, and some grassy hops in the aroma. Very clean with a moderately bitter hop fade. Crisp and poundable. A very good German pils.\n",
      "355ml can. Murky, darkest brown colour with average to huge, thick, frothy to creamy, slowly osteoporosing, moderately lacing, dark beige to tan head. Citrusy hoppy and roasty, chocolately, dark malty aroma, notes of cocoa, chocolate, coffee, hints of lemon, orange, mandarine with a zesty touch, some grass and chlorophyll as well. Taste is dry, grassy and zesty, citrusy hoppy, roasty and chocolately dark malty, notes of orange, lemon, mandarine, lemon zest, hints of cocoa, coffee. Not fully harmonious, malty and hoppy flavours remain slightly separated due to the high-grade dryness; some more sweetness could build a bridge. Not bad, though.\n",

      "A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.\n",
      "\n",
      "AROMA / APPEARANCE\n",
      "Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.\n",

      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate. The results speak for themselves as this world class imperial stout delivers a product worth traveling or trading for.\n",

      "This would not have been my first choice but as it was a special release for Vintage's anniversary I rolled the dice. Unfortunately it did not deliver. In hindsight I would have happily gone for one of their other special releases rather than a rum infused sour that lacks a core identity.\n",

      "FLAVOR / PALATE\n",
      "Cranberries, flat Dr Pepper, and shots of rum do little to generate enthusiasm once the novelty wears off. A spicy transition rushes into the tart finish with little thought for balance or continuity. First rum, then winter warmer, then anise sour, it cannot decide what facet should be its defining characteristic. As a result it is hard to recommend this unless you really need to rate everything on the menu.\n",

      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A clear bright golden beer with a white lacing. Aroma of grassy and sweet citrusy hops. Taste of citrusy bitter hops, grassy, pale malt, easy.\n",
      "From tap at Bierrevier, Basel. Hazy grayish pale golden color with hardly any head. The aroma is full with loads of lime and ginger, lime peel and orange peel. Smells like lemonade. Medium body with a medium acidity, a light tartness and a distinct salinity. The flavor is similar to the smell with an overload of citric notes and ginger, lime juice, citric peel, lemonade and faint notes of acetic acid. Finishes with more lime and ginger, wheat and some lactic notes. Overall with lots of ginger and citric notes and borderline artificial. Lacks a bit of complexity. Not much beer character left.\n",

      "Vi er benket langs bordet og selvsagt topp motiverte for nok en kveld med inntak av primærprofylakse, rundhåndet distribuert av seremonimester Melberg, feb-20: etter Track Sonoma ble denne en nedtur. Overmoden ananas, syregress, lett besk grapefrukt, kål og noen halvvisne urter. Tørr og litt besk avslutning. Humlene skal være Ekuanot, Citra og Mandarina Bavaria. Mandarinahumlen kjente jeg ikke så mye som et snev av. Fra fat, helt uklar strågul med ok skum.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Ultramørkebrun / svart. Filmskum med litt farge. Aroma av karamell & overmoden frukt. Smaken som aromaen. Litt kjedelig. Lett tørr, fruktig avslutning.\n",
      "From tap at Bierrevier, Basel. Vintage 2019. Hazy light golden color with no head. The aroma is funky - leather, wood, white grapes, brett, some lemon peel, some elderflower. Light body with a low to average carbonation, a medium-heavy acidity and a light tartness. The flavor starts acidic with citric notes, lactic acidity and unripe berries. Finishes dry, lightly wheaty and lightly tart. Overall sour and refreshing with a nice complexity. \n",

      "440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!\n",

      "Bottle from Erzengel. Cheers. Grassy aroma with a floral streak and underlying yeasty sour element. Light gold. Thick foamy head. Light bitter. Some tangy sourness but overall it's rather herby. Light bodied but slick. Soft-fizzy carbonation. Long dry astringent finish.\n",
      "Sample at the taproom during the \"Streetside 3 Year Anniversary Bash!\" on 09/28/2019. Dark reddish-brown color with a medium thin light beige head that recedes steadily to a film. Patchy lacing. Aroma of  malt, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Medium to full-bodied with flavors of roasted malt, vanilla fudge and mild roast coffee. The finish is sweet with a chocolatey aftertaste.\n",

      "Sample at the taproom during the \"Streetside 3 Year Anniversary Bash!\" on 09/28/2019. Clear dark amber color with a medium off-white head that diminishes gradually to a dense film. Small patches of lace. Aroma of bourbon, malt, fruit and hops. Full-bodied with flavors of oaky bourbon, caramel malt, vanilla and mild earthy hop. The finish is oaky with a bourbon and malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.\n",
      "Can: Hazy yellow color, white head. Aroma is tropical, fruity. Flavor is also fruity, tropical, lychee, hoppy. Nice one.\n",
      "Can picked up from Liebick Getränkemarkt, Germering and consumed at home Attenkirchen, Wednesday 5th February 2020, cooking Spaghetti Bolognese and listening to Steve Lamaq on 6Music. A superb stout ok it's a little hoppy and some might suggest it blurs the line between Stout and Black IPA, roastiness and with a really good softness. A touch of burnt toast, dry finish. Very good.\n",

Odczucie w ustach całkiem pełne, nagazowanie mocne, przez co daje odczucie zapchania, goryczka jest, nie jakaś intensywna ale jest. Ziołowa lekko trawiasta. Nie jest to jakiś super wyjątkowe piwo ale ciekawszy od zwykłych lagerow. Na pewno słabszy niż pils.\n",
      "Bottle 33cl. @home poured into a footed pilsner glass. Clear medium golden, good frothy white head, mostly diminishing, fair lacing. Aroma sweet malt, grain, grass, draff. Taste medium sweet and light bitter, malty, grain, straw, iron notes. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, sweetbitter aftertaste, paper notes, iron notes linger on, average helles.\n",
      "This was a non-nitro pour of this beer from a tap. Not sure if a separate beer should be added. Anyhoo, pours a near black, slim hot choclate colored head. As expected, big milk chocolate aroma. Flavor is cocoa powder, some lactose roundness in the mouthfeel. Not sure how this is different from their chocolate milkshake stout. Pretty good beer, if very sweet.\n",
      "Flaska från Systembolaget. Gyllengul grumlig vätska med tjock vitt skum. Tydliga aromer av gräs och örter och frukter. Skumbananen finns också där. Brödig i smaken och örtighet återkommer. Lätt syrligt avslut. Bra munfyllnad och angenäm eftersmak.\n",

      "440ml can brewed in England at 6.5%. Picturesque head, decent duration. Only somewhat frosty-looking golden amber, which in the light can be more orange, out of it more yellow or even hints of...jade! Papaya, mango, orange pith aroma. Moderate carbonation. Tastes of sweet gooseberry, mango, a hint of orange juice, with bready malt soaking up the fruit juices...a nice juicy IPA. Different, but straightforward and easy-drinking. Dry-hopping giving flavour without as much bitterness. Good hop showcase from Cloudwater - one of their best approaches to brewing, IMO. Nothing to rave about here, but a nice little number for sure, with no issues whatsoever.\n",

Light palate. Watery taste, sweetish bland malts, some papery and starchy aspects. Sometimes harshish bitter finish, but mostly bland. Fine sauna beer.\n",

      "January 18th, 2014 - My best guess is that this beer is going to be a gob smack of Columbus hops, practically dripping out of the bottle with resin and pine. And that's exactly what I get. But before I get to the very succinct review (half of the word count is \"resin\"), I want to admire the look, which in this slightly fluted glass has a beautiful auburn color with a good finger of head, and a rich population of geysers. The aroma is sticky, fresh and resinous, and direct with it's hop profile, as expected. The flavor has one foot in the pine camp and the other in a rusty metallic taste. It is intense, and squeezes a long line of honey through the taste to give this a super sweet flavor, which gets tiring by the end of the glass. But those first few bold sips are fine to get an idea of how strong a directly and forward Columbus hops based beer can be.\n",

      "Tap at FOB, Rimini, Italy. Pours black with a fine dark brown foam, very creamy and high, persistent as well. Aroma, with the beer protected by such a thick foam, is delicate, of cocoa beans, licorice stick, vanilla. But warning up, the ginger becomes more evident. Body is average, maybe a little in the dense side, with moderate carbonation. Taste is pretty bitter and roasty, with a long final too. Overall, I expected more, although it hides the alcohol rather well.\n",

Solid bit of haze kit here, unclear golden orange, white froth, plenty of luscious exotics, of which come to fruition on the palate, pokey grapefruit, leafy pine, soft resin, mango.. Some sherbet hints coming into play as the carbonation starts to wind down but on the whole I'm likin this.\n",

      "First of all, boozy af. You can really taste the bourbon. Along with that is vanilla and an earthiness I associate with fresh tobacco. A dark, complex beer that you practically need to chew, the mouthfeel is so thick and smooth, like a Dove bar. One of my absolute favs, though I cant handle more that about 8oz at a time - that ABV is no joke\n",

      "Awesome beer, dark, complex, boozy af. Only reason I didn't rate more highly is because I tried the 2017 and that was even better\n",
      "Gose in the new Cascade house style, 37.5 cl bottle shared by Meeki Meekio, thanks Marc!  Eggshell-white; mousy, medium thick, stable head over a hazy ochre-tinged apricot blonde beer.  Aroma of dried wakame, old coriander seed, sourdough, sour apples, old dry lemon peel, some lime zest, bread crust.  Crisp, sour onset, lemony, sour apples but also a subtle sweetish pineapple accent, minerally carbonation, drying lactic tartness throughout accompanied by a light seaweed saltiness – but remaining very light, much lighter in fact than in most modern Goses (and probably closer to the salty level of historical Gose).  Some chicken broth-like ‘meatiness’ in the end, over a wheaty-bready, slick maltiness, spiced by a dash of old coriander seed.  Pretty nice, seemingly a bit more complex than the average modern Gose, but at the same time more restrained and less salty as well.  Interesting one, quite different from the classic (75 cl) Cascade sours I am used to from the ‘old’ days…\n",

      "One of the ‘groundbreaking collaborations’ (their own words) Stone Berlin – no longer in existence – has done, in this case with Mahr’s Bräu in Bamberg and legendary Avery in the U.S.; from an impressive magnum bottle shared by Filip Van Damme at Nieuwjaarsreceptie Gentse Biervereniging, cheers!  Medium thick, mousy, pale greyish off-white head lacing in shreds over a clear, copper-hued burgundy red-brown beer.  Aroma of cooked sausages, fried horse steak, dusty old wood, hard caramel, walnut purée, dried figs, marzipan, wet toast, mushrooms pan-fried with brown sugar, brandy.  Sweet onset with impressions of dried fig and date as well as some apple peel and blue plum; medium carb, full oily and bit vinous mouthfeel.  Caramelly malt core with a soft brown-bready edge as well as an upcoming smoky note, reminiscent of smoked sausages and even (vaguely) bonfire, plunging into a long, warming, complex finish coloured by a late peppery hop bitter touch, lingering malt sweetness and smokiness as well as brandy-like alcohol.  Nice, full, complex ‘Rauchbock’ – Aecht Schlenkerla’s example amplified with American craft brewing boldness.  Different and alluring, one of the most interesting and satisfying beers of the whole evening for me.\n",
      "Dark sour ale – essentially a broadening of the Flemish ‘oud bruin’ category – by this classic craft brewery in Minneapolis, aged in red wine barrels, thanks to tderoeck for sharing.  Some loose, off-white bubbles around the edge, but quickly gone into complete ‘headlessness’; hazy dark mahogany brown robe.  Aroma of passionfruit, dry sherry, sour plums, candi sugar, fig jam, pech, brown rum, wood glue, old red wine, brambleberries, brandy.  Fruity, estery onset, sour with a sweetish core, impressions of blackberry, fig and sour plums, soft carb, strong lactic sourness drying the palate, over a caramelly, softly bready malt backbone; woody tannins add further dryness in the finish, with a strong and evidently unsurprising impression of dry and tannic red wine (‘gecorseerd’ as we say in Dutch), quite complex, woody, fruity long and warming.  Maintains relatively high drinkability whilst adding considerable complexity, like the best Flemish ‘oud bruin’ beers; among the best American interpretations of this style I had so far.  Experienced and acclaimed Surly never disappoints, it seems.\n",

      "500ml bottle. Pours clear golden with a nice white head. Aroma of grass, white bread, light citrus, hint of spices. Taste of bread, grass, biscuit, citrus, slightly floral. Sweet arrival with a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium body. It won't blow your mind but it isn't meant to. Perfect for what it is - a well made, refreshing pale ale.\n",

      "Draft. An unclear golden beer with a white head. The aroma has notes of lemons, citrus peal, straw, hops, and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of citrus peal, straw, hops, and malt, leading to a bitter finish.\n",

      "Butelka 0,5 l. Piana biała, dość obfita i gęsta, opada do warstwy, z drobną koronką. Kolor słomkowy do jasnozłotego, klar. W aromacie nuty słodowe, kukurydziane sodu pilzneńskiego, siana, truskawkowe estrowe, na początku też lekka ścierka, która potem się ulatnia. W smaku lekko wodniste, pustawe, półwytrawne, słód, kukurydza, siano. Pełnia niska, wysycenie średnie do średnio wysokiego, goryczka bardzo niska.

      "Vanilla malt notes. Poured amber golden body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet with white chocolate note alongside vanilla and lactose so not for the sour toothed. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish if you can extract it from the other sweeter notes around it. The mystery of white stout's raisin d'etre remains.\n",

      "12 oz. can poured to a fest chalice at home showing a clear & bright , light gold/straw color, with a decent layer of white froth, and some spots & strands of lacing. The nose was soft grain, straw, almost wheat-like qualities, with slightly ripe notes of lemon. Light to medium bodied, with lively, seltzer-like carbonation, the taste was as the aroma, plus modest lemony tartness & tanginess, a bit of grainy astringency, and some dryness to the finish. Very drinkable & refreshing.\n",

      "Low-alcoholic ‘farmhouse ale’ (so a sour saison, basically) by this acclaimed Berliner Weisse specialist, from a 75 cl bottle shared at Nieuwjaarsreceptie Gentse Biervereniging.  Egg-white, mousy, dense, medium thick, slowly dissipating head, ‘dirty’ ochre-tinged peach blonde robe, entirely clouded (I got the end of the bottle, clearly).  Aroma of green peppercorns, sesame seed, wild apples, fresh sage, dried rosemary, bread dough, yoghurt, old moldy oranges.  Freshly fruity onset, estery, with hints of green gooseberry, medlar and sour apple, softly carbonated with a slick and evidently thin mouthfeel; very bready, bit biscuity maltiness dried by lactic sourness, ending quite earthy and estery with yeasty breadiness and herbal-spicy notes, dry and floral.  Very quenching and quite complex for a beer of this ABV; German Schneeeule quality applied to an Anglo-Saxon idea based on a Belgian tradition…\n",

      "Coconut- and pineapple-flavoured milkshake IPA, thanks Sérgio (the brewer of Totenhopfen in Luxemburg) for sharing.  Papery lacing, off-white, mousy, stable head on a misty apricot blonde beer with ochre-ish hue.  Aroma very strongly coconut-forward (coconut milk), some pineapple jam but much less outspoken than the coconut, blood orange, vanilla custard, dough, milk powder, powder sugar, ground hazelnuts somewhere, nougat.  Sweet and creamy onset with a citric twist to it, pineapple indeed in a candied- or jam-like way, hints of mango, lychee and blood orange, fizzy carb (quite sharpish for the style but not to a bothersome degree); full, supple, soft body with lactose creaminess – and sweetness on top of the malt sweetness.  Becomes highly aromatized very quickly, by tropical hops (mango) but even more so by vanilla (love it) and most predominantly so by the coconut; some light and late powdery bitterness lingers, but creamy lactose sweetness and coconut last for a long(er) time.  This is about as decadent as it gets in the vast IPA world, but I seem to have a thing for milkshake IPAs if they are well done, and that certainly is the case here.  This kind of desserty sweetness was unthinkable in any IPA as little as ten years ago, but here we are – products like this are bound to attract a large audience, and frankly I would like to see an adventurous Belgian brewery tackle this offspring of the ubiquitous New England IPA (the only one who has successfully done a milkshake IPA in this country so far that I know of, is Totem, so hopefully others will follow).\n",

      "J'avais une certaine appréhension en decapsulant cette Westmalle double tant la triple est pour moi un graal absolu et tant le style des doubles est un style compliqué. J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur. Un manque d'envolée lyrique qui nous empêche une parfaite élévation spirituelle, mais une double bien faîte et agréable.\n",

      "Beautifully fresh (2 month for an American beer in HK is a luxury), it's even better than I remembered. Although they write APA, this is rather a NEIPA, pours hazy orange, soapy head, not much of lacing. Nose of tropical fruits, grapefruit and grass. Tastes bitter, minor malts are overwhelmed by fresh fruity Citra hops. Smooth and highly pleasant, ale.\n",

Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pleasant enough but a bit dull in comparison to other Offshoots I've had.\n",

      "Te beczki sa jeszcze ladniejsze i faktycznie jest wiecej wanilii... duzo slodyczy... duzo kandyzowanych owocow, krowki. mniej alko niz w b2 podstawki, ale tez duzo mniej pelne odczucie w uscie... niewatpliwie klasa spora, ale tez kapke mieszanych uczuc.\n",
      "Clear, dark red brown, light beige froth. Dark, malty aroma, chocolate, dark caramel, a little coffee. Caramel and coffee flavour, late roasted notes. Sweet, quite drinkable.Earlier Rating: 12/9/2016 Total Score: 2Cloudy brown, small light beige head. Malty, caramely aroma. Caramel and brown sugar flavour. Has some roasted notes and something like cola. Not my idea of a Baltic Porter.\n",
      "Cloudy golden, thick white head. Wheaty aroma, yeast and little citrus. Yeasty, fruity flavour, a little orange. slightly floral, perfumy.\n",
      "Clear dark brown, light beige head. Malty aroma, a little roast, a little caramel, yeasty notes. Bittersweet flavour, roast, light jammy notes with a light saison touch in the finish.\n",
      "Tap @Hansens. Hazy orangy, white head. Fruity aroma, light spicy note. fruity flavour, malt an a little spicy note. Creamy, fluffy mouthfeel.\n",
      "Northern English double NEIPA, from tap at Bar Beenhouwer in Ghent.  Egg-white, membrane-lacing, creamy, thin, irregularly edged and eventually all but dissolving head, cloudy yolk-yellow robe with pale orangey tinge – the whole thing quickly looks like a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.  Aroma of mandarin, mango, ripe pineapple juice, sweetish with a sourish edge, fizzily carbonated; soft doughy malt body, completely drenched in dank, very sultry, tropical hoppiness, sweet-citrusy and a bit mango-like, but with a powdery, weedy bitterishness in the end as well – though eventually more bitterness comes from wodka-like alcohol, emphasizing an overall effect I can only describe as Screwdriver-like.  Typical new wave double NEIPA, mimicking orange juice with wodka poured in.\n",
      "Chardonnay barrel aged, light ‘session’ sour, from a waxed bomber bought at Geers in Oostakker near Ghent.  Thin and loose, mousy, bubbly, snow white head disappearing completely in the end, misty pale yellowish straw blonde robe with lime-greenish tinge.  Aroma of diluted lemon juice, indeed Chardonnay wine and white grape skin, green apple, soap, buttermilk, lime, dough, fried ‘courgette’, pumice.  Restrained fruity esters (green banana, green apple) in a softly lactic-sour, minerally environment, softly carbonated, with a soapy wheatiness and cereally main maltiness in the middle; drying lactic sourness in the end too, but remaining fairly gentle, while wood tannins from the barrels remain all but absent.  Still, the finish does bring a notable white wine flavour, which in the end adds some complexity to the whole; lots of chalkiness lingering too, though.  Soft sour ‘afterburn’.  Fruity, not lacking in complexity but it does lack in the promised Brett and wood effects, even if the Chardonnay is certainly there.  Feels like a Berliner Weisse with a dash of Chardonnay thrown in, and that is probably not that far removed from the truth.  Interesting, but too expensive for what it is and delivering only half of what it promises.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy yellow color with white head. Aroma is exotic fruits, mineraly, dank, fresh. Taste is the same. Oily mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Quite nice!\n",
      "Tap. Hazy orange color with white head. Aroma is gummybears, a bit piney, petrol. Taste is the same. Silky mouthfeel with sparkly carbonation. Quite amazing for this ABV.\n",
      "Tap. Unclear golden color with white head. Aroma is cheesy, gummybears, white sugar. Taste is the same. Oily mouthfeel with low carbonation. Not great unfortunately.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy golden color with white head. Aroma is piney, pale malts, sticky hops, resinous, peach. Taste is the same. Thick oily mouthfeel with low carbonation. Quite sweet.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy golden color with white head. Aroma is herbal, juniper, gin indeed. Taste is herbal, juniper, all the botanicals. Oily mouthfeel with low carbonation. Well-made!\n",

      "Draft. A dark brown beer with a lazing brown head. The aroma has notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee, leading to a bitter finish.\n",
      "Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.  Rich, chocolate and coffee aroma.  Almost black when poured, with a beige head that dissipates quickly to form a collar.  Medium body and carbonation.  Chocolate comes through in the taste with a good amount of bitterness to finish.  Smashing brew.\n",
      "Perfectly clear deep copper and almost amber coloured body with a decent two centimetre tall, very soapy white head that fades to literally nothing on top - just like a soda - pretty bad, actually. Aroma of wheat, bubble gum, oranges, a dash of curacao and some softer earthy and malt components that make this okay, but not great, in the nose, at least. Light to Medium-bodied; Strong wheatie and yeastie flavours dominate with a large cardboardie and funky flavour at first that shows some light orange and curacao notes, a dash of citrus, a little grain and some more assertive sugars that show caster sugar notes and a slight touch of fruit-based sugars. Aftertaste shows the more dry and slighlty softer flavours from the malt with a dry and orangey finish that has some light sweetness, but mostly the stale or funky wheat-based malt profile that doesn't have any complexities or depth from the yeast strain at all. Overall, a pretty poor beer overall, and definitely not a respectable FILTERED wheat beer as this definiteliy shows as a Wheat Ale, and even then, not a good one with bad/old wheat notes, no real yeast depth and no other complexities from other notes - just the wheat shows through, in a not-so-good way. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Knightly Spirits in Orlando (Orange Blossom Trail), Florida on 28-December-2017 for US$2,29 sampled just over two years later at home in Washington on 04-February-2020.\n",
      "Draft. A hazy red beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of berries and malt. The flavor is very sweet with notes of berries, citrus fruits, and malt, leading to a dry finish.\n",
      "Very dark mahogany, generous loose foam and berries on the nose. Rich and full in the mouth, then drying with a bitter, slightly acrid note coming in.\n",
      "Deep mahogany with a loose head. Treacle toffee and on the nose. Rich and roasty-sweet, warming, though a bit cloying and burnt on the finish.\n",
      "KØLF 291119. Black color with a brown head. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate. Flavor is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, sugar, caramel, lactose, salt, licorice, tonka beans. Very nice beer.\n",
      "Cask at GBBF Winter 2020, red-brown and lightly hazy, a fine crema and a sweetish nose with a winey hint. Sweet with an oddly astringent finish.\n",
      "Aroma : Roasted chocolate malt, light coconut touch and a hint of burnt wood.  Taste : Coconut is not especially evident in the taste; it gets lost in the lovely roasted chocolate malt. Nice bitter sweet balance; a decent porter (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep red, a touch of fruit and sweet coffee on the nose. Sweet and burnt, a bit cloying.\n",
      "750-ml bottle from mousetrap. gushed but expectedly so didn't lose much, good smooth-on-top beautiful-from-the-side loudly fizzy head, arcs of lace, beautiful hazy reddish syrup color, wild malty nose, full body, berry, yogurt, tart, perfectly balanced, bready finish. rating #1!\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours black with a small light brown head. Aroma reveals hearty oats upfront, with gentle roast and a nice earthiness. Flavour is very hearty, with lots of hearty oats, a touch of coffee, and medium roast. Rounded and deep, with good drinkability. How I want my oatmeal stout to be. What the hell are you on about, Dean? Very good.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy dull blonde with a small whit shear. Aroma reveals lots of coriander, gentle salt, and citric notes. Flavour reveals plenty of coriander and yogurty lacto upfront, with plenty of citrus and moderate salt. Quite citric and spicy on the finish. Decently made.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy dark red with a small beige head. Aroma is full of jammy berries, moderate pith, and some lacto. Flavour is very fruity, with mixed red berries, lots of lacto, and a hint of sweetness. Quite pithy and tart. Fun beer, but not very complex.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear copper golden with a small beige head. Aroma brings out bitter piney hops and crisp biscuity malt, in west good coast fashion. Flavour is quite bitter, with plenty of bright, biting piney hops, a little grass, and crisp biscuity malt. Nice to image a proper west coast IPA amidst all the hazy these days. Piney and crisp. Nothing mind-blowing, just very well-made.\n",

      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear pale golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out a very peppery spiced character with little else discernible. Flavour is along the same lines, with grassy notes, a herbal character, and crisp biscuity malt. Herbal and spicy. It’s alright.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy dull golden with a small white head. Aroma is full of lacto upfront, with everything else taking a backseat - there’s some floral hops in there, but they’re drowned out by the yogurt. Flavour is more balanced between the lacto and hops, with harsh floral hops and lots of yogurt. Not overly well-integrated, but it’s a fun one.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy bronze with a small white head. Aroma reveals earthy coffee upfront, with little of the base beer discernible. Flavour is along the same lines, with earthy coffee and a bready malt base. The coffee is nice, albeit very simple. Okay beer.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out sweet candied sugar and estery notes. Flavour is estery and sweet, with a pretty chaotic profile of cotton candy, booze, and out-of-control esters. Not properly brewed. Difficult to drink.\n",
      "On tap in the brewpub as \"Canary Cross Amber\". Aroma : light caramel & cereal malts, hint of indistinct red fruit hop.  Taste : Specific flavours don't really come through, but has a light sweet malt feel nicely balanced by a light bittering, not horrible just a tad boring (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear yellowish blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out dank hops, with almost a sourness to it - lots of weed. Flavour is quite dank and vibrant, with lots of citrus hops, earthy notes, dankness, and crisp dry biscuity malt. Dank, dry and vibrant. Very good.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is rather dusty, with earthy hops, sawdust, and cereal malt. Flavour is less vibrant than hoped for a mosaic IPA, with earthy hops, bready malt, and some gentle tropical fruits. Again, not as bright as hoped for. Decent but could be better dialled in.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out an earthy hop character, with some onion, and some juicy fruit pith. Flavour is more or less the same, with herbal and piney hops, earthy notes, and onion. Not as vibrant as the Sabro I just had, but the clarity is solid. Good stuff\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out fresh piney hops, some resins, and tropical pithy fruits. Flavour has great clarity, with bright tropical fruits, lots of pithy hops, and some sticky resins. So juicy and with great clarity. Excellent.\n",
      "Can. Clear gold with moderate whitehead. Taste crisp mouthfeel, white grape, hint of grapefruit and orange. Moderate bitterness and medium-light sweetness. Clean dry finish.\n",
      "12-oz can from binnys Lincoln Park. huge multi-bubbled foamy head, huge chocolate nose, creamy medium body, chocolate milk, boozy, sweet, roasty finish. rating #1!\n",
      "Hazy light amber appearance with a beige head. Aroma of toasted malt, bread, fruity esters, mild herbs and light banana. Similar flavor, malty and yeasty sweetness with mild fruit and a light spicy bitterness. Medium body with a soft feel and smooth finish.\n",
      "Bottled, 330ml from the Thornbridge Brewery Shop, Bakewell, Derbys. Gold to amber with white head. This has quite an assertive resinous bitterness from the off, hoppy, sharp in character. Dry grapefruit flavours, lemon rind, grass, pine needles. Very pleasant.\n",
      "Light caramel & corn malt, hint of lemon citrus hopLight sweet caramel malt, grain/cereal, and some citrus note. Light and refreshing but nothing special\n",
      "\n",
      "Poured from a 16 oz can dated January 28, 2020. \n",
      "Aroma is fairly hop forward with light cracker malt notes and a hint of alcohol spice. Tropical fruit, citrus and light resin notes. Mango, passion fruit, tangerine and orange notes. \n",
      "Pours a fairly clear, golden orange with a large, frothy, pillowy, white head that recedes slowly to a small film that lingers on the edges. Moderately high lacing and faint legs. \n",
      "Flavor is slightly sweet with medium light cracker malt notes and a hint of caramel. Strong bitterness with faint alcohol notes. Moderatel hop notes of grapefruit, resin, orange and mango. \n",
      "Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, a decent West Coast style IPA. Solid bitterness with decent hop notes and a bit of a background character.\n",

      "Can from Joe’s enjoyed after returning from Flint.  Pours a light gold color with a white head. Big aroma of lemony citrus plus sweetness. The flavor is almost like pineapple juice with light pithy bitterness. Kind of an overall brut streak too. Okay.\n",
      "Tap at Belmont Station. Colour..ruby red with no head. Nose...essence of cherry compote,  kirschwasser and vanilla cream with hints of maraschino juice. Palate...a quick assault of tart cherry tang and then waves of sweet cherry purée dance across the palate. The gleek fest begins at the mid palate and is highly pronounced at the back with plenty of acetic goodness. The finish is laced with vanilla notes and is also long, tart and bittersweet.\n",
      "Poured from a 16 oz can dated January 28, 2020. \n",
      "Aroma is very hop forward and fruity with lots of mango, passion fruit, mango, lychee and some over ripe fruit. Light dank, resin notes. Light cracker malt notes and a hint of alcohol. \n",

      "Hazy plum pour, relatively abundant head. Marvelous blueberry aroma, some funk, some wood. Bracingly tart at first, but the palate acclimates. Full-bodied. Lots of blueberry character. Almost sweet after a while. Modest but notable wine. A dark chocolate pairing is not bad. Good beer.\n",
      "Box pour @ home. Pours an opaque dark rich dark cherry red with no head. Nose is loaded with tart cherries and gentle funk. Flavour is unsweetened cherry juice in a pleasant way, tart cherries, and a touch of funk in the background. Medium to light bodied, no carbonation, and a light sweetness with a mild acidity. Lovely stuff, and it keeps me going back for more. Love that I can have this in the fridge for a glass a day sort of thing.\n",
      "16oz can c/o BenT. Big, foamy, white head atop a filtered yellow-tan body.  Fast rising carbonation bubbles within.  Smooth, easy, medium bodied.  Doesn't lean into the corn that much, and the filtration keeps it clean.  OK.\n",
      "Can from Berrmoth, Manchester. Black pour with a light tan head. Butterscotch, burnt caramel, chocolate , toffee aroma.Taste is sweet tobacco, toasted coconut, chocolate, iquorice toffee.Thick sweet boozy finish.\n",
      "From a 16 oz can into a stem glass.  pours gold with small head.  Aroma of a lime soda.  Significant carbonation and mouthfeel.  Flavors of grains, minerals, lime juice, slight sweetener, subtle hops.  Overall light, refreshing, OK for the style if you're looking for something tart and light.\n",
      "Tallboy, Food City, Maryville, TN. Big, persistent tan head on a very dark pour. Inviting aroma full of cocoa, whiskey and dark, dried fruit. A bit acidic, pruney, peaty, woody and boozy, assertively bitter, faintly astringent, not too sweet, roasty.  Body is on the slightly heavy side, the beer is warming, the carbo retention is good. This is a clean and powerful pint. ABV is apparent, but blends well with the overall brew. Solid.\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from a six-pack brought back from Raley's in Chico, CA.  The aroma is distinctly SN with a clear airiness and a touch of toasted malt with a very light salty top note.   The smell really reminded me of another SN beer which I tried to figure out and I think it's Flipside or Ruthless Rye.  Beautiful crystal clear golden yellow topped with a very fine-bubbled white head.  Lots of hop bitterness right up front in the taste, but not a heavy, cloying bitterness.   Some earthy and citrus pith in the main taste and a more biting dry leaf bitterness on the tongue.  Really interesting mix of hops here.  This is all balanced by a signature caramel sweetness that really ties the taste together and makes this an easy drinking and refreshing beer.  Medium-bodied and slightly creamy.  Finishes with a lasting tongue coating bitterness and toasted malt aftertaste.  Excellent recipe for an anniversary brew.  Happy 40th, Sierra Nevada!\n",
      "The Aromas are tart fruit and cereal. Flavors are similar to nose with balanced mild sweet tart upfront with a little rotten fruit. Decent carbonation in body but the Finish is a little off. .\n",
      "It's good. No unwanted tastes or flavors that I notice. 15 pack for $14.50 before tax.\n",
      "12 oz can.  Pours golden with some fine particles, but otherwise clear, and a white head.  Aroma is light, but what's there is still distinctively of Centennial hops (floral, herbal, grapefruit) as in Two Hearted.  Flavor light as well, of course, but again herbal and floral hops with a bit of grapefruit, a bit of biscuit.  Also has the right amount of bitterness for the strength.  This is quite good given how light it has to be, but that lightness prevents me from enjoying it enough to give it a higher score.\n",
      "473ml can. Pours a cloudy orange-yellow with a thin, fizzy, short lived, white head that leaves spotty lacing.  Sweet aroma of caramel malt, lemon, oak and Brett. Sweet fruity flavour of caramel malt, green apple, pear, lemon, Brett and oak in a dry, sour Lacto finish. Medium body with a sticky texture and average carbonation. Enjoyable and well made.\n",

      "Bottle. Pours opaque black with a creamy medium brown head that dissipates leaving good residual and lacing. Aroma is strong espresso, mocha notes, light vanilla. Flavor is medium sweet, medium bitter, really heavy espresso. Full body, creamy mouthfeel, lingering heat. Very nice coffee stout, but the bourbon barreling is lost in the shuffle here, unfortunately.\n",
      "Pours thick black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is cocoa, lactose and roast.  Taste is rich chocolate and lactose, moving to roast and some earthy notes.  Finish is chocolate milk and roast.  Tasty stout.\n",
      "Pours cola black with a small off white fizz.  Aroma is chocolate and roasted malts.  Taste is slightly thin but considering it is a session, it's acceptable.  Roasted malts and some chocolate with some light coffee.\n",
      "Can, courtesy of Ben. Pours a bright hazy orange. Tangerine, floral, lemon, blueberry, little hop spice. Good body. Good.\n",
      "16 oz can pours a clear pale golden with small fizzy head that vanishes in a few seconds without leaving any lacing.  Aroma may have passionfruit and hemp seed, but reminds me more of Jolly Ranchers.  Taste is sweet, more like a soda than a malt liquor, with hardly any booziness.  Body is medium with lively carbonation.  It fails as a beer but succeeds as something to get you buzzed quickly if you don't like the taste of normal beer.\n",
      "Can from The Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours dark brn/blk with a huge foamy Guinness tan head. Pours like Guinness! Nitro like. Aroma of dark chocolate and somewhat toasty malt escapes the foam. Med plus body. Flavor is slightly burnt malt, chocolate and hints of darker fruits. I think it's pretty dry. Bitter arguably comes from the malt. It's a very nice drink.\n",
      "Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.  Overall: too sour, too little going on, and I'm not convinced the cherries or poppies are doing anything.\n",
      "Draft at Cugino’s, served in a smaller glass. Pours a hazy gold with a small white head that settles into a thin ring and small island of film. Notes of tangerine, florals, vanilla, sweet and bready malts, stone fruits, herbs, and resin. Faint boozy warmth. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a citrusy, sweet, bitter mouthfeel in pretty good balance. Nice entry into the Fallen Flag series.\n",
      "Pours a deep, oily black, with mid-sized, tan head. Aroma of roasted grain, some nuts, chocolate. Flavor follows, with a light sweetness. This is pretty good.\n",
      "Draft at Cugino’s, served in a smaller glass. Pours a deep, semi-cloudy brownish amber with a small off-white head that settles into a ring and island of film, leaving plenty of ropes of lace in the glass. Notes of toasty and slightly smoky malts, chocolate, tobacco, earth, brown sugar, and tea. Light-bodied, with modest carbonation and a malty, toasty, semi-sweet mouthfeel. Nice.\n",
      "Dark brown body with amber highlights and no head, roasty malty nose, flavor is pretty sweet, lots of residual sugars, Dark roasted malts, finish is all black malt, well bittered\n",
      "12 oz. tall can. Pours a pale ale color, with a bit of pink peeping in. Fizzy sparkling wine head but a bit more persistent. Does have a chardonnay nose to it. The taste does bring up ideas of rosé wine, and the sparkle doesn't hurt at all. The dry red wine taste continues to the red; not overly \"winey,\" but well matched to the beer background.\n",
      "16 ounce can. Hazy orange gold pour. Small creamy beige head. Dank citrus hop nose. Flavor follows nose, with lots of sharp citrus character. Notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, passion fruit and spring onions. Warming alcohol in middle. Dank resiny pine finish is long and bitter.\n",
      "Draft at Cugino’s, served in a smaller glass. Pours a clear gold with a finger of white head that settles into a thick ring and thin half film. Notes of wheat, dough, clove, banana, lemon, and some residual sweetness. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, malty mouthfeel. True to style.\n",
      "Can from H-E-B. Bright orange. Strong citrus and tropical aroma. Orange, tangy, very mildly bitter finish.\n",

      "Bottle shared at bowling opaque black with moderate tan head. Nose bourbon, coffee, mineral chocolate. Taste coffee, molasses, almost maple, mineral chocolate. Light bourbon.\n",
      "Pours clear yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of grassy malt. Taste has fantastic rich malt, grassy hops that persist on the tongue. Palate has smoked malt on the tongue and nose. Je ne seis quoi.\n",
      "Sort of a pale amber colour, bright, but lifeless, with no head. I have to say I agree with Dean here - I've known people who drink only ghetto white and this comes across that way. Like a ghetto white mixed with some flabby malts. On the palate, I like it better. It still has a bit of that cheap white character, but that vinous note is a bit snappier, as the acidity comes in a touch. Still some biscuity unfermented malt that leaves a bit too much of an impact, but it's better on the palate.\n",
      "500 ml bottle from the brewery (as Everything Goes Away with Southern Star & Amarillo).  Pours a very murky peach colour with moderate-sized off-white head.  Aroma is dank pine, orange, other citrus fruit and some green hop character.  Flavour has big dank, green character with lots of pine, orange and lychee.  Fairly bitter in the finish.  Medium-full body.  Nice.\n",
      "16 oz can from Brewers Haven.  Light haze on the pour, fluffy head fades. Fruity aroma, heavy on the tropical. Taste also is tropical, with a heavy dryness. Sweet and not that bitter\n",
      "Pours hazy, light head with a tropical aroma. Smooth from start to finish. Not too bitter. Just right. Cheers!!!\n",
      "12oz can at home via WY, thanks iphonephan!  Clear golden amber with a medium white head with good retention and lacing.  Lemon and orange citrus, piney and grassy hops, some bready malt.  Medium carb and body with a smooth texture and a lingering, bittering finish.  Excellent.\n",
      "Cask pour at Side Project Cellar. Pours a cloudy brick red with a cascading khaki head that settles into a ring and island of film. Notes of balsamic, some acidity, cherries, brown sugar, oak, raspberries, and funk. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and an acidic, sharp mouthfeel. Has some pucker. Very good overall.\n",
      "500 ml bottle from Tavour. Nose is sweet honey, tart apples, and hints of bubblegum. Murky yellow gold with a small white head. Flavor is moderately sweet with a hint of tartness. Flavor is sweet honey, slightly tart apples, and a possibly imaginary hint of cinnamon.\n",
      "Vintage bottle shared by alexsdad06 pour opaque black with thin tan head. Nose light bourbon and molasses, light caramel, light earthy. Taste raisin, molasses, light barrel, molasses.\n",
      "Wow. Great oatmeal stout. Strong roasted malt aroma. Perfect dark and foreboding color. Flavors were full with a silky body.\n",
      "Bottle from Total Wine. Black with a big, thick lacing tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, cocoa, rye, wood, coffee, and vanilla. Rich, roasty, sweet and a little boozy. Full bodied and smooth. Very nice.\n",
      "bomber from 2018; so aged a little - good gingerbread aroma. dark pour of course; not much gingerbread in flavor but some holiday spices in flavor.  med. palate.  base stout is average.  ok brew\n",

Notes of passionfruit, raspberry, guava, lime, floral zest, wheat, salt, and coriander. Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation and a fruity, tart, zesty mouthfeel. Really tasty.\n",
      "Can. Opaque and yellowish. On the nose, this is fairly assertive with lots of grapefruit and gooseberry stuff. The Sauvin is pretty big here. On the palate, it has quite a light body, and then big, bright Nelson accents, lots of subtropical bright fruits. Low bitterness. Hits the hazy style in a really nice way.\n",

We're listening to Balthazar - Rats. Think is excellent, smoke (lots of) but smooth and easy drinking. Sweet and even a little fish edge also some smoked honey.

Fruity nose and flavors - papaya, pineapple, sweet mango, but also an odd note of old apricots. Low carb, light body.  Sweet finish, very lightly hopped.  Ok.\n",
      "Cans from GS brew pub store, neat label. Pours a golden amber with a creamy head. Smooth delicate and fresh - citrus peel and grass and smooth malt and candy citrus/pale fruit. Nice mingling citrus flavors in the finish, kind of like 3-fruit marmalade but with a snappy fresh dryness. What balance. Aroma has a whiff of the freshest mandarin.\n",

      "Kinda sweet and simple, and a little flabby, but not too bad.\n",
      "Lightly cloudy golden with a fading white head. Lightly briney citrusy limey aroma with some mango and light soursop. Nice gently tart limey and mango salty flavor that’s not too heavy on the salt but has a nice salinic undertone.\n",
      "Can shared by alexsdad06 pour clear gold with moderate white head. Nose macerated fruit, dank, light grass. Taste similar to nose, lots of fruit. Surprisingly no grass or onion.\n",
      "Can (10/29/19) pour. Appearance is orange-yellow with tons of effervescent sparkle, finger-width foamy white head with decent retention and mildest lacing. Aroma is strong, sweet fruit, spicy. Taste is passionfruit, citrus bite. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, lively carbonation (biting the tongue), hint of alcohol warmth deep in the esophagus and finish as taste. Overall, strong and enjoyable aroma and flavor but not complex. Hops just out of peak freshness so may be better fresh.\n",
      "16 oz. can shared by drsordr. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium plus sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale malts, lightly toasted, mild sweetness, citrus and earthy hops, grass, some onion character but this is a well put together beer, I am always cautious with 100% Mosaic hopped beers but this was very good.\n",
      "Can pours a super clear, bright golden color with a big fluffy white head that lingers leaving curtains of lace on glass. Smells of citrus fruit, bread herbs, perfume and pine. Taste of sweet bread, grapefruit, lemon bread, and resin. Light body, super carbonated, soft mouthfeel and a dry finish. Crisp, clean, dry and tasty! Superb!\n",
      "16 oz can from Joe Canal's, 2/4/20.  Hazy gold, white head, strong lace.  Grapefruit, pineapple, melon, and a little apricot.  Nice juicy flavor, solidly sweet, mildly bitter.  Pretty nice.\n",

      "12 oz. can purchased at Molly's Spirits in Lakeside, CO. Thanks G-unit! Pours a cloudy apple sauce color with a large white head that exploded all over the counter. Very good retention. Almost no lacing. Tropical fruit aroma.  Strong wheat ale base beer with some undefined tropical fruit flavors. A little sour? This is more of a wheat ale than a fruit beer. Just not working for me. Sounded good,  but a miss.\n",

      "Pours barely translucent apricot with a thick and frothy ivory head. Aroma delivers resiny hops, crisp fresh malt, tropical and citrus fruit with a hint of apple. Flavor offers piney and somewhat bitter hops, zesty, tart and sweet fruit - orange, tropical, grapefruit, a whisper of apple - with fresh malt providing the foundation. Texture yields firm body and peppy fizz, and a woody hop finish. Everybody must get Greenstone.\n",

      "4-pack of 16 oz. cans from Marketplace Foods.  $9.99  Pours a relatively clear deep golden color with a nice white head, but the beer appears to be unfiltered as there is some yeast sediment at the bottom of the can.  The aroma is clean with a slight bit of aromatic hops.  The flavor is more of hop oil than of malt, but a pretty good balance.  Overall a nice flavorful beer and not overdone as are so many.\n",

      "This stout poured a deep black colour with a huge, creamy brown head. Beautiful lacing. Scents include light coffee, nuts, roasted malts and smoke. First swig was bold. Really bold. Heavy roasted flavour with tastes of pure coffee grounds and light smoke. Not very sweet, but those roasted malts are delicious. Finish is pure burnt with that dark roast coffee flavours lingering forever.\n",

      "Bottle - American strong might be the best overall classification for this, but it reads really British in character to me - hazy ruby - rich earthy (maybe some golden promise and marris) sweet malt similar to a scotch ale - moderate spiciness, dark bread, caramelized sugars - moderate bitterness, more American in character, finishes - hearty and warming - very good.\n",

Sweet-ish, chocolately dark malty and spicy aroma, notes of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate sauce, some vanilla, cinnamon, peppery spicy and minimally smoky whiffs of chipotle. Taste is sweet, chocolately dark malty and spicy, notes of cinnamon and vanilla, peppery spicy, minimally smoky notes of chipotle bring that typical effect of increasing, accumulating hotness. Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, completely hidden alcohol. Exactly what it wants to be (Mexican Hot Chocolate) but not in an Imperial way; spiciness really pushes the envelope without crossing the line to discomfort. Pretty good.\n",
      "16-ounce can purchased in January 2020 with an ABV of 8.7. Pours hazy yellow-gold with a 1/4\" bubbly beige head and residual lacing. Aroma: citrus. Flavor: grapefruit, lemon, orange, pineapple, mango, pine. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied, a slick to oily finish.\n",
      "On tap at the Only Cafe.  Pours a clear golden colour with plus-sized white head.  Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits with some sweet maltiness.  Flavour is orange, grapefruit and floral happiness with sweet biscuity maltiness.  Modest bitterness in finish.  Nice.\n",

      "This radler poured a cloudy, medium yellow colour with a ultra, fizzy, Bright white, carbonated head. Minimal lacing. Scents include A little bit of peach, must and dough. First swig was quite thin and watery with flavours of light peach, club soda and must. Finish is very light with that minimal peach flavour lingering slightly.\n",
      "Bottle.  Cloudy amber coloured beer with a strong white head.  The aroma is yeasty and bitter, and the flavour is strongly bitter with yeastiness and a dry finish.  Overall a nice beer.\n",
      "Gifted to me. Pours nearly clear yellow with almost no head and no lacing, just a ring. Aromas are sweet and citrus-pithy. Flavors follow, only mild bitterness, but I just don't enjoy that pith note. Very smooth, with a surprisingly light mouthfeel. It's okay, but glad I only have one.\n",
      "HG came baking the biscuits. HG came breaking the barriers. HG broke down the walls and stole all the bread from the bakery.\n",
      "Bottle from the no-longer-open Brewklopedia, Leicester. Hazy and slightly pinkish yellow with the tiniest ring of white head. Nasal passages are slightly burned by the intense tartness to the aroma. Lemon juice, raspberry, intense mothball funk. Amazing mouth-puckering taste. The sourness fills the whole mouth and longer a long after the sip. More lemon and tart berry in the aftertaste. Medium to heavy carbonation. Special.\n",

      "440ml can from We Brought Beer, Balham.  Clear deep golden.  Aroma is piney and with a certain crispness.  It’s quite malty and quite crisp.  Kind of ticks all the boxes of west coast, but without really ticking them.  This means that it is actually more quintessential than you think. ￼\n",
      "Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. \n",
      "\n",
      "The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.\n",

      "Can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom. 11-20-19 canning. Pushing the limits on hop freshness on this one! But it all works out in the end! Aroma: bold tropical fruit, soft malt. Flavor has strong tropical fruit, mild grassy, and a light malt backbone. Clearly the best beer I ever had from this brewery. Glad they finally stepped up their game!\n",

      "[33cl can from M&S, Bracknell.] A hazy pale straw coloured pour with a fast fading, soapy looking white head; berry fruit aroma; fruity, biscuity body; with a sharp fruity bitterness and a vegetal finish. Odd.\n",
      "4/2/2020. Growler sample courtesy of danlo, cheers Ed! Great looking pour, almost black with a nice size light tan coloured head. Aroma of dark chocolate, chocolate orange, light roasted malt, caramel, coffee, dried fruit and a touch of liquorice. Medium sweetness and light to moderate bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Very nice.\n",
      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",
      "330ml Can from Asda, Enniskillen (£1.50):\n",
      "Light & clear amber a thin, bubbly white lacing that fades fast & leaves a clean, slightly skunky nose with some pale malts, faint grassy notes & a touch of lemon. The taste is bitter & skunky with faint grassy hops & hay coming through alongside bread malts but not much else. The body is light, clean & lightly carbonated but quite sharp at the end too. \n",

Aroma of light whiskey, wood, citrus, berries, apple, funky notes and a hint of marzipan. Moderate sweetness and medium tartness. Medium body, oily texture, a bit above average carbonation. Enjoyable.\n",
      "Pours a clear, golden amber coloration with a small, creamy, stable head. Smells of sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with just a hint of actual coffee. Taste is very much dominated by sweet, doughy malt, coffee cream and vanilla, with some hazelnut also coming through, as well as just a hint of coffee and white chocolate. Finishes almost sickly sweet, with some coffee cream and vanilla lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this does an ok job at imitating a White Russian, it's just way too syrupy sweet and creamy/milky for an enjoyable Imperial Stout, with the vanilla being way overdone and very little coffee coming through. While the mouthfeel is all right, I expected more from a nitro can. Nobody loves the Big Lebowski more than me, but this does not tie it together very well at all, no need to be careful about this beverage. But well, you know, that's just like, my opinion man.\n",
      "440ml Can from Asda, Enniskillen (£1.50):\n",
      "Bright amber & hazy with a thin head that's frothy white. The nose is sharp with plenty citrus & dry hops, orange & grapefruit. It's not as strong as expected for the strength but the taste is slightly more pronounced with lots of citrus & orange, grapefruit & bitter pine hops. The alcohol content is masked well & it's fairly easy to drink too, with moderate carbonation & a slightly warming finish.\n",
      "16 oz can from Joe Canal's, 2/4/20.  Canned 12/5/19.  Pours a murky yellowish color, decent off-white head, moderate lace.  Aroma is lemon-lime, grass, pale malts, and a little dough.  Some light citrus notes as well.  Flavor is thin overall, with lemon and pale malts coming through with a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness.  None of the juicy brightness or hop bitterness for that matter that you'd expect from the listed hops, just kind of a thin, watery hoppy blonde ale thing going.  Lively mouthfeel, somewhat dry close.  Feels like either they missed the mark or this is one of those IPAs where if it's more than a month old all the flavor is gone.  Either way, it's mediocre.  \n",

      "Light, bright amber with a clear body & white, foamy head that holds well. The nose is hoppy with pine & faint citrus but it's definitely subdued. The taste is similarly subdued & slightly off with bitter hop oils, citrus & faint grapefruit. Its a light bodied beer with a smooth, sharp feel but its too light for the most part & a little disappointing.\n",

      "650ml bottle shared with brother at my place. Thanks for the share Guillaume. Aroma: lots of bourbon, rye too (I know there is no rye), light Cuban cigar, shy roasted malt, lots of chocolate. App: black, thick texture, minimal to no brown head, thick brown lacing. Taste and palate: full body, thick, medium sweetness, roasted bitter finish. Overall: love the nose of this beer. It reminds me of the nose of most of the Alesmith Speedway variants (BASS, BAVSS). The palate is rather sweet but still really easy to drink even if shared with only one person. Great.\n",
      "330ml Can from Asda, Enniskillen (£1.50):\n",
      "Caramel amber & a tiny, hazy head that's frothy white head but very thin. It's a sharp, hoppy nose with pine hops & light citrus, herbal touches & floral notes too with some caramel to finish. It's a perfume taste with floral flavours, grassy hops &  pine before sweet malts see things out. The body is medium & dry with a subtle tang at the end; it's an interesting beer but nothing special.\n",

Big roasted barley, liquorice, coffee and a slightly sharp fruity berry note in the nose, quite full in the mouth with a slight creamy sweetness, some blackcurrant fruitiness that becomes slightly tart, hints of bitter coffee and some liquorice notes. Finish has a dry roasted barley bitterness, some sweetness, and a slightly fruity liquorice note lingering.\n",

      "Very lemony, lots of citrus notes. Enough funk to let you know that this is a real mixed ferm and not another kettle sour, but a lot of lacto notes and it lacks the complexity of some mixed fermentation beers. This is what I'd give to a kettle sour fan who hadn't gotten into real sours yet. Not terrible, but I'm probably not buying it again.\n",

      "750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew. Fantastic. Lives up to all the hype in spite of everything. Who doesn't love that? Founders certainly knows something about brewing beer. Thanks a million. Well done!\n",

      "A 22 fl. oz. bomber with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter glass. It was dark brown to black in colour with a very thin brown head that disappeared almost immediately and left only sparse lacing. Aromas of whiskey, roasty, chocolate, with hints of oak, molasses and vanilla. Tastes of sweet bourbon whiskey, roasty, chocolate, molasses, and oak, with notes of vanilla and caramel and maybe even some char. Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, although perhaps a little sweet for me, the roast and chocolate did mostly balance it out for me, and it was still an enjoyable sipper.\n",

      "Pours a cloudy, ruby red coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smells of tart rasperry and zesty lime, with a distinct acidity. Taste is a great balance of slightly sweet and quite tart raspberry and rather zesty lime, with a good lactic acidity and light salinity. Finishes with a medium tartness and some raspberry and lime lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and mesium carbonation.\n",

      "A rather nice Gose that is recognizable as the style despite being flavored, with a good lactic acidity, subtle saltiness and very little sweetness coming through. The raspberry and lime work together rather well, forming a very enjoyable flavor profile. Very crisp and refreshing, makes for a great summer beer.\n",

Great stuff overall, definitely one of the better BBNo hoppy beers I have had recently. Has light sweetness, pleasant pithy citrus, only a whisper of minerality, some melon, tangerine, mild rindy bitterness, background pale malts. Light to medium bodied with fine carbonation. Nicely balanced finish, with a hint of cat pee, tropical accents, more pithy citrus. Really sound.\n",

      "Got this scary can from JRs. Was not looking forward to this tick. After all, it says it has some artificial flavors in it. Pours clear pale from a pounder can.  Smell is somewhat artificial apple, like hardtack candy. Taste is as expected, somewhat rude ass artificial apple candy with a vanilla backbone. Cannot get this. It also has a warming sensation as it goes down the gullet. Can't say I'm disjointed because I didn't expect much. I had high hopes for the Blockhouse brand but I'm afraid they are just turning into another alky laced soda pop brand. This stuff is more on the line of those kindah malt beverages, has little to do with beer, thanks. I'm going to mix the rest of this with a can of IC light to try to straighten it out a bit and make it more acceptable. Whew.\n",

      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours mostly clear gold with a frothy, pure white head. Incredible beer, with a gorgeous mix of pissy southern hemisphere hop and farmyard funk. Lightly sweet, only a little bitterness, perhaps a touch of pine and lemon rind.

      "330ml glass bottle from Seven Seasons, Hoxton. Served at cellar temperature into a stout glass. Dated as bottled on 17/05/19. \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer pours a perfect black colour developing a one and a half finger mocha colour head. Uniform with medium sized bubbles. The head settles to a thick layer before finally disappearing half way through the drink. A lovely lacing. Visually this one looks like a top beer. \n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma has an identical profile to tiramisu. Heavy dark roasted coffee. Vanilla. Woody. Muscovado. Figs. Coffee, and the woody smell of the barrel ageing are the dominant notes. Nasally stunning. \n",
      "\n",
      "The taste is where the beer deviates away from great, in my opinion. Too alcoholic. I do understand the beer is 11.5% and imperial in style, but on the tastebuds the alcohol dominates and little else is present. I feel as the only reason I can taste coffee, vanilla or oak is because of the strength of aroma leading to perception. The beer is moderately sweet. \n",
      "\n",
      "The beer feels thick in the mouth, a lot of alcohol warmth, also in the pit of the stomach. A slightly dry, moderately sweet feel. \n",

      "500 ml bottle from Tavour, 2/4/20.  2019 Reserve, Bottled 3/18/19.  Pours a darker, rusty orange color with a thick, foamy and frothy, beige head.  Strongly funky / peppery, some wood, herbal, pear, and grape notes.  Bright, tingly, and fairly tart.  A nice complexity has been developed at this point.  I could see it changing with more age, but as it is right now, it is drinking nicely.  Nicely blended.  \n",

Flavor is resinous hoppy, some caramel tones, mouthwatering citrus, hop oily slick palate, malty bitter finish. Alcohol is barely noticeable here, great balance between resinous hops and bitter malts. Great.\n",

      "Sierra Nebmvada really knows how to celebrate an anniversary. Their 40th IPA is truly a victory of brewing. It's a balanced affair that channels their west coast pedigree while still delivering interest and quality. A solid light malt backbone lifts an impressive resiny piney hop bill that is both familiar and engaging at the same time.  Nice long hoppy finish that still manages to avoid rindiness. Quite clean. Awesome lacing too. This is why they are the west coast kings.\n",
