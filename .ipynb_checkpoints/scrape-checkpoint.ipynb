      "Large off white head with good retention and a nice lace. Lightly hazy blond. Nose is mango and a little citrus. Body is medium, ain’t juicy, prickly carbo. Just some lightly sweet pale malts and lightly fruity hops. Dry, lightly bitter finish. Seems SN is trying a bit too hard. 12oz can from statelineliquors.\n",
      "Can from the brewery. Pours hazy orange/red with a thin, fizzy head. Tastes like tart citrus, berry, cookie malt, and sour yeast. Light body and low carbonation. Smells like berry, yeast, sour dough, and cookie malt.\n",
      "Pours a flat white wine, soft pear on the nose with a hint of vanilla. Flavour is very soft pear mixed with some more vanilla. Full on the mouth the alcohol is well hidden, but it's rather uninteresting.\n",
      "Pours with soft brown body and minimal foam, smells of brown sugar and those cheap halloween candies. Flavour is soft caramel and mountain due. Mouthfeel is cloying. This is a big miss for an ESB.\n",
      "On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin head that dissipates quickly and completely. Aroma has slightly dark grains with toffee, light dark berries and a bit of apple brandy underlying. Flavor has slightly dark grains and toffee with touches of apple brandy, blackberry and a hint of caramel backing.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Woodman's Appleton, 2/6/20. Murky orange, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of dank, melon, pale malt and a bit of toast. Taste is resin, melon, dank, yuzu, pale malt. Medium bodied, low bitterness.\n",
      "Pours with good beige foam on a nice black body, smells of nice sweet dark milk chocolate. Flavour is good sharp cocoa with hints of sweet barley. Nice dryness on the mouth. This is decent and filling.\n",
      "Pint at the Hurricane Oyster Bar. Pours a clear, brown color, with a small, beige head. The aroma is caramel, resin, toffee, rose, and wheat bread. Sweet and malty, with a mellow bitterness. Light to medium body, with a thin, sharp palate. Mediocre aromatics for an IPA, and pretty thin and weak. Fair.\n",
      "Can from Bottles in Providence, RI.  Very cloudy yellow-white, thin white medium-coarseness and moderate retention head.  Aroma is lovely big mango and dry mango, some dank onion, some passionfruit, some orange, touch of lime.  This smells lovely.  Medium weight, starchy semi-textured, slightly oily feel, medium-light carbonation, medium-coarseness, medium-light burn, silky.  Nice feel!  Flavor is sharp mango, bitter grapefruit, some dank herbs and onion, some orange, bit of tree sap, lingering green citrus and light rind bitterness.  Light and neutral barely balancing sweetness.  This is pretty great!\n",
      "Draft at Cellarmaker on nitro. Dark brown with a lasting tan head. Aroma is roast, coffee, cocoa, earth. Flavor is dry and super balanced. Roasty, earthy, very nice. Medium body with a very smooth feel. Hell of a mild.\n",
      "Bottle from friend. Pours brown no head or lacing. Notes are coffee, some tart cherry. No marshmallow to speak of. Taste medium bitter, medium sweet. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "500 ml bottle pours a reddish color with a small white head.  Aromas of blackberries, stone fruit, light wine.  Medium bodied, very complex, a great beer.\n",
      "Pours slightly hazy, light butterscotch. Light, hop aroma. Taste is floral, and tropical fruit, with a moderate bitter finish. It has a \"juicy\" palate. Very drinkable. (IBU not listed on can)\n",
      "Bottle from friend. Pours brown coffee some head and lacing. Notes are cinnamon, chocolate, lactose. Taste huge sweet, medium bitter. Light body lively carbonation.\n",
      "Can from friend. Well, it does what it says. Pours light brown lots of head and lacing. Nose is massive smell of butter tart. Notes are butter tarts... raisins, brown sugar, burnt butter, nutty. Taste huge sweet, light bitter. Light body lively carbonation. I think I have a cavity now.\n",

      "Brown with a foamy head that soon turns whispy. Big medicinal aroma, a cherry/raspberry blend cough syrup. Herbal too though. With a bit of time out of the bottle it really does start to smell like a PB&J. The intense peanuty note is probably the highlight of this brew. Taste is bittersweet, full of earthy peanut shell and sweet artificial cough drop. Body is medium, carbonation moderate, texture watery. Probably the most disappointing tough 50 brew I‘ve tried, at least for such a major style.\n",

      "Pours a slightly hazy, brilliant gold color with a large, thick, frothy, white head that recedes slowly to a small film that lingers a bit on the edges. Moderately high lacing and no legs. \n",
      "Flavor is somewhat sweet with moderately strong grain notes of bread, cracker, and biscuit. Moderately strong bitterness with medium light hop notes of woody, herbal and spicy notes with faint floral character and a hint of fruit esters. \n",
      "Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. \n",
      "Overall, a pretty enjoyable lager. Nice malt notes with assertive bitterness and hop notes. Hop notes and bitterness are not too strong though and malt is still center stage.\n",

      "This is a heavy hitter. %10 IPA VERY hoppy but the aroma is the most inviting thing. Taste isn exceptional and almost deceiving for such a high percentage. Notes of eccentric citrus and bitter but not to the point of undrinkable. You really have to take your time with it and allow your pallet to have a break in between sips to really appreciate what it has to offer.\n",
      "Wow this is damn good. Right away when I opened the can I could smell tropical fruits for days and the taste didn't disappoint neither. Packed with tropical fruits such as mango, papaya, passion fruit and in come the peaches and honey dew melon. This is world class IPA!\n",
      "One of the old guard of American craft brewers, Ommegang's artful delivery of Belgian styles is truly on par with many of the European MVPs that served as their influence. Hennepin is, dare I say, ever but as good, and perhaps better than Saison Du Pont, THE saison. Hennepin's deep golden body floats a thick even bubbled white head that leaves plenty of lacing behind with each swallow. Toasted malt, honey, orange, meadow flower, ginger and white peppercorn dance in a complex melange that shifts and changes with each sip. Mildly sweet as it fades, spicy hops dart in and out, piquing the palate with earthy, herbal goodness. The carbonation is fairly high, but not overdone or brittle. A modern classic.\n",
      "Pure peanut butter aroma, well chocolatey, cocoa, pitch black, sweet chocolate, 20% cocoa, very very nutty, thick, creamy, so smooth, incredibly drinkable, abv feels around 8%, just amazing brew. Tidy bit too sweet, but that's just personal preference.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. Rounding out the set of 4 Berry White meads we sampled. This, like the others, was fantastic. Sweet, honey, tart berry, fruity, hints of chocolate.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. This was my favorite of the 4 Berry White's we sampled. Sweet, earthy blueberry, hints of chocolate. Crazy good.\n",
      "Bottle at Levi's mead tasting. This was unbelievable. Strawberry, honey, sweet, and rich. So good!\n",
      "I'm not sure how you rate this beer less than 5. I understand tastes vary, but this is defines the style. Perfectly balanced. Delicious.\n",
      "I have been sampling many imperial stouts recently. Rasputin rises to the top. No extra flavorings, and all the better for it. Perfectly balanced and delicious. I know that tastes are personal, but the malt, hop and carbonation balance are perfect, and the alcohol level is high but doesn't totally overwhelm.\n",
      "Hazy purple pour with a small violet head. Aroma has vanilla and blueberry along with a sweet pastry. Taste is amazing, with blueberry, mild cherry, and a sweet cheese danish pastry. Absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet. Not overly tart. Perfection.\n",
      "fantastisk frugt dansk øl\n",
      "Great beer.  Drink in super bowl 54. A bit headache, not sure the reason. Hope being well tomorrow.\n",
      "Bottle 2019 vintage from modern times. Tastes of dark chocolate, cinnamon, rum, balsamic vinegar and vanilla. Not had this before and was quite amazed. The blending is on the mark.\n",
      "Attained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Dia de Los Mangos is a Belgian-style sour ale fermented and aged in oak barrels with mango, tamarind, and chili crafted by Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scent of chilis and mango are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 6.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancho chili greets you with a sweet spice on the take. Aleppo chili follows with a cayenne touch. Guajillo chili adds a smoky, berry like hue to the chili feel. Serrano chili provides a sharp earthy spice that deepens as the finish prolongs. Mango fairly sweetens the complexion, smooths the take, and slightly weighs the drink. Yellow chili assists with the sweet mango. A barnyard funk is notable with the juicy mango. Tamarind is vibrant in the earthy spice and lactic finish. Oak is sensible with the aleppo and guajillo chili characters. The chilis are tasted and felt when you licked your chops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dia de Los Mangos is a stunning Belgian-style sour ale. The bouquet of ancho, aleppo, yellow, guajillo, and serrano chilis along with tart tamarind and lactic yeast makes this beer a one of a kind. The mango makes this brew drinkable. The aleppo, guajillo, and serrano chilis ravishes the drink yet colorful. Tamarind, mangos, and ancho and yellow chilis provides a wonderful sweet tone. This is a spicy beer, yet it is pleasing for me but I have mention that I like my salsa hot and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this craft beer and enamored by the chili profile.\n",

Taste is sweet, sour and dry with citrusy and grapes. Finish is slightly tart, but still very nice ballance of everything. Light to medium body, dry texture, lively texture. Excellent birthday gift...\n",

      "Can from JRs. Pour is hazy pale fer sher. Rubbery nose. Same with taste, its kinda rubbery and floral at the same time. Yes, typical IPA, simply bitter bullshit. Rubbery finish too. What else can be said, its just another ubiquitous one of a million american IPA, there you have it.\n",
      "0,7 litre Bottle from Old Cellar Collection. Golden with white head. Malts, hops, sweetness. Oxidation.\n",
      "# 1122; 7/2018. Příšernej helles s výraznou žumpovou příchutí. Jinak sladovo-obilný, kořenitý. Velmi špatný pivo.\n",
      "Feb 2020. Bottle at Frankie and Bennie's. Tastes like an old school alcohol free lager. Reminds me of Kaliber. Ho hum. Drinkable. I like the bottle label.\n",
      "Bag-in-Box. Spandert. Delt med Rune. Ser ut som hvitvin. Aroma av grønne epler. Smaken diffus. Eplekjærner. Tørr avslutning.\n",

      "We get it, Ninkasi, you can make an IPA. Just because you can, though, doesn’t mean you should.\n",
      "Nice cider flavor, but the aftertaste threw me off. I would not drink again.\n",
      "Can, from can. Plum, sulfur, apricot, lingering unpleasant finish. Not much body and far from smooth. Exceptionally bad.\n",
      "12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Not sure why I bought a 12 pack of this ghetto beer. Was not expecting much and as is easy to believe, not getting much either! Nothing more to say other than sometimes a lightweight crap beer hits the spot.\n",
      "Clearish brown body and modest foam, heavy maraschino cherry on the nose. Flavour is thin maraschino cherry and maybe some malt but it's all really thin. Go big or go home if you're making a cherry bomb.\n",
      "Silver can with a black label. Pour is very murky hazy IPA. It smells like IPA too, heavy perfumy and piney olfactory. Taste is big bitter obnoxiousness. Nasty, rude ass, totally in yer face. Go figger. Just like any other million IPAs out there except maybe its really hazy. Could not appreciate. Nothing odd about this. It looks OS finally caved to commercialism. This style is so ubiquitous and they all mostly taste the same. I gotta quit buying this happy bullshit style. Its noteven good enough for a tik.\n",
      "Sigh, the usual. Earthy on the nose carrying over to the taste. Slightly metallic. Not very malty, not very hoppy, no lingering aftertaste. Watery and forgettable. Looks ok, nice bottle too.\n",

      "Stille Nacht Ottobre 2019. Ambrata carica, schiuma compattissima e pannosa. Aromi intensi di luppolo in fiore e zucchero candito. Al palato risulta strutturata in modo equilibratissimo : inizio caloroso e riscaldante dovuto all'alcol, che poi sfuma in dolci note speziate di caramello, luppolo, frutta matura, tutto fuso assieme e incredibilmente omogeneo. Finale morbido, rotondo, con un leggero retrogusto acidulo, mascherando la gradazione alcolica.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes.

      "Easy sweet pils. \n",
      "Pours a lovely golden straw colour with a lasting head. Rich malt smell, toffee touches. A sweet pils for sure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taste follows, easy pils, not too much to get excited about but it's a quality brew. Would have this again no problem on a hot day.\n",
      "355ml bottle. Amber colour with white head. Big sweet apricot, malty, sweet wheaty, sweet apricot jam, floral, light honey, light citrus, light tartness, light white sugar, light bitterness. Not super complex but v refreshing + drinkable, lots of sweet apricot but not in an artificial way, nice\n",
      "Can. Dark golden, slightly cloudy. Hop aroma with some malt.  Really good. Strong, with good but not the very strong hop flavor many DIPAs have.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear golden orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Medium herbal coffee, spicy notes, medium dough malt, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Pours thick black with thin dark tan head. Aroma is cocoa, maple syrup, roast and cinnamon. Taste is chocolate, maple syrup and brown sugar, moving to cinnamon and roast. Finish is chocolate, maple syrup and cinnamon.\n",
      "Draught. Pours clear yellow with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Medium rich biscuit malt, medium citrus hops and hop bitterness, a clean lager character, and a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.\n",
      "Banana, light hoppyness, refreshing and sweet. This beer is completely drinkable and doesn't deserve this hate. A zero? No Lol...\n",
      "Can from Cap Tap. Pours clear gold with a thick white head and a citrus aroma. There is a near full-bodied pale malt flavor with with a very bitter finish.\n",
      "6 pack of 12 ounce bottles from a Kroger in Roanoke. Date stamp is 01-09-2020, I assume this is a bottling date and not a bb date. Pours a slightly hazy, copper-chestnut color with an enduring film of cream. Nose of toffee, earthy peat, toasted nut, orange and a whiff of sourish apple. Flavors of the same stuff with more from the apple than indicated in the aroma. Medium bodied with a pleasant, low-medium carbonation and a nice balance. Mild astringency from the peat plus pithy hop notes help to dry the big malts quite well at the finish.\n",
      "Black appearance with a bubbly tan head. Aroma of toasted oak, roasted malt, bitter chocolate and light earthy notes. Similar flavor, oaky and roasty with mild sweetness and mild bitterness. Medium to full body with a soft feel and a lingering woody finish.\n",
      "440ml can from We Brought Beer, Balham.  Black with a tan head.  Aroma of vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, treacle and dark sugar.  They really nailed this flavour-wise.  Neither too strong on the vanilla, the lactose nor the coffee.  Just a really nice beer, with lovely nuance of flavour.\n",
      "Bottle from barrell and still shop, Plymouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Loved this, very clean amber colour appearance, no haze but a decent look to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of nice citrus notes alongside orange tints in the aroma. Juicy! Taste also has these tiny pine needles. A very sessionable pale indeed. Enjoyed it.\n",
      "[Cask at the Old Manor (JDW), Bracknell.] A pale amber pour with a tight white head; grassy aroma; and a caramel malt body; then a biscuity finish with a twiggy bitterness. A simple bitter.\n",
      "Had to get this one, if only to send a pic to my best buddy of the same name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours dark with a finger of brown head that fades to a thick ring, light lacing. Aromas are heavily roasted malt and sweet vanilla. Excellent tasting stout with mellow notes of cocoa, vanilla, and lactose sweet - none of which are overdone. Super smooth light-medium mouthfeel, and semi-bitter roasty finish. Well done!\n",
      "Black appearance with a tan head. Enticing aroma of gourmet coffee, maple syrup, mild caramel and light smoky malts. Similar flavor, rich, layered and moderately sweet with a light earthy bitterness. Medium body with a pleasant finish. Nice!\n",

      "Golden, hazy, white beerhead with frothy, thick and lacing foam. Good retention. The aroma is hoppy, such as floral, fruity (kiwi, mango, banana) spices and somehow herbal. Medium sweetness, medium carbonation, medium bitterness, and smooth touch. Alcoholic warmth.\n",
      "Copper colour, creamy foam atop. Brown sugar/caramel, creamy, malts, bready, fruit/melon undertones... it really has all you need in a 'standard' bitter. Excellent example of the style.\n",
      "Bottle from M&S.  BB Aug 2021; Drank Jan 2020 - Very dark brown / black.  Small tan head.  Very malty, roasty malts, dark chocolate, coffee, liquorice.  Moderate hop bitterness.  Dried fruits, raisins.  Spicy.  Sweet-bitter dry roast chocolate and coffee malty hoppy fruity and spicy.  Dry burnt roast finish.  Enjoyed this.  Good one.  (2020-01)\n",
      "Creamy white good mostly lasting head. Yellow colour. Moderate malty and heavy hoppy aroma. Heavy bitter flavor. Long heavy bitter finish. Creamy palate.\n",
      "Bottled, 330ml from Pump it Up, Belper, Derbys. Deep dark chestnut with cream head. This is rich and smooth from the off, darkly roasted malts with a note of caramelisation, some sweet toffee'd notes, liquorice. Fruity tones come through, red port wine, grapes and fig flavours. Easy on the palate, notes of dry plum in the close. Loved it.\n",
      "Прекрасная немецкая пшеничка. Нефильтрованное, непастеризованное. Приятный богатый вкус. Рекомендую. Одно из моих фаворитов.\n",
      "Getting really tired of this sweet beers the dessert Brews. Nevertheless this is fairly decent and does taste like its name\n",
      "Конечно, я пробовал баночное, но такого восторга, как пишут об этом немецком пиве, не ощутил. Достаточно обычное пиво. Ничего выдающегося. На один раз. Ну может на два.\n",
      "Хорошая немецкая пшеничка. Нефильтрованное, непастеризованное. Хороший баланс. Единственный минус - достаточно высокая цена. Около 3 долларов за бутылку.\n",
      "Попробовал 12 сортов немецкого пива, бутылки и банки, но это -  однозначно фаворит. Воистину пиво, в  котором всё в меру - и сладость, и кислинка, и горечь. Ничего не убрать, ничего не добавить. Рекомендую всем!\n",

      "Color naranja oscuro, turbia, translúcida. Espuma blanca de más de un dedo de espesor y media retención. Aroma a melocotón maduro y ligera resina que se intensifica rápidamente con la temperatura. Sabor a resina, melocotón y miel, final largo, resinoso, excesivo al llegar a mitad de toma, ligeramente seco, alcohol notable, cansino al atemperar y unirse a la resina. Textura semioleosa. Carbonatación media.\n",

      "This was great.  Black with mocha head.  Smooth and thick.  Vanilla comes through the most, with light roast (could have bet there was coffee in here too), cocoa, deep malts.  Very nice!\n",
      "Black as my soul with mocha head.  Thick but NO sign of 15.5%, in part because the roasted malts hazelnut and awesome JBM coffee (my personal favorite) obscure the alcohol.  Great great great dessert beer.  4.5-\n",
      "Color negro, opaca. Un dedo de espuma marrón con buena retención. Aroma a malta tostada, café chocolate negro, canela y notas de guindilla. Gusto en la misma línea del aroma, añadiría vainilla y avena, bastante láctea y el chili habanero lo tiene bastante pronunciado. Cuerpo oleoso. Una maravilla de Imperial Stout, la edición anterior tenía la canela mucho más marcada y en esta el habanero manda, obligado su elaboración anual.\n",
      "13.2%ABV.   Imperial stout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tapped out black.  40°SRM. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nose has aromas of earth, wood, fire.  There are elements of raw flour, wheat dust, dry hay as well which for me is totally attractive for a stout, which is so rare these days. It’s probably the PB2 that’s giving it the depth of earthy aroma. This is the aroma that suggest wet rotting logs, a compost heap, and fresh turned earth.  The nose has a bit of umami funk that suggest raw soy sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mouthfeel is full and juicy with watered honey.  Low-moderate carbonation.  There is a bit of a carbonic tingle on the palate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Palate has flavors peanut butter and jelly.  There are herbal flavors suggesting licorice and lineament. There is nice base flavor peanut like a nice peanut butter sandwich or a Thai satay peanut sauce.  There are ample roasty flavors that suggest black coffee, espresso, charcoal and burnt ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hop flavors are woody with a hint of pine resin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finish is surprisingly brief and clean with a hint of umami that suggests dashi, bonito flakes or soy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a big complex imperial stout that’s not like any other peanut butter concoction. This iteration seems to have gone umami, funky, and earthy instead of creamy, sweet, and boring.\n",
      "750 ml bottle from the brewery. Weird to change the blend so dramatically in year 6 of this beer. Pours a deep, dark, inky and basically opaque brown with virtually no head. The liquid leaves thick legs in the glass as it goes down, too. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, dark dried fruits, and molasses. Medium-full bodied, with low to modest carbonation and a sweet, slick, rich, warming, coating mouthfeel in great balance. It's great. Not quite to the level of TWCP Maman but slightly better than previous vintages.\n",
      "Holy hell, what a beer...Cocoa, coffee, vanilla, black cherry, molasses, and anise, backed up by oak, chiles, roast, spice, and a lovely rum warmth. Amazing in its balance, never growing overly sweet or boozy, with a gentle, easygoing texture that would be surprising at 8%, much less friggin’ 15%. Amazing. The best Bomb! of them all. I want more. So much more.\n",
      "Sample at the taproom during Jackie O's XIV Anniversary on 1/11/20. Dark red pour with a medium pink head. Nose of malt, cherry and vanilla. Cherry pie, basically. Malt and cherry flavor leading into vanilla before a sour cherry finish. Really good stuff.\n",
      "Couleur jaune paille bien voilée; au nez, le fruit jaune, mangue, ananas.\n",
      "En bouche, les fruits tropicaux, mange, ananas, c'est légèrement laiteux, avec un picotement dans la gorge qui fait du bien. Une finale piquante sur le fruit qui perdure! Miam délicieux, c'est presque parfait!\n",
      "De Landbierparadies. En vaso de hefe de Bavaria. Viendo Sex Education 2x02-03. Sobresaliente feel, dan ganas de bebersela de un trago. Perfil maltoso muy fresco, con notas herbales y excelente equilibrio dulzor/amargor\n",
      "This stuff is phenomenal. Just working on the last one from my four pack and I'll be going back to get some more. Big sour pineapple and coconut with the milk sugar finishing it out.\n",
      "Dark brown, near black. Strong aroma of roasted coffee beans.  In taste, dominant roast coffee flavour, chocolate, some vanilla,  malt, bitter note, sweetness. Medium carbonation, medium body. Best coffee porter I’ve had.  Surprised to see it’s 9% ABV - can’t taste the alcohol. Smart black and beige can design.\n",
      "Fles 35,5cl thuis. 2019 batch. 11,3%. Zwaar, vol en vet, bourbon, zoet, chocolade, koffietonen, roasted malts, ahornsiroop, boozy, caramel. (26-1-2020).\n",
      "Aroma: Lovely malty smell with sweet notes\n",
      "Appearance: Very dark beer with somewhat of an amber glow, soft foamy head\n",
      "Taste: Nice round balanced flavour with a nice level of hops and sweetness along with some sour fruity tastes\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Very smooth, heavy and creamy\n",
      "Overall: I really can't fault this beer on anything, it's as delicious and iconic as ever from one of the top independent brewers in England. This is real ale within a budget done right. 5/5, no question.\n",
      "Can.  Pours as expected, black velvet with a thin but holding tan head. \n",
      " Rich aromas, and equally alluring warming flavors ... cocoa mostly, dark chocolate, the thinnest of coffee profiles.  Absolutely delicious! \n",

      "Clean nice beer crisp light and drinkable and good beer. Greta bbf 202020 birmingham\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. dispensed to only a snifter showing an ultra cloudy, pulpy orange color, with a presentable layer of soft white froth, and a sheeting band of lacing. The nose was rather expressive, with mild dankness, citrus, tropical fruit as pineapple & mango, creaminess, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Medium bodied, the taste was similar, the sweetness & cream seemed to disappear, as the carbonation was rather low, thus prompting the notion of thinning texture. Bitterness was fruity, rind-like, pulpy, and earthy, with some dryness to the finish. All the right notes in the wrong proportions. Also, not necessarily snifter worthy for the price point.\n",
      "Canette de 355 ml. Arômes de fruits exotiques et de houblon. Goût de pamplemousse, d'ananas et de houblon. Bonne IPA standard.\n",
      "Keg @ Jack In the Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy-frothy head.  Has a light Helles styling, but is evident enough with perhaps its crispness its best feature.\n",
      "Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Darker brew with a small head. It's not overly fruity but the actual blackberry is evident within its taste.\n",
      "Bottle. Clear copper liquid with medium off-white head. Aroma of floral hops, earth, bready malt, citrus and light caramel. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter with notes of malt, wort, raw sugar and table sugar. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice aroma but overly sweet, worty taste. Same problem as many other NAs.\n",
      "Can at home. Pours black with a dirty tan head. Aroma is banana, chocolate, boozy fruit cake, molasses. Taste is a big boozy fruit cake, treacle, banana. Finishes with boozy zing. Drinks below 11%. Lovely and smooth. Great stuff\n",

      "Clear yellow tint from a bottle. Big white head. Nose is clean beer with some lemon, barely. First taste is bubbly fun, refreshing. Not sure if I can pick out the orange but fer sher the lemon is there. Second gulp is easy going, not as much of the lemonade thing going on here like many shandies, its just good beer with a tad of citrus.   I can appreciate this more than your typical shandy, lacks the sugar factor. Makes it more like a real beer instead of lemonade. Good job peter, an example that any maker of a shandy should follow. Nothing artificial in this brew. Good co2 clear to the end. Could drink a few of these with no problem.\n",
      "Amber-brown with a settling foam, slightly artificial mango, caramel and leafy hops on the nose. The fruit is more restrained on the palate, complementing rather than swamping a dry, pithy-piney and earthy bitterness that speaks of England as much as, if not more than, the new world.\n",

      "Can  from Lost Dog Café in North Arlington, VA\n",
      "Aroma: tropical fruit, citrus, floral, earthy\n",
      "Appearance: hazy golden with a white head\n",
      "Taste: medium sweetness, medium bitterness\n",
      "Mouthfeel: average carbonation, creamy feel, medium body, long finish\n",
      "Delicious\n",
      "Grass and pine in a glass.  The smell resembles cat pee.  La Cumbre knocked it out of the park with this one.\n",
      "Taps opaque honey with a thin beige head. Aroma delivers serious peach plus raw malt, piney hops, a citrus touch. Flavor yields sweet, zesty peach that could have come straight from the tree, piney hops, tangy malt, tropical and citrus hints. Texture features firm, ciscous body and lively fizz with a fruity finish. A peach of a brewski!\n",
      "440ml can. Jet black colour with late awakening, average, thick, creamy, moderately lasting and lacing, tan head. Sweet-ish, chocolately, dark malty and spicy aroma, notes of chocolate, gingerbread, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice. Taste is sweet, chocolately dark malty and spicy, slightly citrusy fruity, notes of dark chocolate, gingerbread, orange zest, hints of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice, some black pepper, coriander, cardamom, a touch of aniseed. Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, soft carbonation, lingering, minimally cloying, chocolately finish. Well balanced, perfectly X-Mas adequate composition, dangerously drinkable, almost a bit refreshing due to the orange zest partition. Excellent!\n",
      "0,33 bottle. A sör csodásan néz ki. Az üveg és cimke tekintélyt parancsoló, a hab hatalmas, nagy lyukú barna, a sör színe pedig csodás sötét gesztenye-barna. Illata mazsolás, konyakos, fűszeres, kiemelkedő! Sokáig lehetne még az illat összetevőkről írni. de tényleg. Szénsavasság eltalálva, pont jó. Picit cukros-édes, de mellette kesernyés, fanyar, mégis aszalt gyümölcsös is, egyszóval komplex. Egy ugyanilyen hírű trappista dubbel után teszteltem azonnal, és ez klasszisokkal jobb! Testes, komoly, mégis jól iható kiemelkedő sör!\n",
      "Tasting at Andrey'sPitch black colour. Intense dark chocolate, with a layer of vanilla, hazelnuts, coconut; it's full bodied, very sweet, with the richest chocolate flavour, nuts, vanilla, bourbon, and a nice warmth in the finish.Wonderful.\n",
      "What a beer. Oh my God this beer is insane.. I was expecting something less from the famous and classic \"KBS\" but this for me is simple a better beer all around.\n",
      "First of all the aroma is great like usual.. You smell coffe and chocolate notes very much.. But the mouthfeel is the best i have get from any beer out there in my life. The beer embrace your mouth with such a pleasand and smooth aura and make the whole thing so good.. The taste is sweet with more chocolate notes this time because \"KBS\" has more coffe than chocolate. Here the taste is what i want from any beer out there. Also slightly alcohol taste in the finish..\n",
      "Overall one insane beer to drink and for sure one of the best in this world.. All here is Godlike!\n",
      "Bottle thanks to Ryan and Ibrew2or3, shared at Tilt during SHNup: Poured dark brown black with off white head. Aroma is super peach sticky fruit. Taste is super peach very boozy burnt malts. World class barleywine!\n",
      "Whole Foods Market. Abrams. Bottle. Dark ebony color, light thin head. Wonderful blend of bourbon-barrel aged stout. Creme brûlée , burnt sugar, vanilla hints. One of the best of the style...\n",
      "Pours obsidian with a dark khaki head. Smells of leather and dried fruit. Tastes of plumb and cocoa nibs. Some honey sweetness and not overwhelming bourbon booziness. Great luxurious imperial stout.\n",
      "This is another great sour for a beginner. It isn’t so sour it will blow your mind and your tongue, but it has great flavor as well as sourness. Interested in trying the other flavors.\n",
      "I’m not usually a sour beer fan, but this swayed me over to the other side. It’s sour, but not too strong with hints of sweet that have your brain trying to figure out if it’s sweet or sour. It has a lot of flavor, which most sours miss and no, it is not spicy.\n",
      "very hoppy aroma. the hops and bitterness continue throughout. a really solid west coast DIPA. impressed with this brewery.\n",
      "Cask at CBC, Covent Garden on 23rd June 2019. Clear amber with loose white foam. Richly hoppy aroma with spice and peel. Rich and intense citrus and tropical fruits in mouth with peach, apricot, grapefruit and lemon zest. A lasting, solid hoppy finish. Full bodied with a thick texture. Absolutely exquisite.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is a double dry hopped pale ale brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pineapple is juicy and felt upon the mouthfeel in the dry finish. Grapefruit blends with the pineapple and fairly bitters the take. Oranges are discerned as the finish prolongs. Mango fills the body and smoothens the drink. Cantaloupe is noticeable with the watery aspect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is an appetizing American pale ale. The pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and cantaloupe come together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple and grapefruit dazzles the take. The light orange note compliments the cantaloupe. The double dry hop is barely noticeable until the dry finish. I enjoyed drinking this brew and found the pineapple dry finish to persist long after you drink it.\n",

      "# 923; 1/2018. Lehký, kořenitý a sladový březňák. Vcelku pivo nezajímavé a s nedobrou dochutí.\n",
      "# 921; 1/2018. V podstatě takový pivo bez chuti a zápachu. Míň sladší kofola.\n",
      "# 913; 12/2017. Velice špatné, nepitelné nealko. Příšerně vyčpělé, silně glukózové, s velmi nepříjemnu hořkostí.\n",
      "Bottle at a tasting. Hazy amber. Yeast, chocolate, quite artificial. \n",
      "Sweet, candy, chocolate, caramel, very artificial and messy.  Medium-bodied, sticky.\n",
      "# 900 et # 924; 11/2017 et 1/2018 (can and bottle). Prázdný pivo s karamelovou příchutí a nepříjemnou, drsnou, krátkou hořkostí - podobá se špatné a levné whisky. Lahvové o něco horší.\n",
      "Can taste the alcohol, not great flavor profile. The hops are drowned out by the higher ABV content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Summit's EPA is great but this doesn't compare.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Kroger Beckley, WV, 1/16/20. Hazy orange, thin creamy white head. Aroma of tart apple and apple cider vinegar. I think this is off. Taste is basically straight vinegar. Definitely bad. Sad.\n",
      "Found out of can. Pours a clear straw yellow. It's pretty much a PBR or something of that caliber. Fine for a quantity beer.\n",
      "Hat mit Hanf wenig zu tun (0,2%). Zwar könnte selbst eine solch geringe Konzentration deutlich prägnanter sein, der künstlich Zucker süße Teegeschmack mit pappig muffigen Bier überlagert aber alles.\n",
      "Tap (Euston Tap, London) (4:1:3:1:6=1.5)\n",
      "Ugly grapefruit juice look, a bit grey, and no head. Dirty aroma, yeasty, a touch fruity. Slimy palate, and dead in the mouth, I want to scrape my tongue. Horrid dirty yeasty taste. This is just trub, this is the shit you should have thrown away.\n",
      "490ml can from Mini C in Chiang Mai. Pours clear yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of malt. Some grain taste. Sweet oily finish.\n",
      "# 879; 9/2017. Velmi citrusový, mladinový, bylinný a téměř nepitelný. Ještě horší ve srovnání s Argus Nealko. Vylito.\n",
      "Hazy orange, peach and bronze glow with a thinnish, two centimetre tall tan head, relatively large-bubbled. Aroma of crisp citrus, very light floral notes, a small dash of alcohol and a faint hint of malts - very light in the nose. Light-bodied; Strong dry and herbal flavours at first with a tiny dose of citrus-based hops with no bitterness or alpha acids at all. Very mild and dry with almost no real flavours picked up in entirety, with a bit of sweetness on the tail end, but even that is mild. Aftertaste is subdued, just as the rest of this is - a faint dose of flavours and hay with little else, no malt or alcohol picked up - so faint, which dose actually make this a bad thing. Overall, a very boring and incredibly underwhelming beer - even for the style of a Light IPA! This tates like a low (or no) alcohol beer, and even then, not a good one! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased Shopper's Food Warehouse (on the last trip ever) in Alexandria, Virginia on 12-December-2019 for US$1,55 sampled at my house in Washington on 16-December-2019.\n",
      "# 861; 9/2017. Nedobrý, nakyslý, jednoduše a ploše karamelový a lehce kořenitý polotmavý ležák.\n",
      "Not much of a Bohemian pils. Just some mash malt. Pours golden with ok head. Tangy cloying finish. Tap at Doghaus.\n",

      "Handpull cask at the Beer Pharmacie, Syston. Light copper, translucent, with a good-sized off-white head on top. Aroma is malt-dominated, with an earthy breadiness. The initial sweet, malty taste turns to a leafy hop bitter almost immediately, with notes of redcurrants in the aftertaste. Soft carbonation. A basic but enjoyable basic bitter.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy yellow with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention. Medium acidity and tartness, lime, tamarind, and chili peppers, light cracker malt, and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.\n",
      "Bottle from Cloudwater. Abv 7%. Purple to red colour with no real head. Aroma blueberry taste tangy sour. Light body.\n",
      "On tap at Big Dog's, I assume the pom in the name refers to pomegranate as this had a nice light fruit flavor. Definitely didn't see the 9%.  I liked this quite a bit, but I have a bias towards pomegranate beer.\n",
      "Keg at the brewery taproom - Bermondsey. Pours black-brown with a frothy, beige head. Rich and ashy roast defines the character, with mellow sweetness supporting, some coffee grounds, scorched earth, toasted pine and orange peel. Medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Great balance in the finish. Excellent beer.\n",
      "Bottle at home in Hackney - picked up at the brewery. Pours black-brown with a foamy, beige head. Luxurious and delicious, with lots of layered chocolate character, a bit of chocolate sauce, ripening dark fruits, subtle roast, creamy-sugary coffee. Full bodied, oily and lightly chewy, with fine carbonation. Softly warming finish, almost a little sticky, more more decadent chocolate character, raisins, mellow earthy bitterness, more dense fresh coffee. Has an obscene amount of depth. Makes for a great sipper. Delicious.\n",
      "On tap at Big Dog's, this was super sweet. The sugar was just off the charts. A bit creamy but just too sweet to enjoy.  A rare miss for Able Baker, imo.\n",
      "Keg at the Beer Pharmacie, Syston. Dark brown with a ring of khaki/tan head. Milk chocokate, a tpuch of cola nut in the aroma, with less of the advertised salted caramel than I expected although it's still a component. Tastes sweet with toffee notes to the fore, followed by a light hop bitterness in the finish. Liquorice in the aftertaste along with more chocolate and caramel. Light carbonation. While not the most focused beer, it certainly has a pleasant composition.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A very dark brown beer with a beige head. Aroma of bourbon, rum Barrel, dark roasted malt. Taste of dark roasted malt, coffee, burned malt rum barrel.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A slightly hazy yellow golden beer with a white head. Aroma of sweet banana, quite yeasty. Taste of sweet banana, yeast, some phenols, quite sweet.\n",
      "Sampled @ Braukunst Live 2020. A slightly hazy dark amber beer with a off white head. Aroma of strong caramelized malt, red malt, caramel, honey. Taste of strong caramelized malt, honey, riped fruits, boozy.\n",
      "Puszka. Czarny kolor. Piana beżowa,średnia opada dość szybko. W zapachu raczej nikłe nuty whiskey, można złapać ulotne akcenty beczki i palonej kawy,palony słód. Delikatna tekstura i raczej małe wysycenie przypominają bardziej stouta niż portera. W smaku kawa,delikatna whiskey ,beczkowe nuty,lekki tytoń li skóra. Bardzo fajne...zobaczymy co się stanie po ogrzaniu..chyba tylko więcej goryczki,brykietu i tytoniu..\n",

      "Ty Koelschtrinker. Välimus on läbipaistmatu helekollane. Lõhn ja maitse on magus, viljane, tummine, linnaseline, natuke võine. Hea.\n",

      "Pours a very hazy amber/orange colour with a large foamy off-white head. Aromas of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, banana, pine, zesty, floral, wheat and grass. Taste is more of the same notes, tropical, citrus, orange, grapefruit, floral, hints of tea with a zesty earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Fair carbonation. Medium bodied with a very slightly oily mouthfeel and a long fruity hop aftertaste. Excellent\n",

      "On tap at Valhalla Craft Beer Bar, Zagreb. Clear golden to dark golden, small off-white head. Aroma is malty and fruity, cherry with a touch of caramel.

Wonderfully executed.\n",

      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL., and nitro dispensed as a 5 oz. serving showing a cascading effect to the darkest brown color, with some ruby highlighting, a silky layer of tan froth, and spiraling cling to the sheeting lacing. The nose was initially mild, but gradually presented cocoa, slight treacle, cream, sweetness, vanilla, and subtle spices as cinnamon & ginger. Medium bodied, the taste was as the aroma, with the nitro influence fading to nil, but still quite flavorful without the carbonation.\n",

      "Appearance: Pitch black with a small slow disappearing brown head\n",
      "Taste: Moderate sweet and bitter, strong coffee, bourbon and maple ending in a light alcoholic warm finish\n",
      "Mouthfeel: Oily texture with soft carbonation\n",
      "Overall: Nice complex and easy drinking imperial stout :)\n",
      "From a bottle shared at Baba day. A fairly light yellow pour with yeast saison very much in taste and good\n",
      "AROMA: Notas medias esterosas que recuerdan la ciruela. Malta media aroma a caramelo. Notas medias de alcohol dulce. Sin aroma a lúpulo y son fenoles ausentes. APARIENCIA: Cerveza marrón oscuro con tonos rojizos sin turbidez y con una espuma color canela y cremosa de mediana retención. SABOR: Sabor maltoso con notas a caramelo. Ésteres medios con notas de ciruelas pasas. Lúpulo bajo o ausente. Balance maltoso con un final seco en el que en el retrogusto permanece un equilibrado sabor esteroso con notas a frutas negras y unas ciertas notas dulces de alcohol. SENSACIONES EN BOCA: Cuerpo medio, carbonatación media, con un ligero calentamiento producido por el alcohol. Suave, sin astringencias ni asperezas ni cremosidad. IMPRESIÓN GENERAL: Una cerveza muy agradable de trigo con una bebebilidad alta. Sabrosa, compleja, con un equilibrio muy alto entre el alcohol elevado y los ésteres frutales.\n",

      "Color marrón rojizo, ligera turbidez. Dos dedos de espuma con excelente retención. Aroma complejo, malta tostada, miel, moscatel, ligera uva y flores, caramelo y cognac. Gusto a malta tostada, caramelo, vino blanco, cognac, madera, fruta confitada, pomelo, mermelada de naranja amarga y un punto especiado. Cuerpo medio. Un cerveza de lo más complejo que he probado en mi bida, que pasada, voy a intentar cada año hacerme con una edición Vintage porque son lo más, brutalísima.\n",
      "12oz bottle.  Pours dark brown with a moderate brown head.  Aroma is coffee, roast, licorice, and some alcohol.  Taste is chocolate fudge, licorice, brown sugar, caramel, roast, and coffee.  Bitter finish.  Full body.  Soft carbonation.  Viscous, creamy mouthfeel.\n",
      "Pours an opaque brownish black from the wax dipped bottle with tiny bubbles of fluffy tan foam that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of huge chocolate with coconut and vanilla barrel notes, a sweet molasses and slight booze. Taste is more booze and slight oxidation, a light cinnamon underneath with fruity yeast and caramel. Wow, awesome.\n",
      "12oz bottle.  Pours nearly black with a small khaki head.  Aroma is licorice, coffee, roast, and some chocolate.  Taste is roast, dark baker's chocolate, coffee, licorice, and some raisin.  Dry.  Moderately bitter.  Medium body.  Medium carbonation.  Lightly creamy, coffee-like mouthfeel.\n",
      "Smells like straight bourbon. Pitch black pour. Taste is dark fruit, chocolate, bourbon, cinnamon, spice, melted caramel. Smell is tough but very great taste\n",

      "Absence of Light has a medium, beige head, a dark brown appearance, and very minimal glass lacing. The aroma is of peanut butter and dark malts. The flavor is similar, with cocoa, cream, coffee, and no bitterness. Mouthfeel is into heavy, and Absence of Light finishes medium dry. RJT\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick and persistent cocoa head. Aroma yields roast malt, quality coffee, chocolate, earthy and nutty tones, demanding a taste. Flavor provides rich coffee, chocolate, roast malt, nutty, earthy and subtle toffee notes, adding up to one delicious ale. Texture features firm, viscous body and lively fizz. You'll need a steady hand to drink this one!\n",
      "Noir et d'une mousse brunâtre, au nez, le chocolat, la vanille et le coconut sont dominant! En bouche, c'est solidement un dessert de forêt noir. C'est lourd et sucré, une texture huileuse en bouche. Le chocolat dans le fond, avec un bon coté vanillé avec des traces de noisettes grillés! Excellent dessert quoi que un peu loiurd, mais tellement un bon régale!\n",
      "Well it was a warm January day yesterday so I feel like there is a cold snap coming.  This one and Sam summer are some of my favorite Samuel Adams beers.\n",
      "Had this last night (one of a six I purchased directly from the brewery), 2 Row's Feelin’ Hazy NE DIPA.  Unfiltered, to the point of noticeable chunks of yeast in the pour, which dissolve as the beer warms from the 38 degrees of my fridge.  Effervescent in the mouth, big hops (pine nuts, resin) on the start, but with a rounded, juicy, citrus finish.  Great balance of bitter at the start and very slightly sweet at the end. Hides its 9% very well because of its inherent drinkability.  It’s an excellent version of the NE style from a promising new Utah brewery. It may be in the Straptank Hazy league (a limited ed. from the talented Springville brewmaster), but since that beer has evolved into a legend in my mind, it’s hard for me to say. Regardless, the 2 Row NE is very, very good.\n",
      "Saint Archer Gold has a thick, white head, a clear, bubbly, straw appearance, and no glass lacing. The aroma is of sweet, musty grains, and the flavor is similar, with a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Saint Archer Gold finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT\n",
      "Medium to sweet, not sweet in my opinion.  For me this really hits the spot and has a light refreshing flavour with good, lingering appley after-taste.    (As a cava drinker, this also has perfect level of carbonation for me.)\n",
      "Una cerveza excepcional dentro de la tipología alemana Helles. Con 5,1% de alcohol resulta suave en la boca, con poco sabor a lúpulo y muy refrescante. \n",
      "A un precio muy razonable por su calidad, y pertenece a la cervecería más antigua de Alemania.\n",
      "Bottle from supermarket in Copenhagen\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice, deep-golden color. Hazy. Substantial, off-white head lasting several sips.\n",
      "Nose is like a flower bouquet with a strong, slightly soapy, royal hops scent (something I've really come to enjoy).\n",

      "Taste has notes of herbs, a not-too-synthetic flower petal sweetness and a very balanced hops bitterness that effectively hides any trace of ethanol. \n",

      "Medium body, soft and pleasant mouthfeel, medium fizzyness. A layered beer... One of the better ones. Have it with pizza. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every once in a while I find a beer that has me speaking in foreign dialects, because it is so good. Pouring a slightly cloudy light gold color in the glass with a rather large white head on top. Mild aroma has some hint of hops with malts. Taste is a well balanced  mild hop presence with toasted malt and a hint of butterscotch cookie dough. Old school IPA for sure.\n",

      "Clear rich golden with a thick foamy white head.  Rich lovely classic west coast nose full of floral fresh hoppy resins with a light touch of grapefruit. Crisp semi dry flavor that’s grapefruity with a light citrusy peel sweetness and a little floral hop resin. Delicious and balanced but features a flavorful classic west coast hop tone.\n",
      "Now I can feel the ibu 60 beer a litter bitter. But the aroma exceed the bitterness.\n",
      "As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.\n",

      "Tap at mad mex in robinson.  Clear pale with decent co2 on the palate. Taste is somewhat bitter. It also is a little medicinal in the middle. Difficult near the end. Heavy hop citrus bite. Weird, dull & aged slaggy hop ending.\n",
      "On tap at mad mex in robinson. Big & black with no head. Certainly smells like gingerbread. First taste is thicj, viscous, rich and almost cloying. No co2, must be on nitro; but I tell you, this needs some co2 to set it off. Sticky sweet and difficult in the middle. You really got to sip this stuff or it may make you gag. So difficult, or did I say that already. Alky is hidden, but it comes across like a chocolate liquor. Getting dizzy on the finish, whew.\n",
      "Clear golden with a one finger wide head.\n",
      "Malty smell with a hay note. Unbalanced taste for such a beer. It has this malty component typical for beers without alcohol, which can be a bit disturbing. And the end of the sip has a disagreeable bitterness, way too bitter for a Kölsch. Strong carbonation.\n",
      "Clear 275ml bottle found at a supermarket on Nevis. Pours bright girly clear pink with strong carbonation and foam gone fast. Flavour is sugary fake strawberry, I think I smell apple in there but I'm not sure. Flavour is fake strawberry with some apple and there's this cloying chemical aftertaste. Slightly worse than the original, but drinkable if near freezing and you're boozing it up at the beach bar and are so drunk you just don't care.\n",
      "Cask at GBBF 2006, Earl’s Court on 05/08/2006.  Not sure if this was served right and my notes were ‘toffee and butterscotch’.  Seem others thought the same at different times, so maybe was just a bad beer.\n",
      "Can from YIG in North Bay. \n",
      "Clear yellow pour, with a small white head. Aroma is straight up stale crackers, nothing more, nothing less, just stale and musty. No hops, cereals are bland, mouth feel is good though, carb is standard. Finish is lightly bitter, more crackers, and hints of grass. I cant tell if this is just old, or infected, or what, but i wont be returning.\n",
      "Bottle from total wine, St petersburg. Your regular Caribbean lager, perfect in a warm day, but nothing to write home about.\n",
      "Pours straw-yellow with a thin head. Acerbic aroma. Taste has very little of note, a little grassy malt. Palate has almost nothing of note. Bad.\n",
      "Clear bottle found in St. Kitts. Pours a green tinted yellow with barely any foam, and it's gone quick anyway. Smells of apple juice and very soft homebrew white wine. Flavour is weak apple juice with some vague alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is sugary.

      "\"Jadewölfe Herbstmond\", Fläschchen (MHD: 17.5.2020) von Hopfen & Malz (noch) im Wedding. - Goldbraun, gut trüb. - In der Nase herbfruchtige Jujube (chinesische Dattel), obergärige Fruchtigkeit von leicht künstlicher Süße (Kaugummi), Honig, weißer Pfeffer, vor allem aber eine intensive, leicht stechende Essigsäure, die bei Erwärmung immer penetranter wird. - Antrunk satt karamelmalzig und für einen Moment noch fruchtig süß, bevor der grelle essigartige Säurestich einsetzt, gegen den auch die aromatische krautige Hopfenherbe nicht mehr ankommt. Die Dattel schmeckt nurmehr leicht heraus. Durchschnittlich rezent, vollmundig; Alkohol ist nicht ganz kaschiert. Im Abgang ranzig essigsauer mit Resten krautiger Hopfenherbe. - Leider durch den penetranten Säurestich völlig verdorben. Hier hat wohl mal wieder ein Craft-Brauer die Hygiene auf die leichte Schulter genommen ... (7.1.2020.)\n",

      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 14/05/2006.  A very bland beer.  Czech hops aren’t necessarily the most in your face, but surely they could have brewed some kind of beer to showcase them?  This was all malt and not very pleasant.\n",

      "December 14th, 2015 - The smell of Christmas hangs heavy over this hazy, cinnamon colored beer. Vanilla and custard tease rich desserts, while cinnamon and clove give the scent it's holiday cheer. The flavor is weaker than the aroma, with an odd tanginess, but I do find comfort in the brusque, rye focused aftertaste.\n",

      "Sampled on draught at the Round Man brewpub in Spooner, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy golden straw colored brewer with a thick white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of golden grain malt, some layering years, and floral hops. Taste is medium to medium-full bodied, creamy golden grain malt with some floral and light grassy hop flavors. Finish is smooth as silk with a short bitterness followed by a crisp finish. Reminds me of the lager from Das Bierhaus that I was greatly fond of.\n",
      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick chocolate-milkshake head. Aroma yields rich bourbon, smoky roast malt, mocha and molasses tones. Flavor provides a strong bourbon bite, followed by roast malt, smoky, molasses, coffee and chocolate notes - a good stout indeed! Texture offers thick body and peppy fizz. This one is not for the faint of heart - or palate.\n",
      "Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Bulloq is an American stout with coffee and vanilla added brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a minimal khaki head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 7.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is light and smooth the drink. Vanilla creams and tones the chocolate complexion. Espresso bitters the take and flavors the body. Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and espresso combination. Roasted malt textures the mouthfeel and compliments the espresso. Char deepens and enriches the chocolate and roasted malt frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bulloq is a luscious American stout. The chocolate, vanilla, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and char blend together into a ravishing beer. The chocolate, espresso, and char leaves a lasting impression. The caramel and espresso dazzles the chocolate and vanilla body. The roasted malt and char applies a tantalizing touch to the mouthfeel. I loved drinking this beer and found it to go down easy for a stout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",
      "I poured it from the bottle into a tulip.  It pours black with a tan head and lacing.  The aroma is great.  You get maple syrup, bourbon, wood, chocolate, and coffee.  The taste is the same.  This is dangerously smooth and delicious.  This is a great sipping beer.  Everything is done nicely.  Nothing is over the top.\n",
      "My bottle label rated it at 12.4% (2019 vintage). Willettized Coffee Stout has a medium, beige head, a very dark brown appearance, with tight bubbles, ascending up the sides of the glass, and marginal lacing. The aroma is of whiskey barrel, coffee, cream, cocoa, and very dark malts, the flavor is the same, and bitterness plays no role, here. Mouthfeel is high medium, and Willettized Coffee Stout finishes slightly on the dry side. RJT\n",
      "Purchase in a variety pack from my local Stater Brothers. Average 10 head on top of a opaque near black body. It smells sweet really really sweet. It tastes sweet this kind of like a high alcohol burning taste at the end Ditmars and otherwise perfect beer.\n",
      "Purchase in a variety pack from my local Stater Brothers. Thick brown head on top of a dark dark Amber body. It smells sweet like molasses. It's sweet with no taste of hops on pallet. There's no little dreaded aftertaste it's quite refreshing after drinking a bunch of ipas.\n",
      "Taste sweet, with a hint of caramel. I love dark beers and this is my favorite by far. Buy it and enjoy!\n",
      "Will, Jared and Nick reviewed this beer on episode 70 of the Peaceful Treason Podcast for our weekly \"Cerveza of the Week\" segment.  This is the first beer that we and our guest all gave a perfect \"10/10\" score.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouthfeel and the taste of this beer are the crown jewels.  It's one of the most pleasant stouts available on the market, if you are lucky enough to find one.  The aging process in barrels that had stored both whiskey and syrup makes for one of the most unique flavors ever achieved in a stout.\n",
      "Can from Total Wine in San Jose.  Beautiful hazy yellow color thick lasting dense white foam.  Nice light peach aromatics.  Very fruity hops.  Low bitterness.  Easy to drink.  Very good.\n",
      "The Dark Knight, not the Dark Knight Returns. These are different beers, and The Dark Knight didn't seem to exist on Ratebeer.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dark Knight is a Bourbon Barrel aged porter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Black in color. Very boozy aroma and taste. Malty, sweet, and strong Bourbon Barrel flavor. The pour is small (5 ounce), and they are saying the alcohol 15.5% this year.\n",

      "50cl bottle. A hazy yellow golden colour, white head. Aroma of fresh citric lemonade. Taste of citrus lemonade, sugar, no beer, refreshing.\n",
      "# 1711; 12/2019. Malty aroma. Gold body. Sweet, grainy, citrus, candy. Finish is very candy. Very poor german pilsner. 0,5 l bottle, shop, Schönsee (D).\n",
      "Z butelki poszło jakąś stęchlizną piwniczną, uff. Piana jasno brązowa, wybiła średnia, złożona z drobnych i średnich pęcherzy, powoli się redukowała, lekko szyła. zredukowała się do odrobiny na powierzchni. Kolor ciemnego brązu, trunek przejrzysty. Aromat no znów idzie lekko oborą, piwnicą, są też słód, pieczarki, karmel, ale to tak mocno na obrzeżach. Smak lekko skwaśniały, gdzieś w tle jest słód, do tego może odrobina chmielu. Nie raczej to wszystko mocno słabe, nie da się pić niestety.\n",
      "Something is miss with this beer, sampled off the tap in the High Point Liberty location. Mild aroma of orange peel, gym sweat, and mint. Tastes a lit like undercooked malt. Virtual no hop presence aside from undefined hints of mint. No reall English malt character. Sloppy.  Needs a lot of work.\n",
      "Rating this after sampling perhaps the worst thing I ever tasted, so I'll probably be generous here. This has to be a Food Lion can. Giant one too. Clear gold, lots of bubbles up the side, soft white head. Nose of corn, metal, light trash water. Flavor is sweet grasses, artificial sweetener, bread crust, plastic. This is bad... shocker.\n",
      "Can thanks to Drake. I've been advised I might not survive this one. Pours off-clear, few bubbles, no head. Looks like slightly dirty water. The smell is bad... copper pipe, plumbing issues, light pear. Aww. That flavor is awful. Old copper pipe water, very metallic, light soap, light pear. This is undrinkable. I concur: these people should be ashamed of themselves.\n",
      "Really tough to even sample this due to the mega attack of awful spices. Nutmeg and cinnamon to name just a few. Unbearable. Cough syrup.\n",
      "# 712; 4/2017. Prázdný, sladký tmavý pivo s nevýraznou šveštkovou vůní. Nic, co by si člověk rád koupil znova.\n",
      "# 711 et # 868; 4/2017 et 9/2017. Velmi sladký, silný ležák. Sladový, kořenitý, mírně maltózový. Na hraně pitelnosti.\n",
      "Japaneese people migh be proud of many things, unfortunately the beer is not one of those things, that's for sure!! The worse could be only a rainwater from a rooftop. Avoid it at all costs. They don't bother calling it \"masterpiece\".\n",
      "Generic aroma and watery taste, light color, fuzzy like a summer lemonade. Sad thing is that many  countries brew like this (now I am not talking about craft beer scene): Spain - Estrella, Greece etc. Did you try pilsner or some ale or any Belgian beer? Watch and learn boys.....\n",

      "flavor is sort of like browncakes, also fainter roasted malts. ever so slightly flowery or citrussy too, could be hops.\n",
      "a bit boring , i think a heavier load of roasted malts would improve on things. comes off as slighlty thin and somewhat boring. Of course, done this way, you get more of the notes from the wood, which is what is special about this beer in the first place.\n",
      "reminds me of english low abv stout in general, so if you're into that, then this one is not bad at all.\n",
      "Underlying beer is nice and smooth and creamy, a bit of oxidation though. But the mild roast is nice. GBBF Winter\n",
      "Bottle poured a clear reddish amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of caramel, carrots and nuttiness. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of caramel, nuttiness and carrots with a crisp dry lingering carrot cake finish.\n",
      "On tap.  It poured a cloudy orange color with a white head.  The aroma was of citrus, hops and florals.  The taste was similar to the aroma with more citrus, hops, florals, pine, malts with medium carbonation and a nice bitter sweet aftertaste.  Good stuff.\n",

Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt and pecans with a smooth dry lingering chocolate pecan finish.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 3.5%. Near-opaque yellow. Small, swiftly-disappearing head. Faint bready tangerine aroma. Moderate- carbonation. Very light grapefruit notes and a hint of passion fruit.  Rather nondescript malt lurking. There could perhaps even be a splash of the alleged tangerine in there, but the most prominent flavour is a plain hop tartness. Possibly Simcoe? Somewhat puts me in mind of Cloudwater's Simcoe + Green Tea soda...I daren't say more. Not bad for the ABV, and even something of a grower,  but a bit light for my tastes. Still, that's what it's going for, so i can't really knock this. Would be great on a sunny day - which it is.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Ultramørk amber /svart. Skumring med litt farge. Lett krydderaroma. Smaken sjokolade med litt krydder i bakgrunnen. Lett tørr avslutning.\n",
      "On tap.  It poured a black color with a tan head. The aroma was of  coffee, chocolate and malts. The taste was similar to the aroma with more coffee, chocolate, malts, some raisins with mild carbonation and a nice chewy aftertaste.  Not bad.\n",
      "16 oz. can poured a murky gold with a small lasting creamy white head. Aromas of straw, yeast, fruitiness, citrus and pine. Palate was light bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of straw, yeast, citrus, dankness and pine with a smooth dry bitter lingering dank finish.\n",

People wouldn’t touch this beer at the time, due to its “crazy” strength.  Seems pretty tame now.  Not really sure whether this wasn’t just Abbot ale with some extra brewing sugar thrown in to up the alcohol content.\n",

      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 11/11/2007.  Malty and slightly toasted note in the flavour.  Very Slight roasty finish.\n",
      "Relatively clean, nice smooth creamy body, light a great drinkability. Mild roast with a nice mouthfeel. GBBF Winter\n",
      "Cask at The Combermere Arms, Wolverhampton on 10/11/2007.  Couldn’t get it much fresher.  Was a decent, malt forward bitter with some light herbal hop notes.\n",
      "Cask at The Combermere Arms, Wolverhampton on 10/11/2007.  It’s a fairly unusual style, with McMullen AK being the only other common one I can think of from this time.  Malt forward, with caramel, cereal and grain notes.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy amber color with white head. Aroma is juicy fruits, oxidized, peach. Taste is sweet creamy, juicy fruits. Oily mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not for me.\n",
      "Super dry, true to cold brewed coffee, crisp, clean, super drinkable for a strong stout. GBBF Winter\n",
      "Tap. Hazy brown color with beige head. Aroma is cherries, chocolate, mildly roasty. Taste is the same, a bit bready. Thick mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Alright.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Svart. Middels høyt tett skum med litt farge. Kaffearoma. Smaken mere kaffe. Resten er bare kaffe. Med litt godvilje dukket det opp hint av sjokolade etter hvert.\n",

      "Tap at BKL2020. Sulphuric Kellerbier nose, hazy pale golden, big fluffy creamy head, medium light body, quick fruity leaf finish. Cant say I got much extra from the hop.\n",
      "Cask at By the Horns Brewery, Summerstown.  A light golden bitter.  These Bullian hops are a little spicy and savoury, which gives the beer a fairly unusual flavour.  I just think it’s a bit too weak a beer to properly balance out the hop flavours.\n",
      "Tap. Hazy golden color with eggshell head. Aroma is a bit buttery, fruity hops. Taste is a bit buttery, not in the bad way. Thick creamy mouthfeel with soft carbonation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Clear golden, lasting, thin, white head. Aroma of grass, apple peel, unripe pear, herbs, yeast. Taste has sweetish apple & pear, quite bready & yeasty, subtle sour accent; bitter, grassy hoppy finish, bit yeasty & fruity. Medium body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. Assertive bitter Helles.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 4.8%. Medium pretty short-lasting head. Mostly-clear gold. Sweetcorn aroma. Moderate carbonation. Some sweetcorn flavour, but more prominent honeyed notes on a robust white bready malt. Nice, authentic-tasting Helles. Cloudwater can pat themselves on the back for this one, and I found it pleasant enough considering I'm rather fussy about the style.\n",
      "Bottle. Clear golden color. Small size, white head, stays. Sour, sweet, brett, woody, dry hops in aroma/taste. Drinkable brew.\n",
      "one of the pioneers in beer world. i cannot imagine any other beer with this much smokey aroma and taste\n",
      "De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En almuerzo, cumple de asun hija (9 años) Con bacalao dorado de calamocha + filetes de pollo. Version de 2019. Sobresaliente aun con unos meses encima. Herbal, resinosa y acaramelada, de una manera suave pero asertiva. Deja con ganas de mas\n",
      "Keg at the 2020 Manchester Beer Festival. Black pour with a light tan head. Dark chocolate, coconut and sweet tobacco aroma. Lots of liquorice in the taste,more sweet tobacco,cocoa. Rich,sweet warming finish.\n",

      "Hazy golden colour with a thin white head.\n",
      "Aroma is hops, citrus, tropical fruits.\n",
      "Taste is hops, citrus, mango, pineapple.\n",
      "Medium body, average carbonation.\n",
      "Bottle, 0.50l. Aroma of smoked ham, leather, roasted malt and wood. Pours clear dark amber brown color with medium sized creamy tan-like head and average sparkling appearance. Taste starts with medium sweet roasted and smoked malt and caramel, following is leathery, earthy and grassy, mouthfeel is smooth while finish is medium bitter. Medium body, oily texture and average carbonation in palate. Smoke & fly...\n",
      "Deep, dark brown color with a tan head.  Deep roasted malt, dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee flavors, with just enough malt sweetness and a pretty strong hops bitterness for a stout.  Malpais Stout almost reminds me of a cross between a stout and a porter.  Excellent and very easy drinking.\n",
      "Es divertida tomarla. Son sabores y aromas diferentes mezclados haciendo que cada sorbo le encuentres algo diferente al paladar.\n",
      "No tomaría más de 2 en una misma noche lol. Chills!!\n",
      "El primer encuentro con el sentido del olfato es agradable aún cuando logras percibir la fragancia al alcohol. Una vez en boca te conecta con sabores a café, chocolate y en mi opinión tiene un sabor a madera ahumada. El color y el cuerpo de la misma son los tradicionales en una cerveza oscura. El último sorbo se siente más amargo y más tibio en el paladar. Recomiendo disfrutarla sola sin ningún acompañamiento de comida y a temperatura de 11°C. Chills!!!\n",
      "On tap. Pours a deep orange mahogany with little head. Aromas of forest berries, forest floor and dull wheaty malts. Flavors of sharp forest berries, spruce, lemons and sharp wheaty malts\n",
      "Taster on Weathered. \n",
      "Appearance: hazy deep golden with no head.\n",
      "Aroma: moderately sweet grapes, some wild character, some barrels and honey.\n",
      "Taste: along the same lines, pretty acidic, though.\n",
      "Overall: a bit too acidic for me, but it has a nice character.\n",
      "12 oz can to tulip. Aroma of orange, fig, pineapple, light caramel malt. Taste of same with lemon-lime-grapefruit citrus. Sadly disappointed from the hype.\n",
      "Deep black, thick pour. Tan foam crown. Smoky, sweet nose. Emergence of big bourbon notes. Molasses, maple syrup, anise, pepper, dark roast coffee come to mind. First sip is cloying sweetness, followed by undisguised alcohol burn and then culminating in a potent bourbon finish. Some coffee grinds and maple flavors. At over 11% this beer retains a lot of nice flavor and locks in a tasty balance of sweetness and booziness. Unfortunately the alcohol content is not well concealed. Nonetheless, this one is well worth picking up if you see it out in the wild.\n",

      "750 ml bottle from Side Project. Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with a small brown head that settles into a ring and just a bit of very thin film. Notes of cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, ancho chile pepper - but pretty modest, roasted malts, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, and earth. Full-bodied, with modest carbonation and a rich, sweet, moderately spicy mouthfeel. Great heft and balance. Well executed and satisfying. So much to love here in another awesome Vibes variant.\n",
      "Can at home bought from Beergium.com. the beer poured hazy / thick. It was one hell of a beer. It was citrusy,  piney & juicy\n",
      "Split bottle from Brusin’ Ales - Pours pitch with a chocolate head. Lots of lacing. This is so well balanced and yummy. It’s subtle bourbon barrel aging, vanilla, chocolate, caramel and joy. Seriously so yummy.\n",
      "Bottle from Appalachian Vintner. Pours black with a thin khaki head. Lots of bourbon flavor on the nose and tongue. Lovely thickness on the mouth along with the vanilla and coconut on the edges. Drinks very easy.\n",
      "This beer is a legend.  Well balanced.  Nice citrus notes.  Clean, crisp, refreshing.\n",
      "Excellent hazy yellow, fruity hoppy smell hits like a wall. Says 10% ABV, drinks like its half that. Chasing ghosts indeed.\n",
      "Cracking this with two good mates on my 40th birthday as a night cap after a day of solid beer drinking. This big, bad boozy bastard is a huge beer. It’s thick and warming. It’s quite sweet, almost molasses in sickly sweetness. I understand why this is so highly sought after, it’s a great beer and a perfect way to end my 40th birthday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smells like a wine Black & Mild cigarillo. Heavy notes of vanilla, stewed berries, pipe tobacco, and faint spice. Very sweet, tangy mouthfeel with a bite. Long haunting finish. Crazy good.\n",
      "Pours opaque coffee with a thick tan head that leaves generous lacing. Aroma provides rich peanut and chocolate notes, plus roast malt, coffee and a touch of molasses. Flavor yields peanut butter, chocolate, roast malt, quality coffee, woody and bitter hops, a little molasses. Texture presents firm, creamy body and lively fizz with a roasty, peanut and chocolate finish. Now this is how a brewery otter celebrate its anniversary!\n",
      "Purchased at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Anadromous is a black sour ale brewed with Summit hops and triple fermented in French oak foeders, Pinot noir, and whiskey barrels crafted by Anchorage Brewing Company from Anchorage, Alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aroma of chocolate, Pinot noir, whiskey, and fair Brettanomyces yeast funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark purplish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black currants tarts the take and flavors to the drink. Pinot noir wine fills the complexion and is prominent on the dry, lactic finish. Whiskey adds a boozy undertone to the wine. Chocolate malt infuses with the wine and whiskey body. Toffee is light and compliments the chocolate. Figs are noticeable with the malt and boosts the malt texture. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plums are tangible with the toffee and yeasty combination. Brettanomyces yeast brings a leathery funk to the mouthfeel. Saccharomyces yeast brings out the chocolate while Lactobacillus assists with the tart punctuation. Summit hops spices the comprehension and adds onto the tart and lactic take. Oak applies a woodsy touch to the chocolate malt and Pinot noir wine feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anadromous is a voluptuous black sour ale. The chocolate malt, black currants, Summit hops, and Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts sets this sour ale apart from the sour market. The spicy Summit hops, tart black currants, and lactic yeasts dazzles the take. The Saccharomyces yeast slightly sweetens the chocolate and toffee frame. The Pinot Noir wine gleams the complexion and is the focal point of the craft beer. The boozy whiskey makes this sour ale easier to drink. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its colorful bouquet of flavors. For the consummate sour beer fan, the tart and sour comes across as a 2.7 out of 5; and 3.4 out of 5 for a newcomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.\n",
      "Nera, impenetrabile. Forte aroma di caffè, in bocca l'amaro iniziale lascia spazio via via al resinosa della botte, per arrivare al dolce del bourbon. Vaniglia, caffè e cacao, esplodono nel sorso. Equilibratura perfetta, carbonatazione leggerissima, beva quasi semplice per gli 11.9ABV. Spettacolo puro.\n",
      "Bottle, 2015 vintage. Dark brown color with a red shine, and thick creamy head, slowly disappearing. Aroma is immediately vinous, brandy, berries. taste is a mix of sour and sweet notes, perfectly balanced, vinousfruity, lactic acid. Quite low carbonation, full body, viscous/oily texture. The 13% alcohol is really well hidden, very complex beer but with quite an easy drinkability. Delicious.\n",
      "Excellent beer the only trappist ale produced in the UK rearly enjoyed this will buy again trappist beers are some of the best as the monks know, what there doing when it comes to beer as they have been doing it since the medieval times\n",
      "une bière bien noire et bien visqueuse. Un col brun cerne le verre. Une mousse qui reprend de la vigueur aux légères secouées. Une dentelle au deuxième service. C'est du grain grillé, du houblon, du bois brûlé, des herbes sèches et des piments forts comme bouquet. C'est un liquide suave et riche qui transporte des saveurs de café, de mélasse verte, de whisky américain et ce, juste bien dosé. On a l'impression que le liquide s'est installé en bouche pour y rester et se prélasser. C'est un liquide qui est en constante évolution du point de vue des saveurs. C'est succulent! (2984-211219)\n",

      "375mL bottle, pours a deep dark amber, no head. Nose is all oxidation, balsamic, and acidic acid. Flavour is mega-oxidized, with lots of cardboard, acetic acid, and balsamic. Oxidized as fuck. Nasty.\n",
      "Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this. Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice crystal clear super pale straw hue with no discernible head. Aromas of light yeast funk, definitely dry not sweet. Minimal apple aroma.  Taste is similar to the nose, little funky, bone dry. I get a nice wave of crisp fresh apples before being inundated with off flavours along the line of plastic bandaids. Ugh. Sweeter apples try to break through but that really, really aggressive and unpleasant boarding on burnt plastic and rubber cuts through it all. Finish is bone dry but the carbonation is next to nothing. This might be one of the worst ciders I've had.\n",
      "surprised that a BRUT IPA is only 4.3%. that means an OG of ~1.033 i'd guess. wow youre cheap as fuck.\n",

      "golden with a fair white head. aroma is that typical fruity hop shit. taste is not tart, but more just like a dry \"ICE\" style lager. harsh, confusing. can says b\"champagne yeast\", however that would not be enough and in fact lol less than helpful in achieving a true brut-IPA FG... so ? oddly harsh and unpleasant balance. def would not get again in short.\n",

      "Giant can from food lion, I’m sure. Murky chocolate ham tasting: me casa. Mostly clear gold with a soft white head that quickly dissipates. Inoffensive aroma of corn, water that’s sat in cooper pipes for decades, grasses. Could have been much worse. But good god it should be better. Flavor is envelope glue, corn, grasses, rubbing alcohol.\n",
      "Giant can from food lion. This was going to be a milestone beer but I just couldn’t wait. Murky chocolate ham tasting.  Pours pink. Just pink. Smells like magic, death, and childhood. Perhaps some wet or even dead dog. maybe both. Flavor is watermelon, 99% sugar water, and some strange somewhat toxic-like flavors.\n",
      "Abomination shared by hershiser2 at the Murky Chocolate Ham tasting. Aroma of fake watermelon candy and not much else. Maybe some Cotton candy. Taste is sugar, watermelon candy, cotton candy. Gross.\n",

      "31-01-20 // taster at Braukunst Live! From a bottle. Pours unclear pinkish red. Distinct cider yeast aromas in the nose along a raspberry aroma. Good fruity sourness and well embedded yeast aromas.\n",
      "I have purchased this beer, at Wittisch Getränk market, at Olten. Drinking and enjoying this bottle yesterday after the birthday of my daughter. The body is copper/brown and a bit troubled, average carbonation, a bit crispy, white foam. In my point of view, it is an interesting ipa, you have probably a touch of citra, mineral, hay, side of tobacco, touch of lychee, fruity and dry, malt, hoppy and citrus.\n",
      "375 mL bottle. Pours yellow and a little hazy. Smells of, amazingly, pilsner malt right up front. White wine behind it, and very sauvignon blanc-y. Tastes of sharp white wine acidity. Oak. Pilsner malt is still there, but lost to acidity and white wine. Medium body. The layers are a little muddled on the palate, at least by comparison to how discrete they are on the nose.\n",
      "Nice deep brown color to it with some reddish highlights, pours with three fingers of light brown colored, rocky looking head that has a good retention to it that leaves a nice skim on the surface of the glass, leaves no lacing but has some slight legs running down the sides. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fairly sweet aroma to it of dark fruits and syrup with hints of spices and brandy that give a slight fruitcake impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forward is fairly malty and quite sweet, medium/ heavy bodied with a slightly above average amount of carbonation to it and a nice toffee flavor to it with a solid mouthfeel, as well as a light fruity reduced grape note almost a bit like ice wine with faint hints of honey, dates and, trace of plum and rum raisin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Back end has spicy hints of black pepper, cayenne and cloves as well as a lightly leafy, tobacco hop note and a sweet brandy finish with a whisper of heat to it leaving a lingering sweet toffee, raisin and tobacco aftertaste to it and a slight boozy warmth spreading out to the limbs.\n",
      "500 mL bottle. Pours clear and very pale yellow. Smells of soft doughy malt and light spicy hop. Tastes of bready and lightly sweet dough. Light spicy hops throughout but I keep expecting it to peak with a spicy bite, but never does. Very light. It hints a hefty hop back end it but drops off in favor of a delicate malt flavor.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 4.3%. Sheer pastel orange with a picturesque head, decent duration. Orange juice aromas with some mango undertones and perhaps a hint of grapefruit. Lowish carbonation. Primarily orange-juicy, helped by the mouthfeel, with a pale malt serving to add very slight, gentle pithiness. Some slight mango tropical tints too. Smooth, sweet, bland in a good way - it's a bit like vanilla - sure it's plain, but who doesn't like vanilla? Especially well done vanilla. This is well done vanilla. Classic easy-drinker with classic hops, and just has that touch of class in how it's all put together that makes this absolutely, evidently craft and not supermarket fare. Balance of bitter and sweet is spot on too. I've had a lot of craft Pales that didn't quite meet the mark set here in sheer execution. But still, it's vanilla. Don't expect the world and this will do right by your tastebuds.\n",

      "Dark, Clean, Tan Beerhead, with thin, frothy, and lacing foam. OK retention. Having hoppy flavors and roasted malts characters at the same time, great balance between them, and different performances from cold to ambient temperature. Like coffee, toffee, plums, dark caramel, and slightly vanilla hints on the tasting. On the other hand, grapefruit, pine and  tropical fruits in the smell.\n",
      "Aroma : Toasted caramel malts with a grassy hop undertone.  Taste : Toasted sweet caramel malts up front, balanced by soft bittering hop finish. Better than average Irish Red (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Very dark brown with cream head. There is a pleasing fruitiness to this porter, dark roasted malts with a bitter nuttiness, some chocolate. Sweet in the close. Decent beer.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Amber with white head. Cannot believe I hadn't had this before but glad I came across it now. Full and hoppy in character, orange bitterness, peel and zest, citrusy, grapefruit juice flavours. Good depth of flavour, hides the ABV well. A cracker.\n",
      "Aroma : Notes of caramel & bready malt, citrus orange, grapefruit & some pine.  Taste : Lightly sweet caramel malt nicely balanced by bitter citrus. Not special but easily drinkable (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazy golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of mango, zesty hops, mild citrus and light cereal/grain. Similar flavor, adding mild bitterness and mild sweetness with a hint of cinnamon at the finish. Interesting.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Very dark brown with cream head. There are sour notes in this from the off, acidic lactose with soured plum flavours, damson notes. The darker roasted malts do come through, some nutty hints. Not sure about sour porter but this is fine.\n",

      "Light lemon colour with white head, typical lager profile with some minor spice on the nose. A crisp lager that’s easy to drink, not a fan of the herbal/spice thing through the palate\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There is a light fruitiness to this, malt lead, lightly grainy then tropical fruit hopped notes. Pineapple and Mango flavours. Easy on the palate. Pretty reasonable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Aroma : Toasty malts with hints of chocolate, caramel, cookies & nut.   Taste : Thin body leading to thin caramel malt taste, not picking up much else. Very average…Lacks depth (Florida tour Nov 18)\n",
      "Cask conditioned at GBBF Winter, New Bingley Hall, Hockley, Birmingham. Gold with white head. There is a light fruitiness to this with  a pleasant fruity, dry hopped note. The ginger came through qute late for me but was more obvious for others on the table. Drying in the close. Pretty reasonable.\n",

      "Aroma : Light caramel malt, unusual sweet orange note rather than citrus orange.  Taste : Malt is sublte, sweet orange comes through and although not overpowring, for me lacks some bittering balance. Still an o.k. beer though (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",

      "Bottle pour at Protokoll, pours a deep dark mahogany, no head. Aroma is intensely complex, work lots of red wine, red grapes, dates, and a touch of candi sugar. Flavour is decadent and rich, with cocoa, molasses, dates and a touch of red wine grape. Intensely rich and extremely harmonious. This is an absolute gem.\n",
      "Bottle pour at Protokoll, pours a clear pale blonde, no head. Aroma is loaded with raisins upfront, followed by intense vanilla beans, and treacly honey. Flavour is exquisite, revealing vanilla beans, maple syrup, and dark raisins upfront, giving way to the decadent honey. Unbelievably complex, with all the additions working harmoniously.\n",
      "440ml can. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma of peanut butter, biscuit wafer, chocolate. Taste is intensely biscuity, wafer, peanut butter, very sweet, rich, chocolate, caramel, hint of roast, like a cross between a KitKat, Snickers and Forrero Rocher in beer form. Full bodied, very thick, very smooth. Wasn't expecting a Yellow Belly beater but here we are. In a league of it's own. And I don't even like peanut butter. This is so good.\n",

      "Many thanks for this Oude Kriek to tderoeck. Vintage 2015. Limited Edition Bottle and with Certificate TSG sign (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed). My version was 7,2% ABV. Moj termometr do wina wskazywal 11 stopni C. Podane W koszyczku Cantillona, rozlane do 2 kieliszkow do burgundzkiego czerwonego wina i jednego kieliszka do wisniowego lambic'ka. Alez sie zapienilo niczym plyn do kapieli pod goracym strumieniem. Jak na lambica to tu piana niebywale spora i trwala, barwa czerwona z lekka metnoscia poczatkowo pod koniec degustacji bardzo metne jak smiksowane maliny w moim mikserze. Przejdzmy do aromatu, wisnie i jeszcze raz wisnie, smak wisnia rozlupane pestki, bardzo pestkowe, kwasne wyraznie owocowe, taniczne, sciagajace, lekka slodycz ale dominuje wytrawnosc, cierpkosc nieco skory i potu. Doskonalej klasy swiatowy lambick. Tak to smakuja Schaarbeeksowe wisienki. Cudo w ustach. To doskonale czerwone piwo pasowalo idealnie do takze czerwonego miesa, Wolowina duszona w sosie grzybowym i surowka z pekinskiej kapusty. Pychotka. More, more, more. Thx Tim for that Limited Bottle.\n",

Aftertaste: nice bitterness, gentle roast, bit hoppy, lots of vanilla, chocolate.\n",

      "440ml can. Pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma of coconut, chocolate, vanilla. Taste is very rich and sweet, massive coconut, loads of chocolate and vanilla, coffee is on the lighter side bringing a little roast and even littler amount of bitterness to counter the sweetness, wish the coffee was a little stronger, finish is boozy, warming. Full bodied, very thick, and very smooth. An outstanding stout, and the best beer Track have ever made so far.\n",

Små små krämiga bubblor som lyfter smakerna,. Satans så välbalanserad bourbon/choklad stout . En av de godaste ölen jag testat 👍👍👍.GALET GOD. Åh mer Välbalansead öl har jag nog inte testat. Gillar du inte kvalite och lyxig bourbon ja då gillar du nog inte denna . Annars kommer du som jag, bara tänka och prata hela kvällen om denna galet goda öl.\n",

Hur får de bara till det??\n",

      "this is one delicious double IPA, you don't taste the IBU's or the ABV.  It has a slight sweetness and a nice orange/amber color.  No head to speak of and the aroma is mild hops. It tastes like a 7% and about 60 IBU's.  This beer could get you in trouble quick. One of my favorites!\n",

      "White can as pictured. $2 at vintage. Very bitter and very fizzy. Rude, like many IPA, perhaps a little veggie in there. What does monk fruit taste like? I'll have tah git one from the grocers. Anyway, this is simply a big bitter beer and if monk fruit is supposed to sweeten it, I'm not sure. What ever. Nasty nellie. Smells like contemporary IPA.\n",
      "This “root beer” doesn’t taste like a root beer. It tastes like a sparkling dip cup. Honestly, the wintergreen is so strong, it was incredibly reminiscent of Skoal Wintergreen spit. Would not recommend to anyone. I poured the entire 6 pack out after one sip. Wouldn’t gift to people I hated. Would give 0/10 if I could.\n",

      "On n'est pas loin d'avoir touché le fond avec cette Turbeau Noir, dont le nom est trompeur car il s'agit ici d'une bière fruitée par adjonction de concentré de fruits des bois. On ne parle donc pas ici de fruits des bois ayant macéré dans le brassin mais bien d'un ajout de concentré, ce qui n'est tout de même pas la panacée. La base est de plus complètement ratée. Avec un ajout de fruits sucrés, une petite acidité est nécessaire afin de couper le sucre et donner du peps à l'ensemble. Ici la base est sucrée, ce qui rend le tout sur-sucré, et en lus sans finesse, sans complexité, et sans intérêt si ce n'est de conférer des arômes de caramel, et de cola quelque peu chimique. Je ne vois pas quelle est la cible de cette bière. Le visuel se porte sur un brun un peu rosâtre surmonté d'une mousse brune d'un cm. Même si le nez n'est pas exceptionnel, finalement celui-ci n'est pas si mal vu la dégustation avec un cocktail de fruits des bois, de caramel et une fraîche amertume. Malheureusement l'amertume ne permet pas d'équilibrer la sucrosité à la dégustation ce qui la rend lourde et écœurante, surtout que les arômes quelque peu chimiques ne sont pas agréables. L'alcool à 8 % ne se ressent pas du tout et ne donne aucun caractère. Corpulence et longueur sont plutôt bonnes, mais à quoi bon? J'ai déjà trop écrit et donc perdu mon temps pour ce breuvage.\n",

      "Baby blue can for $250 at vintage boarbman, nice place. Decent wet-waxy pour with a thicker foamy head. Smell of volatile citrus IPA is permeating the immediate area. Thicker deep resinous palate, viscous. Nasty nellie negative nightmare on the taste buds, this stuff must be double imperial IPA, no lie!  Quite a ball buster. So thick so rich and terribly on trippel IPA style, man this is a slap in the face. Whew. Haven't had one of these rubber inner tube chewed soaked in pine tar sap for a long long time, so big, so fat it kicked may ass. Love IPA? Ignore my numbers, you got to seek this out, its straight up bullshit ass wide hops like making me see stars with every swig! There, you have it!! Big bitter impact clear to the end and even a half hour later, taste does not like to fade. Kowahbungah. Something that most pale lager lovers may not be able to endure.\n",
      "Just like the original, I just don't get this beer.  It has some peanut butter flavor, but also tastes just dirty.  The color is fine but the flavor is just bad.  Don't get the love.\n",
      "Really really nasty. Like cold watered down hot chocolate that has gone off. When I didn't finish the pint (I only had a few sips) the pub lady asked me what I thought and when I explained my view she wholeheartedly agreed. She said that it was the least liked beer they ever had and the only one most people never finish. She also said they were never going to have it again. Avoid at all costs.\n",

      "16 ounce can. Murky mustard gold color. Two finger high frothy beige head. Nice clinging lace. Floral hop nose hints at honeysuckle and sweet citrus. Crackery malt base has a jolt of dank citrus hop flavor. Subtle creamy mouthfeel from the wheat and oats. Bitter peppery finish.\n",
      "relatively fresh can that pours clear bright gold with a large white head offering good retention and lacing. golden doughy pilsner malts twirling with soft tropical citra, but also peppery and spicy herbal notes surprisingly, super clean yeast action. moderate carbonation, light body - oily; dry citrusy-herbal finish. meant to write noble hops or gtfo, but eh, this is a great new world pilsner.\n",
      "Draught. Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with good lacing. Moderate orange and dank hops and hop bitterness, medium bread malt, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.\n",
      "341mL can, pours a hazy golden with a medium white head. Aroma reveals bright floral hops, with some citrus zest, and biscuity malt. Flavour is balanced, with citrus hops, some floral notes, and crisp biscuity malt. Nothing overly interesting, but the balance is good, and there is even a decent hop bite. Better than expected.\n",
      "Hazy golden colour with a tad orange, a warm cap, average retention and some spotted lace. Orange citrus scent with lots of fruity sweetness, tropical fruits like papaya and even hints of peach. Very smooth and silky mouthfeel. The grassiness is well-hidden from the hops in the taste, with some peppery light notes. The fruitiness does the rest. This is very, very drinkable, very good. Should be one they can, and have all of the time as their standard IPA.\n",
      "(473ml can from L'Axe du Malt, Quebec City) Pours nearly opauqe yellow-orange with an average white head. Aroma of green mango, melon, papaya, unripe guava, some sweet canned peach and orange undertones, a little leafy. Flavour is off-dry with melon, papaya and green mango most prevalent, some estery kveik fruitiness, light biscuit to the malt, finishing rather dry with quite low bitterness, a little chalky, with lingering melon and fruit peels. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Solid effort, I'd like more expression of the citra here which teases juicy but ends up a bit more on the greener side.\n",
      "(473ml can from L'Axe du Malt, Quebec City) Pours opaque dingy orange juice with a tight white cap with stability and lace. Aroma of sweet tangerine, dried mango, citrus peels, leafy hops, dank and rather green onion-y, some sweetness. Flavour is semi-sweet up front but with a lot of citrus bitters, leafy greens, melon peels competing with the tropical fruit notes. Finishes bone dry and resinous with a moderate plus bitter bite for style. Light to medium body with soft fairly smooth carbonation. Solid NEIPA but the balance is too far towards the green side for me to truly love this.\n",
      "(473ml can from Metro St Roch, Quebec City) Pours nearly clear pale gold with a rapidly fizzing head. Simple clean semi-dry cider, fresh lightly sweet and lightly tart Mcintosh apple vibes, slight skin and yeast tones, pretty mineral, dry finish. Light fizzing mouthfeel. Decent enough, bought for cooking and not objectionable to drink half the can.\n",
      "500ml bottle at home via VA.  Hazy golden orange with a lasting white head and good lacing.  Funky peach, apricot, earth, yeast, mild vinegar and brett.  Medium carb and body, creamy champagne texture.  Lingering funky finish.  Delicious.\n",

      "500ml shared by brother at home. Aroma: lots of wood, chocolate, lots of caramel, lots bourbon and alcohol coming through. App: dark brown almost black, minimal to no head, shy lacing. Taste and palate: full body but thin feeling, liquoreux, medium sweetness, lots of chocolate and caramel, light acidity and alcool burning finish. Overall: damn good. The nose and mouthfeel of this one is amazing. Not too sure where I could take away points on this bet tbh. Maybe appearance I guess? Excellent!\n",

Szép. Visszafogott szénsavasság, ezért jól érezni a komplex ízeket. Összetett, inkább komlós, picit citrusos, de mellette gyógyfüves, és édeskés is. Rendkívül finom desszert sör, az alkoholt szinte nem is érezni. Minél jobban haladsz, annál több íz jön elő. Irsai-s, pezsgős érzet, pl... Tényleg kiemelkedően komplex, mégis jól iható sör.

      "Wässriger, laff getreidiger Beginn. Trocken, wenig aromatisch, milde Herbe. Muffiges Malz, kurzer Abgang. Eine weitere Enttäuschung der Ruppaner Brauerei. 7/6/5/5/8/5\n",
      "Schon sehr verdächtig: Flaschenform und Etikette machen auf Hipp! Farbe goldgelb, Kohlensäure perlt zu leicht. Schaumkragen steht, aber dünn. Geruch ist klar: Standardlager (Einheitspfütze). Geschmack entspricht dem Geruch. Ergo: langweilige Massenproduktion!\n",
      "Smells of rotting wet socks just pulled out of the hamper in a hockey locker room, has clear yellow with little foam like you just wrung those socks out and put it in a glass. Flavour is more of that cloying rotten sock with vague citrus orange notes. Very bad aftertaste. I can't get past it reminding me of rotting rancid socks from a 23 year old semi-professional hockey player - that's just not something I want to drink.\n",
      "OK, look.  I generally like Pittsburgh brewing beers but to call this IC Light is an insult to the rock of IC Light. How fricken rude to bastardize a respected name. This is simply a light pale beer  with artificial flavors added, it is so fake it is near cloying. SO uncool. Its the balls on the barnacles at the bottom of the bombardier's barrel. First off, it looks like IC light, no color to make you think its cherry flavored.  It also smells like a cheap red Popsicle. Its fizzy and tastes something like cheap red soda, but nothing like the quality flavors of Cherokee red. Typical wan-nah be accepted new fru- fru -fruity beer. Whew. Probably should be kept out of the ratings like other stupid straight up ass soda pop flavored malt beverages. The artificial sweetener in this yields a lingering unpleasant perfume like finish  on each swig right to the end. Disappointing, not really beer; JMHO. I was fooled into buying the barn on a sixer of these pounder cans of near beer for $3 at JR's. Heheheh. Tick this one up to trying any untasted beer:  Bleah (An interjection to expresses negative feelings. The quality of the emotion bleah is expressed as more negative than that of blah and has a slight feeling of disgust, verging on nausea.)\n",

      "09-Nov-12 (12-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Nov-12 at The Bine & Vine Bottle Shop in San Diego, CA)Pours a crystal clear, radiantly golden body with half an inch of bubbly, off-white head that settles to a patchy layer and wide ring.  The nose is malty and buttery, some sourdough, not especially enticing.  Things get worse.  Flavors of cardboard, stale bread, hay, butter are wince-inducing.  Some caramely malt is in the background but it can't save an otherwise unenjoyable beer.  Light-medium in weight, medium in carbonation, reasonably dry, finishing stale and flat.  Overall, not much else to say.  This just isn't very good and not worth drinking more than necessary to get my review completed.\n",

Virtually no other aroma can make it past the wall of mouthwash. Not much better in the mouth...watery and overly sweet with mostly sourness for balance, and a dreadful aftertaste of mouthwash that won't go away. Why on earth did they put soooooo much peppermint flavoring in this??? Just plain awful.\n",

      "12 ounce bottle from Mongers. Pours a crystal clear copper color with a medium white head. A big citrus and pine nose. Rich caramel, lemon zest, some funky resin. Smooth. Tastes bigger than it is. Old school with newer notes. Essentially, a great IPA.\n",
      "Bottle from Maplewood Liquor in San Jose, CA. Aroma is  chocolate, alcohol...gin first, maybe some cognac. Taste is chocolate and again, nondescript alcohol, thick caramel, candy. Complex but also very hard to pin down. Boozy tootsie rolls? Okay!\n",
      "Аромат очень кислый и сложный. Ощущаются прежде всего овощи вроде томатов и сельдерея. Есть ассоциации на сухофрукты с намеками на мед, также сено и квашенные яблочки, в целом что то между Фландрийским и ламбиком. Цвет полу мутный, желтый, пены почти нету. Вкус такой же сложный как аромат. Сразу ощущаются нотки яблок с яблочной ноткой от дрожжей. Немного ягод, прежде всего от красной смородины. При глотке хмелевая сухость а также сильная лимонаня кислота, которая плавно перетекает в яблочки. Снова есть доля от сухофруктов а также специй, напоминает гвоздику и также перец. Алкоголь не ощущается вообще. В целом вообще очень благородное пиво, очень сложное, которое сложно пить часто, но опыт приятен.\n",
      "500ml (thx, Dan C.!) at Andrey's shared with Phill and Alex. Vintage 2019. 14.09% ABV.\n",
      "Appearance: dark brown with a beige head.\n",
      "Aroma: nice bourbon barrel, tons of chocolate, some molasses and rye.\n",
      "Taste: along the same lines, spiciness coming from the rye.\n",
      "Overall: this is very nice.\n",
      "Bottle from Market Basket\n",
      "Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge frothy white head that slowly recedes.  Huge earthy citrus and pine with bits of juicy tropical fruitiness. Solid bready toasty malt provides a bit of balance. Really tasty old/new school mix-tape.\n",

      "Short version: this beer is excellent. Balance between hops and malt, nice hop flavor and aroma, good body. Hazy with good ingredients but not clogged :D This is a keeper for sure. Buying some more of this for the holidays and family on the Western Slope\n",
      "Aroma: Roasted Coffee, light licorice, chestnut, dark chocolate, espresso Appearance: Dark, almost no see through, red glow, beige thick staying head, vast, full lace. Taste: Dark roasted coffee, chestnut, licorice, the perfect balance and not too heavy, nice malty soy aftertaste.\n",
      "Tall skinny bottle poured into a brandy snifter. The mead is a clear dark red. Still. The aroma has thick cherry skin and oaky notes. Juicy tannins and woody fruity notes. Thicker mouthfeel. Great mead!\n",
      "An absolutely stunning ale with a glorious bitter taste, coupled with toffee and a slight smokeyness to it. The aftertaste leaves a sharp sensation on the tongue, but it's not unpleasant. The smell and look is very reminiscent of a stout or porter. Definitely the best I've had from this brewery so far.\n",
      "Great Hazy IPA! I love the balance of the sweetness-to-bitterness in this one. \n",

      "My favorite from La Cumbre, and that's saying something.\n",
      "Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.\n",

      "Aroma is vanilla, chocolate and coconut. Coconut is more pronounced in the taste. Slight spice. Full, sweet, bitter. Great!\n",

      "L this beer did what it needed. Murky Pale, let’s do it again/whole bunch of west coast hops plonked into a Mashtung.\n",
      "Le nez est propre aux bonnes bières de garde avec de riches arômes de malts torréfiés, de céréales, de caramel et de levure. En bouche c’est rond, légèrement sucré, sur une base maltée bien charpentée aux saveurs de caramel et de fruits secs. La seconde bouche révèle des notes de raisins secs, d’amande amère, d’alcool et une belle amertume qui dure pour une finale longue et rafraîchissante. Une puissante bière de garde !\n",
      "This beer taste like candy!!\n",
      "Under normal circumstances (like a child’s birthday) this would be a good thing, However, it was a weird sensation and eventually a lesson in being careful for what you wish for. On the surface it was a blend of about 5 of the best hops that you would want in any beer, including my favourite the Nelson Sauvin. However its combined taste was almost like a dinner party where everyone wants to talk and no one listen. Summary with so many bold flavours aggressively punching through this beer was just too sweet.\n",
      "Metamorphism is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching. For this lovely Amarillo hopped  beer from Hampshire, that is exactly what you get. A transition. The excellent addition of oats make for a beautiful transformative taste across the entire tongue. Quite literally from the West Coast to the East in hops performance. Or was that the other way round? Who cares, I was so waisted. There is a delicacy of taste that clips the cusp of your tongue here and it makes this worth a re visit many times over. What a great APA\n",
      "We had this beer in December 2019. We bought it at Benny’s in a four pack it is absolutely amazing very delicious and definitely taste like a cinnamon roll\n",

      "750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that settles into a thick ring that curves into a film that nearly covers the liquid, with a hole on just one side. Notes of lemon, white grapes, acidity, oak, vanilla, bright funk, and herbs. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, bright, acidic mouthfeel in great balance. Really does capture both house styles well. Great collaboration.\n",

      "I bought a 4 pack of this beer and I honestly don't think I can finish it. There's something really off putting about the extremely tart, sour, overly flavored taste of this beer. I feel like I'm drinking cold dish water that someone threw a bunch of fruit rinds and other herbs and spices into with every sip. I choked my way through the first can and honestly had to just toss the last few bits of the 2nd and 3rd can bc it's just too much of a chore to drink. I'm looking at the 4th can and thinking, \"well maybe one day all the stores around me will be closed and I won't be able to buy any beer.\" Any port in a storm kind of beer. This really made me contemplate my relationship to alcohol. It's honestly that bad in my opinion. I'm giving it points only for the can design and it does have a nice cloudy appearance.\n",
      "Dark, look like coke. Drink like coffee. I hate stout. Don’t have anything like a beer. A mix of medicine and coffee.\n",

      "I have been drinking Bud light 4 years.  Now I really want 2 find a different beer. Earlier this year I called a complained a few times about the beer being flat. They were very nice. They reimbursed me.  Well, it's been HAPPENING AGAIN. I always buy the 20 pack bottles. The majority of them r flat. I am on Social Security so I dont have a lot money. Most of my extra money goes on Bud light.  I collect all things Bud light. I have thousands of Bud light bottle caps. There's just something about a nice fresh cold beer when u (Or supposed 2 hear) that sound when u open the bottle. Then comes the disappointment when there's no sound. I would say it's been the last 13 20 packs where the majority r flat and that doesn't include the 1's I complained about earlier in the year. I asked them if they have other people complaining about the same issue. They said no one. That was a lie. There r hundreds complaining about the beer being flat.\n",
      "Bottles, as masterblend supréme. Murky in color, changing over the evening, mostly low head. Boring or off-flavoured notes, oxidized, Doesn't seem to get less over a session.\n",
      "this is one of the worst beers ive ever had. horrendous combination. tasted like salsa with too much coriander, off-throwing coconut candy and vegetabley finish. did they seriously even taste this before releasing this? this is a 0 out of 5 i drank about 1/5th of the can cause i was desperate for a buzz and this was my mistaken choice and dumped the rest. holy shit that was bad. how are people actually rating this seriously?\n",

      "330ml Dose. Klar und golden mit kleiner Schaumkrone. Getreidig. Leichter Körper. Wenig aromatisch.\n",
      "Pours a clear, dark red without a head.  The aroma is intense, but not in a good way.  Smoke, peat, and extremely heavy scotch, all of which brings to mind the smell of one of those thick permanent markers.  The taste is moderately sweet with the flavors being pretty well balanced.  Smoke, peat, cherry, fig, oak, and scotch, with the scotch lingering through into the finish.  Light to medium in body and a little more thin in texture.  You are also left with a mild alcohol burn.  I don't like scotch so I'm probably biased.  If you fight past the initial impression the aroma offers, this one is drinkable.  But it isn't good.\n",

      "Bottle from Ambleside Wines, Ambleside.  Golden with a head.  It has a decent pale ale aroma, but fails to follow through in taste with just a bland hoppiness available.\n",
      "[Draught at Tapworks Pub] Pours a murky yellow-gold with an average size lasting frothy white head. Nice hoppy aroma, citrusy, piney and herbal, along with tropical fruit and sweet bready malt in the background. Nice flavour as well, follows the aroma, along with an average bitter finish. Medium bodied. This surprised me with how good it is.\n",

      "Pours a deep, dark brown with a finger of tan foam that settles to a ring, no lacing. Aromas of roast malt and a slight sweetness. Flavors are more abundant with a nice sweet toffee dominating among biscuit and mild nut presence. This is how I like brown ales - with low hop bitterness and focus on the malt. Well done!\n",
      "Aus der Flasche im 2020-02 getrunken. Diese kupferne Ale ist typisch im Englischen Stil und hat neben einer Karamellnote eine feine Hopfennote. EIn Ale was einfach Spaß im Glas macht ohne zu kompliziert zu werden.\n",

      "Had poured from bomber-size bottle. Sparkling amber-gold with a fizzy white head.  Smells of fruit - plum/peach. Taste is sweet, mildly bitter - fruity nuance a little boozy, a bit tart but not sour.\n",
      "On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL. served to a tulip showing a cloudy, orangey/gold color, a fluffy layer of soft white froth that slowly reduced to a ring, with foamy spots of lacing. The nose was soft grain, citrus as orange & lemon/lime, a bit of pit fruit, tartness & tanginess, and some agave sweetness. Medium bodied, with decent spritz to the effervescence, the taste was similar, with amped tartness & tanginess, a bit of earthy astringency, and light salinity to the finish. Very palate appealing. Like it when the flavor equals or outshines the aroma.\n",

      "A very nice imperial stout you are forced to enjoy at a thoughtful pace.\n",
      "Cloudy orange yellow.  Grassy hop aroma.  Medium body.  Alcohol well hidden.  Mildly bitter, touch of citrus and herbal hops.  It's fine.  Unmemorable.\n",
      "Hazy yellow, small white head.  Aroma on the malty side.  Medium light body.  Some up front bitterness then gets a bit sweet but without the hop intensity to balance, but finishes a little better on the dry side.  Decent, style not really as advertised.\n",
      "Had on tap at Tenaya Creek, this was delicious. Quite hazy, a ton of grapefruit flavors with a little orange.  This is the Stone quality I remember but had been missing in some recent average beers. This one is top notch! Tasty tasty.\n",
      "Dark brown with small tan head.  Aroma roasted and sweet malt.  Medium light body.  Flavor is off dry, lightly sweet malt with toasty finish.  Solid.\n",
      "This was a pretty run of the mill.  Not a ton of bittering hops, okay flavor.  Nothing special or memorable.\n",
      "Poured a hazy, light yellow colour with a bright white, creamy head. Minimal lacing. Light bouquet on the nose. With scents of cereal and light hops. First swig was really quite thin with watery flavours of very light hops, honey and a little nuts. Finish is quite plain with minimal lingering flavours.\n",
      "Acquired a can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom! Can date of 1-23-20. Aroma shows apricot, peach, house yeast. Surprised at the lasting grassy note through the melon and fruit. Texture has a massively juicy center that turns dry. Alcohol is not here. Well above average! \n",
      "\n",
      "Cherries and lime and not too sour.  Perhaps the extra alcohol helps, because I found this more drinkable than most in this style.\n",
      "An American Lager with no bitter aftertaste. Clean but not overpowering Lemon and Ginger flavor. A Light & Crisp finish. Doesn't weigh you down. Perfect for a warm afternoon or just relaxing at home or with your friends. High Recommended if you are an America Lager Fan.\n",

      "De “Great Divide” la iconica American Imperial Stout \"Yeti” sin duda parámetro actual del estilo, la etiqueta presume un volumen de alcohol de 9.5% y en amargor 75 IBU's, la productora de esta etiqueta es una de las pioneras en el mundo moderno de la cerveza artesanal americana, fundada en Denver año 1994 por Brian Dunn, “Yeti” es una de sus recetas emblema llena de premios y un vivo ejemplo del perfil barroco y saturado que empezó a buscar el cervecero norteamericano como identidad propia y sello característico, abajo una breve descripción de lo que fue degustar esta Ale obscura. \n",
      "\n",
      "En vista propone una corona de espuma amplia matizada de un tono canela y compuesta de perlas pequeñas a medianas, poca retención, el color del líquido ronda la escala más alta del SRM, sin transparencias un obscuro profundo. \n",
      "\n",
      "En aroma presenta notas a chocolate, pan quemado, café amargo, carácter a jerez, vainilla, un poco de frutos como ciruela pasa, ligeramente resinosa, la potencia es considerablemente fuerte, muy marcado el carácter de la malta. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ya en paladar es espesa, tiene un cuerpo pleno, sabores a frutos secos como pasas, café amargo, chocolate del mismo carácter, un poco de dulzor símil al caramelo, un poco terrosa, jerez, también vainilla, amargor pronunciado y casi al final toque resinoso, el alcohol genera algo de calidez en garganta y esófago pero es tolerable y aceptable en el estilo, final seco, regusto de larga duración, sin duda sigue siendo un buen exponente, me encantó y es justo como a mi me gustan las Imperial Stout.\n",
      "23.5 oz can. Pours a clear blue raspberry candy color with a tiny white head that vanished instantly. No lacing. Nose of sugar and booze. Tastes like sugar and booze too. Super sticky sweet start followed by a semi-harsh boozy finish. Pure alco-pop.\n",
      "Ohhh Mickey’s.. I can’t count how many darkened days and sunny nights you’ve gotten me through. You truly are the FINEST of malt liquors.\n",
      "Best beer so far and by far! \n",
      "I tried so many other beers and I'm not saying that they all bad but the STEEL RESERVE is by far the best! I like the full aroma, great taste over all! \n",
      "The perfect beer for somebody who likes it a bit heavier and hoppier!\n",
      "Can from Whole Foods Market Blossom Hill in San Jose, CA. Aroma is chocolate liqueur, dark chocolate, bourbon.  Taste is rich dark chocolate, some espresso, bourbon darkness and vanilla. Extremely rich, balanced and beyond.\n",
      "Poured to a 1/2” head and had a deep honey-brown color. Taste was much better than anticipated and enjoyed it very much. I will definitely purchase this beer again.\n",
      "Bottle pours hazy pale yella. Grape must aroma. Sour white wine, citrus. Not getting the pils much but the white wine and basement sour is real nice.\n",
      "Fun little bottle of rum barreled bomb. Picked up a few at a recent cellar sale at Molly’s. As always with bombs, great nose and super dark. \n",

      "\n",
      "Very dark brown, a few light tan bubbles.  Aroma is strong cocoa powder, hint of vanilla and toasted nuts; just a perfect aroma.  Taste is magnificent--smooth dark melted chocolate, pecan pie filling, the barest hint of minerality and spice (almost minty), clean dry finish.  \n",

      "Black hue with a thin tan head. Rich spirited aroma of brandy and sweet oak and roasty dark malts and a bit of cocoa butter and deep bitter dark chocolate. Rich deep dark flavor that’s sweet and chocolaty with brandy wine tones and oak and dark cocoa. Lingering booze warmth and cocoa and brandy sweetness. \n",

      "I have tried this beer on three different occasions and each time it immediately foams up to the point of aggravation. it is so annoying that i will not endure its fairly good flavor to suffer the indignities of this foaming menace when there are so may other beers that rise to the same flavor level and can actually be drunk within the first ten minutes of pouring it, and forget about trying to drink it straight from a bottle. That is mission impossible>\n",
      "Ap at brewery. Copper pour, sparse head. Malty aroma, raisins. Light sweet taste, more raisins. 3.6% mild light but full\n",
      "Draft at the brewpub.  Yep, it's hazy and yellow.  Boring.  This one is particularly boring ... little aroma, no really descriptive flavors to share here ... no burn (for an \"imperial\") ... clean and without fault, but just flat. \n",
      " Boo.  (#7604, 11/2019)\n",
      "Ok, that was bad. That was just a bad lemonade. At least it was refreshing.\n",
      "Bottle from vintage. Aroma is a little off IPA. Taste, well, what do you expect? Just another rude ass APA that wants to be IPA. There are so many IPA out there, they've taken the place of the cheap american pale lager for the ubiquitous cheap american beer. There must be a brahzillion of them out there. What else can be said?\n",
      "Got as a gift 6-pack. Sour, thin, over-carbonated. Has an “enjoy by” scale but nothing indicated. Committed sacrilege: after three sips I poured the rest out. Maybe I’ll use the others to cook brats.\n",
      "I'm shocked.  This is one of the worst beers I've ever tried.  It tastes like beer with a good dose of jalapeno and onion with beer.  Who thought this would be a good idea???  Mole?? I tasted no mole at all.  Keep the chips and salsa on the side boys not in my drink!\n",
      "Cloudy beer. When poured it is not 355 ml. Approx 330ml in the cans. Taste is ok .\n",
      "Gawno. Pucha wygląda dramatycznie, tandetnie, jakieś napisy w języku suahili Xd, podejrzewam, że podobnie smakują piwa w Afryce. Zapach to słodki spirol, bulion warzywny. Smak nijaki, trochę od siebie odrzucają słodkawe nuty, pewnie jakichś tanich słodów. Pils z zerową goryczką... Nie polecam, shieeet.\n",

      "Pale golden appearance with a white head. Aroma of farmhouse yeast, toasted grain, mild esters, light funk and a light oaky spice. Similar flavor, adding mild sweetness, light acidity and light bitterness. Light to medium body with a slight dry feel and refreshing finish. Good.\n",
      "27/IX/19 - on tap @ Borefts Day 1, BB: n/a - (2019-1597) Thanks to the international RateBeer Crew for sharing today's beers!\n",

      "Clear dark brown beer, small creamy beige head, unstable, non adhesive. Aroma: nice roast, malty, grains, hay, cow fodder, sweet, lots of caramel. MF: ok carbon, medium to light body. Taste: very malty, grains, hay, cow fodder, soft bitterness, soft roast.\n",
      "Color naranja oscuro, turbia, translúcida. Espuma blanca de un dedo de espesor y corta retención. Aroma intenso a fruta de hueso muy madura, melocotón sobre todo, caramelo y ligera miel. Sabor a melocotón, licor, resina y leve pomelo, final medio largo ligeramente dulce y de intenso amargor resinoso y cítrico, alcohol presente aunque no molesto, por lo menos no demasiado. Textura semioleosa. Carbonatación baja.\n",
      "Cask at Hogshead, Wolverhampton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pours almost black with a tight cream head.  Nose has a hint of chocolate, but not much else.  In the mouth it has a creamy texture with coffee and cherries featuring in different areas.  Finish is creamy and slightly bitter.  Extremely drinkable.\n",

      "Pretty cloudy red brown beer, no head. Aroma: sourish, funky, caramel, berries. MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: very sourish start, some vinegar notes, citrus, lemony, quite some wood. Aftertaste: sourish, lots of berries, vinegar, dry, lemony.\n",
      "Draft at the brewery. Pitch black in color. Flavor shows some complexity. Char, earthy green, chocolate, red grapes, prune juice. The body is about normal for a porter. Overall good amount of drink ability.\n",
      "Box @ Golden Lion/Tor Beers, Todmorden.  My last purchase of 2019.  Peach-amber coloured with a slightly dank appearance.  Blueberry is apparent, but its tangy stewed apple is still more dominant.\n",
      "Bottle at Beer Dock, Crewe.  Barrel aged in bourbon barrels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nose is strongly cocoa, plus alcoholic strength.  Pours completely black with a very dark brown transient head.  In the mouth the alcohol is to the  fore, but there is also cocoa, chocolate and hints of chilli.  Finish is boozy with a warming glow !  One for sipping slowly methinks.\n",

      "Clear dark brown to black beer, no head. Aroma: that's a lot of caramel in it, and a lot of coffee... also alcohol is very present, more roasted notes, somewhat nutty. MF: ok carbon, medium body. Taste: sweet start, bit malty, sourish, good roast, some coffee, dark chocolate. Aftertaste: bitter, malty, grains, bit sourish, caramel.\n",
      "Can, from Beer52. Black-brown, thin short lived pale beige head, and low condition. Big sweet nutty almond and chocolate ice cream initially in the nose, with some bitter coconut notes developing. Full and sweet in the mouth to start but quickly turns dry and bitter with some oily off notes. Finish is rough and bitter and a little nutty.\n",
      "14 ounce snifter draft at The Hidden Pig, Haverhill, MA. Flavor shows me grapefruit, mild herbs, malt is mildly sweet. ABV  is lightly noticeable. A tad above average.\n",
      "Cask @ The Pub, Todmorden.  Has this the week before finding the Maple edition and the Manchester Beer Festival and thought this version better in comparison.  Dark creamy-bubbly off-white head and a chocolate heavy nose, with a crisper lesser chocolate roasted taste.\n",
      "12 ounce can from Ernie's in Lexington. An orange pour with floral nose and cinnamon in taste. Different.\n",
      "Keg @ København, Halifax.  Golden in colour with a head.  Simply a pleasantly lightly carbonated fruity brew.\n",
      "Bottle from Belgiuminabox.\n",
      "Pours a hazy golden/amber colour with a huge white throthy head. Aromas of stoney fruits, apricots, peaches, tangerine, tropical fruits, apple pie, bread, jam, a little honey and sugar. Taste has the same but slightly milder notes than the aroma with added grass, spice, orange and lemon zest with a hoppy bitterness on the finish. Fair carbonation on the palate with a medium bodied mouthfeel and a fairly long zesty, hoppy and fruity aftertaste. Really nice\n",

      "Sampled at Big Beers 2020 as \"BART Aged in Bourbon Barrels\". Brow/black appearance with a tan head. Aroma of chocolate malt, caramel, mild honey, light oak/bourbon and hints of dark fruit. Similar flavor, rich and layered with moderate sweetness, a medium to full body and a smooth warming finish.\n",

      "Dark red with a small head. Aroma of sugar, caramel, toffee, dried fruit. Full bodied, sweet, sticky, better than the original.\n",
      "750ml corked and caged bottle. (2018 vintage) Pours an opaque black with a medium, creamy, short lived, tan head that laces. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, dark chocolate, brandy, bourbon, tobacco, vanilla, dried fruit and oak. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, chocolate, tobacco, licorice, candied sugar, molasses, maple, dates, figs, raisins, berries, vanilla, bourbon and oak in a sweet, warming brandy finish. Medium to full body with a creamy, smooth, oily texture and soft carbonation. Wow, a truly beautiful beer. Lots of complexity and dangerously easy to drink. A world class Baltic Porter.\n",
      "Pours black with two finger, dark tan head.  Aroma is vanilla, cocoa, roast and molasses.  Taste is creamy chocolate and brown sugar, moving to vanilla and roast.  Finish is chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla.  Tasty stout.\n",
      "nice. burgundy color. some sweetness. has a nice flavor. another solid beer from these guys.\n",
      "Very malty slightly hoppy aroma. Bronze body, fluffy white head. Nicely balanced flavor, west coast hop aftertaste.\n",

      "Cookie spice aroma. Dark brown, scant head. Actually tastes like what it says.\n",
      "Outstanding sweet ham hock mouthfeel - substantial body to get your tongue ‘around’.  Smooth malt flavor...just enough ‘smoke’ to let you know you’re sipping something special.  Delicious!\n",
      "Really good, but not exceptional. Hoppy and resiny. Light gold with fluffy head  7/4/8/3/17\n",
      "Melon orange color with minimal head. Aroma is bitter hops and some big time sweet malts. Flavors are similar, bitter and sweet, witha significant alcohol presence. I don't think the flavor or aroma is with the big alcohol price tag. I can get as good or better beer for far less alcohol. 6/3/5/3/15\n",
      "Deep red pour. Minimal head. Aroma is boozy and spicy. Flavors reveal a note similar to frosting and certainly some light cinnamon. Good helping of booze and sweetness. A desert sipper for sure. 5/3/5/3/14\n",
      "12 oz. bottle from Root Cellar. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a medium sized fluffy white head. The aroma and flavor have toasted pale malts, earthy and resiny hops, grapefruit citrus, grass, medium bodied, no frills hoppy IPA.\n",
      "Pale golden pour with a thin soapy white head and spots of lacing ... aroma of tropical fruits, pineapple, passion fruit and some citrusy grapefruit .... taste is of tropical pineapple, passion fruit, bitter and tart, pithy with grapefruit, rind and bitter dry hops ... finish is bitter and dry with lingering pith, passion fruit and grapefruit  .... solid and sessionable no trace of abv, easy drinker\n",

      "I mean.. c'mon. The talent it takes to make a beer like this. The cherry presence in this is crazy...really captures the essence of a fresh picked cherry. Then there's the wave upon wave of chocolate fudge, espresso, vanilla, cocoa powder, it all works so well together. Amazing.\n",
      "December 9, 2019 - picked up a bottle while in NYC.  Black pour with deep tan head.  Aroma was nice espresso, chocolate, wood and mild bourbon.  Taste was nicely balanced with the espresso, chocolate, wood and bourbon; not too sweet, not too bitter, not too hot.  Very easy drinking, shouldn't go down this smooth at 12%.  Well done, Founders.\n",
      "Bottle sample at The Draft Room for Berry White Day on 12/7/19. Dark purple pour with sticky legs. Aroma of blueberry, honey and vanilla. Blueberry flavor with honey and vanilla accents before an oaky finish. Seems to be the sweetest of the bunch, although there's not much difference there between the other 3.\n",
      "Bottle sample at The Draft Room for Berry White Day on 12/7/19. Dark purple pour with sticky legs. Aroma of raspberry, honey and slight vanilla. Honey and raspberry flavor giving way to vanilla before a very sweet, yet tart raspberry finish. Milder oaky notes than the other 3 BWs, which made this one my fave of the 4.\n",
      "Growler, picked up at the brewery. Also on tap at the brewery. Pours a viscous, deep mahogany brown. Fine tan head is leggy, viscous, and semi lacing. Nose has fresh ground, fruity coffee bean. Rich chocolate. Chocolate milkshake. Dried berry. Earthy malt. I mean it just smells like a silly good, melted down, high quality chocolate bar with a good espresso on the side. Taste is chocolatey, and fudgy sweet, with light, slightly vinous, earthy coffee bitterness.  Silky mouthfeel. Fine carbonation. Drinks stupid easy. Chocolate and milky coffee bitterness to finish. Unbelievable impy stout, with not a barrel for miles.\n",
      "Clear gold, white head which produces beautiful lasting lacing. Aroma big pine and citrus. Taste grapefruit, mango but beautifully balanced. The epitome of every hoppy west coast IPA I’ve ever tasted, one day I’ll get to drink the younger brother!\n",
      "This beverage can make you feel as happy as waking up on Christmas Day. The sound of childrens laughter washes over you as you crack open that beautiful can of joy. It is the taste of a good session and the pride of a nation. Galahad truly lives up to its namesake at the round table.\n",
      "Sjov og anderledes oplevelse. Smagte ala portvin/ sherry sød, fad, med en masse frugt, rosiner osv.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 6.5%. Small, swiftly-dissipating head. Opaque orange colour. Aroma of sweet malt and smooth rich yellow fruit flesh. Low+ carbonation. Mango and papaya hop flavour hits you straight away, ending on an astringent pine note. Some lovely nuance and developing complexity on these flavours, even into the aftertaste. Thick but silky-smooth mouthfeel, roughness coming from the bitterness not the texture. A very nice sweet biscuit malt, hints of chocolate-chip cookie, but rarely gets a chance to shine through all the hops. Its contributions are splendid, however. Smashing DDH IPA, despite being over a month past the BBE. I've heard Simcoe called the best of hops, and if this beer is anything to go by, it may well be. Cloudwater at their best here.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tout est parfait, elle se voit magnifiquement bien.\n",
      "Cette nouvelle recette est parfaitement équilibrée. Savoureuse en bouche, elle apporte un très léger parfum d'épices, de caramel (mais sans être sucrée), et se boit avec un vrai plaisir. Elle n'est vraiment pas trop forte et, mieux encore, on retrouve ce petit goût métallique (mais agréable) en bouche, caractéristique de la Choue.\n",

      "Keg at We Brought Beer, Balham.  Hazy straw with a white head.  Aroma of wet grass, some over-ripe fruit and that wet dog note.  Flavour is very sweet and caramelly, and I’m getting quite a note of skunked hops on this.  Not sure if that’s deliberately to make the beer sweeter.  However, it seems Wild might be missing the point of NEIPAs and their sweetness.  Flavour is again sweet, before there’s a rush of slightly metallic bitterness, followed by a lingering flavour, not unlike that which you might get after rapidly consuming a whole tube of fruit pastilles.\n",
      "Gravicask, third, shared with Finn at the 22nd Oxford Beer & Cider Festival. No head, hazed golden body, poor lacing. Very modest spiced fruity smell. Flavoured with ginger, paper and cucumber. Prolonged ending. Possible to drink, not my kind of mix. (25.10.2019).\n",

      "Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt, coffee, dark chocolate, lighter coconut and just a hint of an offensive, tart, soapy note that intensifies upon swirling. Taste is dominated by that offensive tart and soapy note that drowns out all of the nicer coffee and chocolate notes in the background. Finishes on a sour note, with some soap lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.\n",

The aroma is fresh and bright, ripe orangey fruits, apricot, peach, zingy tangerine, orange chewits and some sponge cake. The taste is crisp, dry, decent hit of bitterness, cleaned and bright, lovely orangey fruit character, tangerine, apricot, peach, touch of straw and grass with a quenching lay dry finish. Light+ body and decent, yet fine carbonation. Flavourful and effortlessly drinkable. God damn quenching and moreish.\n",

      "From tap at Bierrevier, Basel. Hazy grayish pale golden color with hardly any head. The aroma is full with loads of lime and ginger, lime peel and orange peel. Smells like lemonade. Medium body with a medium acidity, a light tartness and a distinct salinity. The flavor is similar to the smell with an overload of citric notes and ginger, lime juice, citric peel, lemonade and faint notes of acetic acid. Finishes with more lime and ginger, wheat and some lactic notes. Overall with lots of ginger and citric notes and borderline artificial. Lacks a bit of complexity. Not much beer character left.\n",

      "Bottle. Light bronze body with a bright white head. Nose of grapefruit and musk. Hints of caramel. Taste had some orange juice and almonds. There is just a hint of spice in the finish. Nice but a little boring.\n",
      "Pours clear, bright golden with a three finger, white head.  Aroma is caramel and floral hops.  Taste is caramel, moving to hops backbone.  Finish is caramel and hops.\n",
      "May 28, 2019 bottling date.\n",

      "\n",
      "Taken from a 44°F fridge, pour begins after ~5+ min.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aroma is banana, spices, floral, sweet malts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Color is gold, slightly hazy, plenty of rising bubbles to a 1/2 inch white, thick, and creamy-appearing head from a fairly gentle pour, which quickly falls to a 1/4 inch thick creamy cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is spicey backed by the fruit tastes - banana, perhaps other indistinct (apple, maybe), with a solid sweet-ish floral backing. The spiciness is very peppery, and the banana and apple(?) carry throughout.  The floral breadiness adds a lift to the taste that is quite nice. Little alcohol present in the taste, but you can definitely feel it about half way through.  Only a very slight bitterness in the beginning that is pretty much gone by the middle. The finish is sticky and semi-sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium feel, tilting to the thin side, but the primary feel is the carbonation tingling counteracting the creamy smoothness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, dangerously too easy to drink quickly given the ABV; I needed to consciously slow down, because I found it too enjoyable; I just wanted to just sip, sip, and sip again. An excellent tripel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice strong aroma of roasted malts, hints of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly black from the front, dark ruby with a backlight.  Tall, thick, khaki head, creamy, with good retention. As it recedes, the top is cratered and bubbly, leaving good looking thick strings of lacing down the glass. Ample rising bubbles visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is roasted coffee/malts, and as with the aroma, hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Mild bitterness shows up in the middle and carries through to the finish and aftertaste.  The finish is semi-dry with the mild hops bitterness providing excellent balance to the dark malts. This lingers into the aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body has some heft for the style, but objectively medium bodied tending toward the thin side.  The mouth feel is somewhat dry with good carbonation sparkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, an excellent Robust Porter. To my taste, in the same class as the Founders, only slightly better in the strength of the aroma and taste.\n",
      "From a 33 cl bottle.  Pours a clear dark mahogany with an ecru head.  Aromas are of toffee and caramel.  Flavors are moderately sweet caramel malt.  Very nice beer.\n",
      "2019 edition. Dark amber or even coppery beer with nice beige head. Aroma of caramel, some hops (?). Very malty, moderately sweet with a bit bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "Bottle thanks to Drake! Amber pour with a gigantic soft beige head. Dried floral hops, lemon zest, wheat nose. Banana - soft and overripe (but not sweet), wheat, nuttiness, bread. Nice.\n",
      "Tap at Tap 40, Crewe (as 6.3%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bit of a complex case this one.  It calls itself an India Porter, but I would say it’s really a Black IPA.  It pours jet black with a strong but transient beige head.  The nose has coffee to the fore, but plenty of citrus in the background.  The initial taste is sharpness, bitter like lettuce base.  But there is also coffee and chocolate with burnt toast hints.  The finish is bitter black coffee, and alcoholic warmth in the stomach.  Excellent !\n",
      "\n",
      "bottle.  Poured clear dark amber with a big beige head. Typical astringent citrusy IPA aroma. Medium bodied, slick mouthfeel with creamy carbonation. Flavour of roasted grainy malt, with copious bitter herbal hops, notes of citrus and pine.\n",
      "Dark brown with ruby edges. Large dark brown head with high retention. Aroma intensity 4/5. Toast, coffee, butter and metal aroma, notes of earth. Heavy bitter, gentle light sweet. Oily texture. Full body\n",
      "Lots of floral, spicy hops, light lemon or grapefruit, tasty yeast and malts, decent, lingering bitterness.  MF somewhat grainy, nice but for me at least a little bit starchy and soapy too.  Not spectacular but refreshing, elegant and surprinsingly interesting tasting, very good.\n",
      "Аромат конечно карамельный и паточный. Много специй, но приятных, немного корицы и медовой соты. Цвет темно карамельный, пена на удивление есть но тонкая. Вкус немного разочеровал. Начинается все средне плотно, немного паточно, снова специи, ванильное мороженое. При глотке просто очень жесткая горчинка, которая сильно портит все впечатление, и при этом она очень продолжительная и забеирает на себя все вкусовые нотки. Послевкусие немного ореховое, снова нотки карамели но уже за горечью меньше. Очень много лактозы в пиве, и это ощущается. В целом, могло быть намного более топового.\n",
      "Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 19/10/2006.  York did make some darn good cask ales in a good range of styles.  This was a very tasty strong mild.\n",
      "Can from Struise Shop, Bruges. Pours cloudy yellow with a huge, slowly diminishing, frothy, white head. Aroma of dank lychee, pineapple, peach, onion, herbs, pine, grapefruit peel. Taste is sweet juicy peach, pineapple & papaya, some dank onion with a sourish touch, going over bitter pine, spices, kept together by doughy malts. Dry, floral & earthy hoppy finish, lingering yellow fruit, spicy pine, noticeable hop burn. Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Very assertive & tasty NEIPA-like.\n",
      "0,5l bottle (N˚ 011657, BBF: 2028) from Cora in Brussels.\n",
      "F: big, tan, almost good retention.\n",
      "C: coppery, light hazy.\n",
      "A: sweet malty, bit biscuits, marmalade, passion fruits touch, bit citrus, spicy, mellow fruity.\n",
      "T: medium to full body, mellow fruity, bit vinous, spicy, citrus, bit marmalade, bit tropical fruits, almost dry on the palate, soft carbonation, quite nice all together, enjoyed for sure.\n",

      "Very slightly hazy rich golden with a thin foamy white head. Lovely aroma that’s gently sour with notes of sea salt and margarita and black peppercorns and a hint of lime. Crisp bright flavor that’s pale and limey with a little salt and herbal tones And margarita flavors and a touch of mango. Lovely as, with a lingering liner acidity.\n",

      "Bright yellow colour, good sized white head, very fresh with citrus filling, wonderful hops combination, good carbonation with long dry bitter finish.\n",
      "Perhaps my favorite pale ale / IPA out there. Exceptionally well balanced. The best way I can describe this is Heady Topper that is only 6.5% ABV and perhaps a little better balanced.\n",
      "Pours a solid black \"stout\" color into a glass, and eventually leaves a moderate lacing. There is only a feint smell of chocolate and coffee, but no shortage of taste. Initially a sweeter milk flavor with a bitter malty coffee and chocolate finish. More bitter than one would normally expect from a milk stout, but still very good nonetheless. Overall a very solid stout and very flavorful for a mere 4.9% ABV. Pairs well with cheese and crackers.\n",
      "Superb strong ale on draught at The Golden Bowler, Stubbington, Near Fareham.\n",
      "Opaque black beer with a medium dark brown head. Heavy aroma; taste starts medium/heavy sweet and ends slightly/medium bitter and dry. Chocolate, mocha, roasted malts and coffee. 8/5/9/5\n",
      "Smooth and refreshing on a hot summer day after yard work. A very even beer. Got it in the throwback cans from “Jaws”. Hey if Quint drinks it then it must be good. Cheers.\n",
      "Coffee on the nose. Black and dense tan pour. Evocative mix of flavours - all those beans are there! Chocolate blends with coffee but the vanilla also maintains its presence among more potent colleagues. Definite bitterness from roasted malts and a vanilla based long finish.\n",
      "375ml bottle @ Josh's. Thanks Charles. Pours an opaque dark brown with a small brown head. Nose is rich barrel notes, light molasses, dark chocolate, and trace bourbon notes. Flavour is intensely complex, great mix of bourbon, with molasses, cocoa, some dark fruits that gives it a cake a like character. Full bodied, soft carbonation, and a moderately high sweetness with and very smooth. That's delicious\n",
      "Again good one from Stone. Really like the cans but this one too. Good one also.\n",
      "One of the best can on the market so far. Really enjoy this one. Great ratings.\n",

      "500ml bottle in 2015. Clear copper with a thin offwhite head. Clear force carbonation. Aroma of plastic, malt extract and some grassy hops. Flavour is very fake and has that weird plastic, mineral note that most GK bottled beers have. Unpleasant.\n",
      "330ml bottle in 2015. Clear Amber, with a tiny white head. Aroma of Malt, boiled sweets, and fake orange. Aggressive CO2 (which is listed as an ingredient - honest, I suppose). Barley sugar flavour, with some menthol, and stewed tea notes. Finish was bitter Resin, peal and biscuity malt.\n",
      "Perfectly clear golden coloured body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall pure white head Aroma of nasty, super funky corn, sugar, millet and off-grains with a light yeat bite, some yeast and bready notes, but a non-existing and slightly nasty funk noticeable immediately when the nose is put up to the glass. Light-bodied; Strong funky corn and fake-malt notes with a lot of bread, yeast, fake sugar and stale funk noticeable throughout, with nothing enjoyable to catch and hold onto - this is purely off-putting flavours with a dash of yeast and bready qualities with some earthy and nut finishes that give it at least something else than the fake flavours. Aftertaste is dry, herbal and very funky throughout with a lot of nutty and earthy flavours, but the fake sugars and especially fake malts dominate in a bad and unsettling way. Overall, a very poor 'beer', but I suppose if you pretend to have some issues with handling glutens, this would be some alcohol; however, if you are in that category and pretend that you can't handle them, then just settle for something non-beer, please. I sampled this sixteen ounce, pint-sized can, purchased fby my wife by accident, after running a marathon (USMC Marathon 2019) at home in Washington on 27-October-2019 for US$2,99 at Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia a few hours earlier, sampled at home in Washington on 06-November-2019 after forcing myself to get rid of this crap.\n",
      "Can to mug. Pours piss yellow, forced carbonation. Somewhat off cereal on the nose, metallic. Has a funny buttery flavor more than anything else. Goes down smooth. Possibly the cheapest beer in my market. 43 cents later, I'm refreshed and a little buzzed. Mission accomplished.\n",
      "12 ounce with no bottling date. Mostly clear, orange-copper pour with a lasting disc of spongy foam. Nose is rubber with maybe a hint of toast. Flavor starts out the same and improves slightly to charred popcorn and resin. Decent balance, near-medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation are the nicest things I can say about this beer. Bathtub pour; hoping it will help unclog any hair balls.\n",

      "\"Sophienhofer Pils\", 1-l-Flasche aus dem \"Erlebnis Braugasthof\" Brauner Hirsch, 3 Tage nach Erwerb konsumiert. - Goldbraun, leicht trüb. - In der Nase karamelliges helles Malz, vor allem aber aufdringliche ranzige Noten (Hefe?). - Auch im Geschmack dominiert eine scharfe hefig-ranzige Bittere, welche die auch vorhandene karamellig-füllige Malzigkeit und die grasige Hopfenherbe brutal unterdrückt und keine Freude aufkommen läßt. Milder rezent, vollmundig. Im Abgang kühlende Minze vor beträchtlicher grasig-hopfenwürziger Herbe. Übel ranziger Nachtrunk. - Was ein durchaus trinkbares Landbier (allerdings definitiv kein Pils, dafür ist es zu plump) sein könnte, wird durch derbe ranzige Hefebittere völlig ruiniert. Nein, so geht es nicht, liebe Sophienhofer Brauer. Wenn Euer Bier schneller umkippt als der Kunde es nach Hause tragen kann, habt Ihr ein Hygieneproblem. (6.11.2019.)\n",

      "3.0%. På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Svart. Mokkafarget filmskum. Aroma av mørk sjokolade. Smaken lett. Litt lakris. Tørr avslutning. Kakao.\n",
      "33cl can from Geers. Brewed in Berlin. Doesn't taste too German so I figure the hops and recipe made it across the atlantic. Pours golden to light copper, very frothy creamy head. Nose is green hops, resin. Not too tropical. Excellent bitter balance for this ABV. MF is refreshing, finish is short to medium, with a balanced fading bitterness. A true summer session pale ale.\n",
      "Vi er benket langs bordet og selvsagt topp motiverte for nok en kveld med inntak av primærprofylakse, rundhåndet distribuert av seremonimester Melberg, feb-20. Kveldens første er en lettøl, som med sin elegante fruktige letthet (tropiske frukter, søt citrus og et streifav furunål) imponerer samtlige deltakere. Fra fat, og utseendet er upåklagelig.\n",
      "The bottle I have states 5,9% ABV, not 5,5% as for the other ESB, so I post my rating here.\n",

      "Amber and clear with a thin head.\n",
      "Smell of roasted malts. Bitter at the attack, later the malty component develops. Weak bodied and low carbonation.\n",
      "A bit too harsh on the bitterness. Astringent. Cask served from The Wellington in Birmingham.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Gylden. Filmskum. Aroma av krydder & tropisk frukt. Smaken det samme. Lett tørr avslutning.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Gylden. Luftig filmskum. Ferskenaroma. Myk munnfølelse. Smaken ananas. Tørr sitruspreget avslutning.\n",
      "Can, 0.473l. Aroma of raspberry, passion fruit, white wine, tannins and yeast. Pours hazy pinky orange color with totally diminishing off-white head and average sparkling appearance. Taste starts light sweet and sour grainy and citrusy, follows by tart passion fruit, peach, berries and tannins with smooth and rather dry mouthfeel. Light to medium body, slick texture and average carbonation in palate. Refreshing arts...\n",
      "On cask, real ale, very neutral but clean with the body rounding out the overall impression. Wellington birmingham\n",
      "Flaska från Systembolaget. Halmgul vätska. Brödig, med drag åt sötbrödhållet, doft. Tunn och vattnig med en lätt maltsötma som nödtorftigt matchas av en svag beska. Inget kul öl.\n",
      "440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Gylden. 0 skum. Lett grapefruktaroma. Smaken søtgrapefrukt. Tørr bitter avslutning.\n",

      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Gylden. 0 skum. Aroma av overmoden sitrusfrukt. Smaken tørket tropisk frukt. Tørr avslutning.\n",
      "Bottle from Erzengel. Cheers. Grassy aroma with a floral streak and underlying yeasty sour element. Light gold. Thick foamy head. Light bitter. Some tangy sourness but overall it's rather herby. Light bodied but slick. Soft-fizzy carbonation. Long dry astringent finish.\n",

Small patches of lace. Aroma of bourbon, malt, fruit and hops. Full-bodied with flavors of oaky bourbon, caramel malt, vanilla and mild earthy hop. The finish is oaky with a bourbon and malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.\n",

      "Can picked up from Liebick Getränkemarkt, Germering and consumed at home Attenkirchen, Wednesday 5th February 2020, cooking Spaghetti Bolognese and listening to Steve Lamaq on 6Music. A superb stout ok it's a little hoppy and some might suggest it blurs the line between Stout and Black IPA, roastiness and with a really good softness. A touch of burnt toast, dry finish.

      "Oh my lord. Got this as a gift from my sister from Billie's Bier Festival in Antwerp. This is one of the best imperial stouts I've tasted. The flavour is smooth and complex. You don't notice the 14° alcohol percentage at all. Great for people who love sweet tasting stouts. One of my favourites for sure!\n",

Flavor is bold tropical fruits (orange, tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit) with lactose sweetness.  This is an easy drinker with the 8.5% well-hidden.  A great example of a NEIPA!\n",

      "Awesome beer, dark, complex, boozy af. Only reason I didn't rate more highly is because I tried the 2017 and that was even better\n",
      "Gose in the new Cascade house style, 37.5 cl bottle shared by Meeki Meekio, thanks Marc!  Eggshell-white; mousy, medium thick, stable head over a hazy ochre-tinged apricot blonde beer.  Aroma of dried wakame, old coriander seed, sourdough, sour apples, old dry lemon peel, some lime zest, bread crust.  Crisp, sour onset, lemony, sour apples but also a subtle sweetish pineapple accent, minerally carbonation, drying lactic tartness throughout accompanied by a light seaweed saltiness – but remaining very light, much lighter in fact than in most modern Goses (and probably closer to the salty level of historical Gose).  Some chicken broth-like ‘meatiness’ in the end, over a wheaty-bready, slick maltiness, spiced by a dash of old coriander seed.  Pretty nice, seemingly a bit more complex than the average modern Gose, but at the same time more restrained and less salty as well.  Interesting one, quite different from the classic (75 cl) Cascade sours I am used to from the ‘old’ days…\n",

      "One of the ‘groundbreaking collaborations’ (their own words) Stone Berlin – no longer in existence – has done, in this case with Mahr’s Bräu in Bamberg and legendary Avery in the U.S.; from an impressive magnum bottle shared by Filip Van Damme at Nieuwjaarsreceptie Gentse Biervereniging, cheers!  Medium thick, mousy, pale greyish off-white head lacing in shreds over a clear, copper-hued burgundy red-brown beer.  Aroma of cooked sausages, fried horse steak, dusty old wood, hard caramel, walnut purée, dried figs, marzipan, wet toast, mushrooms pan-fried with brown sugar, brandy.  Sweet onset with impressions of dried fig and date as well as some apple peel and blue plum; medium carb, full oily and bit vinous mouthfeel.  Caramelly malt core with a soft brown-bready edge as well as an upcoming smoky note, reminiscent of smoked sausages and even (vaguely) bonfire, plunging into a long, warming, complex finish coloured by a late peppery hop bitter touch, lingering malt sweetness and smokiness as well as brandy-like alcohol.  Nice, full, complex ‘Rauchbock’ – Aecht Schlenkerla’s example amplified with American craft brewing boldness.  Different and alluring, one of the most interesting and satisfying beers of the whole evening for me.\n",
      "Dark sour ale – essentially a broadening of the Flemish ‘oud bruin’ category – by this classic craft brewery in Minneapolis, aged in red wine barrels, thanks to tderoeck for sharing.  Some loose, off-white bubbles around the edge, but quickly gone into complete ‘headlessness’; hazy dark mahogany brown robe.  Aroma of passionfruit, dry sherry, sour plums, candi sugar, fig jam, pech, brown rum, wood glue, old red wine, brambleberries, brandy.  Fruity, estery onset, sour with a sweetish core, impressions of blackberry, fig and sour plums, soft carb, strong lactic sourness drying the palate, over a caramelly, softly bready malt backbone; woody tannins add further dryness in the finish, with a strong and evidently unsurprising impression of dry and tannic red wine (‘gecorseerd’ as we say in Dutch), quite complex, woody, fruity long and warming.  Maintains relatively high drinkability whilst adding considerable complexity, like the best Flemish ‘oud bruin’ beers; among the best American interpretations of this style I had so far.  Experienced and acclaimed Surly never disappoints, it seems.\n",
      "500ml bottle. Pours clear golden with a nice white head. Aroma of grass, white bread, light citrus, hint of spices. Taste of bread, grass, biscuit, citrus, slightly floral. Sweet arrival with a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium body. It won't blow your mind but it isn't meant to. Perfect for what it is - a well made, refreshing pale ale.\n",

W aromacie nuty słodowe, kukurydziane sodu pilzneńskiego, siana, truskawkowe estrowe, na początku też lekka ścierka, która potem się ulatnia. W smaku lekko wodniste, pustawe, półwytrawne, słód, kukurydza, siano. Pełnia niska, wysycenie średnie do średnio wysokiego, goryczka bardzo niska. Niezbyt dobry, wodnisty helles o niezbyt czystym profilu zaburzonym estrowością. Do zapomnienia.\n",

      "0,44 boks fra statens helsekostutsalg i Verksagta, hjemme  mens jeg lager middag: en fantastisk liflig duft slår mot nesegrevet i det jeg heller en uklar korngul, fint skummende væske oppi mitt GBGF-glass. En NEIPA-aroma som bare sier \"drikk meg, drikk meg\". Saftige, tropiske frukter, lke safti søt citrus, ganskudd og en solid maltkropp. Hva mer trenger man på en fredagskveld? Ikke så mye mer.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy dark amber color, thick beige head. Intense clove, spice and banana aroma. Medium to dry taste, medium to low bitterness. Clove spicey, banana fruity aftertaste. High carbonation, full body. \n",
      "This is just the perfect Weizen for me, I love it.\n",
      "From can thanks to Gene (Travlr). Light unclear golden color with white head. Hoppy and light malty aroma, pine, grass, dank grassy, citrus. Sweet and moderate bitter taste. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Beers of Europe and drunk on 06/09/2006.  A very smooth, quite roasty stout, with hints of sweetness, but primarily coffee and roasted malt flavours.\n",

      "500ml bottle from Beers of Europe, and drunk on 01/09/2006.  Always liked this one.  Just a very solid, well balanced Porter.  Only mild complaint was that it was a tad overcarbonated.\n",
      "A bit blunt, to the point, but good all the same. Like the look your boss gives you when you show up to work noticeably hungover, yet still do a good job\n",
      "On tap at Archive. Pours slightly hazy gold w/thin white head, light citrus aroma. Easy drinking and well balanced w/rounded bitterness throughout, a bit of a spicy palate to finish.\n",
      "Pours clear bright golden with a three finger, white head.  Aroma is strong hops and lacto.  Taste is thin caramel, moving to lacto and hops.  Finish is strong hops. A hoppy \"gose.\"\n",
      "Как и ожидалось аромат очень копченый, но не концентрированный, много дымки а также намеки на хлеб и карамель. Пенка средняя а вот цвет темно янтарный и глубокий, манящий конечно но. Вкус на удивление весьма питкий, дикие 8 градусов не ощущаются от слова вообще. От дуппель бока нету тоже почти не следа, только легкая карамельная нотка которая полностью поглощена солодом и копченостью. Хотя при глотке она тоже не особо сильная и приятная, и даже не напоминает рыбу. Наверно и есть намеки на хлеб но тоже под нежныи слоем копчености. В целом один из лучших копченых пивасов что пробовал.\n",
      "Pours hazy amber with one finger, white head.  Aroma is citrus, lacto and tequila.  Taste is grapefruit, moving to tart lime and wheat.  Finish is grapefruit, lime and tequila.  Good sour.\n",

      "Da berne a secchi\n",

      "\n",
      "Lime is fair and vibrant to the drink. Salt is light and felt upon the mouthfeel. Pilsner malt brightens the complexion followed by a Vienna malt finish. As the beer warms, corn is distinguished with the malt composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buenaveza is a sumptuous Mexican lager. This craft beer comes across as a plain Mexican beer, but this is an upgrade over a Modelo Especial or Tecate. It reminds me of making salsa, which I drink as I sample each batch I make. I enjoyed this brew and would gladly buy 24 packs of it. What I really want to do next is to make a Michelada with Buenaveza to see how it comes out. \n",

      "750 mL bottle from Total Wine (North Hills-Raleigh, NC).  Bottled September 1, 2015.  Dark orange pour with a frothy off-white head.  Aroma of apple cider and light oak.  Taste is incredible with green apple and lemon peel dominating any and all other flavors.  The finish is certainly tart but not too heavy on the palate.  A really nice surprise!\n",

      "750 ml bottle from Tavour, 11/24/19.  Pours a thick, dark brown-black color with a nice sheeting froth of dark brown head atop it.  Leaves plenty of brown lacing on the glass as you sip this deliciously sweet beverage.  Aroma of rich chocolate and cinnamon.  Some light roast as well.  Drinks sweet, like a beautiful cinnamon hot chocolate with some marshmallows floating in it.  Just enough roast to keep it from being a full on sugar bomb, but still this is damn sweet.  The mouthfeel is silk.  Just completely smooth, creamy, and a little rich.  Finishes slightly sticky, which totally works here.  It should honestly be illegal to hide 13.5% this well.  How often is a 13.5% beer burn free and easy drinking?  Good lord, this is dessert beer at it's best.  Skip the hot chocolate, and instead pour this into a snifter, pull up by the fireplace, and enjoy!  This is the best things I've had in the sweet stout game in quite some time.  Doesn't happen to me often these days, but I am just blown away.  \n",

      "The aroma is malt but way too soft, has good foam on a soft caramelly body. Flavour is vague malt and grain of no distinction. The mouthfeel is weak and messy. It's all awkward, and there's no way this could be considered a bitter.\n",
      "When the lid was cracked, I almost barfed immediately. This has to be the worst smelling product that I've ever entered into RateBeer and that includes some pretty awful beers. If you have been to SouthEast Asia and you know the smell immediately when you enter a room (shop) that there is a cut up, WARM, durian lobe somwhere...this is that smell, somehow multiplied. Raw onions, rotting meat, funk, odd fruits and a spoiled pineapple on top of that mix - absolutely disgusting, and if I could give a negative aroma score, I absolutely would. The colour is pink, slightly violet and showing a faint off-white head that fades fast. Light-bodied; Strong fruit flavours show first with the stronger, meatier funk right behind with some durian notes, onion flavours and a dash of apples under those way more pungent notes. Aftertaste shows the funk and pungent meaty/umami notes that aren't good - just pure bad and nasty. Overall, if you can make it past the smell, the flavour is slightly better, but still insanely pungent and strong, in all the wrong ways. I absolutely love Graft ciders, but this was easily the worst drink I've had in a very long time, perhaps many years. I found it a challenge to make it through, and I did so almost as a joke, but I did NOT pour this out, that said, it was horrible to  make it through. I sampled this twelve ounce can, purchased from Liqour Outlet in Boonton, New Jersey on 23-June-2019 for US$3,69 sampled in my hotel room in Richmond, Virginia on 25-October-2019.\n",

      "Yes, can. Unlike the cask that I tried 4 years ago which I remember extremely well. (Actually I have no idea). This pours with a bleach white foam and medium gold body, with nothing but rotting grain on the nose.  The flavour is soft Hallowe'en candies, those chewy caramel types, and a fair bit of tin thrown in. Cloying sugariness. Wow, just.... I can't even, as the reddit incel moderators say. Just a pile of caramelly junk.\n",

      "J'avais une certaine appréhension en decapsulant cette Westmalle double tant la triple est pour moi un graal absolu et tant le style des doubles est un style compliqué. J'aurais donc mis un temps certain avant de franchir le pas. Et oui, donc le style n'est pas évident pour aboutir à des bières exceptionnelles, mais cette Westmalle double est très agréable, sous couvert d'un excellent équilibre et pêche finalement d'un manque de pep's et de caractère que l'on retrouve sur la triple. Quelque peu douceâtre, cette double a du mal nous amener vers des envolées lyriques. On u retrouve cependant tout le savoir-faire des bières trappistes. Belle prestation en verre avec un brun soutenu et une mousse brune crémeuse et généreuse. Le nez est doux, sur le chocolat, la noisette, le caramel, la banane avec heureusement quelques épices (coriandre et girofle) qui viennent réveiller le tout. L'attaque présente une fraiche amertume sur une base douce reprenant le cocktail découvert au nez. Mes arômes y sont cependant pleins. La deuxième bouche est dans la lignée avec un alcool à 7% d'une bonne efficacité, même si un 8% pourrait ne pas faire de mal pour donner un peu plus de pep's. L’arrière-bouche, sur une amertume fraîche est un brin astringent. Belle corpulence, doublée d'une bonne longueur avec un final tout en douceur. Un manque d'envolée lyrique qui nous empêche une parfaite élévation spirituelle, mais une double bien faîte et agréable.\n",

      "Clear amber with some bubbles rising but it's lighter than expected. The head is fluffy & white, holding very well with good lacing too. The smell was a fresh & hoppy one with floral notes & a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus & grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine & subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated & medium with a clean feel & the alcohol content is hidden well too. Very nice & easy to drink; not the best DIPA I've had but it is certainly up there.\n",
      "Taster at Bittercreek. Black pour, collar of tan head. Aroma hints at dark malts and coffee. Taste focuses a bit more on the coffee, while very light, and a bit of cola. Schwarzbier? Could be...\n",
      "50cl bottle at Bar Pizzeria Bigno, Rimini, Italy. Pours hazy loaded gold, with abundant white foam, very fine. Aroma is pretty intense of banana, also grainy. Body is average, with good carbonation. Taste is medium sweet, not excessive. Final is average in length.\n",
      "Shared 12 oz. barrel poured to a small snifter showing a black/brown hue, with a presentable layer of tan froth, and foamy spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was roasted, malty, caramel/brown sugar & toffee  sweetness, dark fruit, some barrel hints, and vanilla. Medium+ bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar, remaining rather sweet, adding touches of treacle & soy, roasted bitterness, pronounced, bourbony booze, but not all of 16%, imo.\n",
      "W aromacie mocno chmielowe, pachnie bardziej jak bipa niż stout. Barwa czarna piana piękna. W smaku smukłe, lekko do średniej paloność, tutaj chmielu tak nie czuć. Półwytrawne, kawowe. Przyjemne.\n",
      "Pours black, no head. Rich chocolatey coffee nose, nore chocolate than coffee, hints of mint.  Smooth, surprisingly light, definite milk notes. Almost cola sensation later.\n",
      "Bottle thanks to SimonTomlinson. Hazy golden appearance. Aroma is lemon, grassy, tropical, pineapple and fruity. Flavour is wheat, banana, grassy and malt.\n",
      "An amazingly good beer. I am so happy I tried this one. Very promising. Well chosen, the 6 hops. Wow!!!\n",
      "2018 bottle. Pours a clear ruby-bronze color with a medium off-white head that diminishes steadily to an outer ring. Partial rings of lace. Aroma of tart fruit, oak, yeast and malt. Medium body with flavors of tart raspberry, oak, funky yeast, cherry and biscuit malt. The finish is oaky and tart with a berry and cherry aftertaste. Good beer all around.\n",
      "500ml bottle from Waitrose, Berkhamsted and drunk on 12/06/2006.  Quite a nice bitter, with nothing particularly special about.  Just solid.\n",
      "Can from Honest Brew. Cloudy pale straw colour with a white head. No lacing. Lively carbonation. Aroma: Citrus peel, grapefruit juice, grassy hops and bread. Taste: Bitter hops, citrus and a molty sweetness in the background. Crisp and easy drinking beer\n",

      "Schwarzes Stout im Glas mit hellbraunem Schaum. In der Nase Kaffee und Röstmalzsirup. Im Mund stark schokoladig, Kaffeesäure, deutlich malzig, ausgewogen, erst im Angang süßlich, Zuckerrübensirup.\n",
      "500ml bottle, 2016 vintage. Caramel malt aroma with notes of dark fruit, toffee, red wine, oak, vanilla, earthy rye, bourbon and a hint of booze. Pours cloudy toffee colored with a thin tan head that has little retention and no lacing. Starts with rich caramel, toffee, dark fruit and earthy rye flavors as well as having a rich, full body and smooth mouthfeel. Finishes incredibly smooth with vanilla, red wine, oak, bourbon and a little bit of warming booze that’s like a hug on the inside. Wonderful barleywine!\n",
      "12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Familiar aromas of chocolate, coffee, wet hay and woodland, with a little bit of sweet vanilla blended in there. Pours a deep chocolate motor oil brown with two fingers of creamy tan head and good effervescence on the glass. It's a Guinness without a doubt. Really well balanced as you'd come to expect. Not really a big transition in flavors from start to finish. Roast and plum notes are a little more pronounced right on the point of the mid-palate. Nice mild roast with just a touch of sweetness, a bit like cafe au lait. Very easy to drink. Satisfying. Great. Just a little bit sticky. Well done. Keep it up fellas, these new brews you've been doing have all been fantastic. Slainte!\n",
      "Normally not an IPA guy but this beer totally changed my opinion!! After I took a sip of this beer I knew it was 100% time to slay with my IPA. This is absolutely perfect if you like your beer like you like your women; blonde.\n",

      "Bottle, 750 ml from Aroogant Sour Festival. Shared with Miro B and Max. Milky red, small white head. Nice funk in aroma, berries, cherries, berries, medium sourness, barnyard. Nice fruity saison with classical SARA profile. Very nice.\n",

      "Glass at the Portal, pours a pinkish orange with medium head. Nose and flavor are cherry candy, salty minerals, Pinot, vitamins, Sara’s juice hole, and inner sprees. This is ridiculously good and preferred to Amongst friends.\n",

      "Tasted at 2019 Prop day. Pours black with beige head. Thick and chewy. Super mellow with the aging. You get just a little rye spice with cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel. Goes down very easy.\n",
      "Tasted at Prop Day. Pours black with dark beige head. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, spices. Nice thick mouthfeel. You get a ton of coffee with a hint of orange and cinnamon. Cocoa, vanilla, caramel and molasses. Excellent new variant. Kind of a combo of last years orange and the famous coffee BCS.\n",
      "Tasted at Prop day. Pours black with beige head. Aroma and taste of cocoa, molasses, caramel and coffee. Thick and chewy. Great mouthfeel. Would like to try them head to head but I think I like the last 2 reserve years a little better. Still very well done.\n",

      "Thin head, no lacing, little aroma, sort of plain. Malty Marzen flavor, but not a whole lot to be remembered.\n",
      "Pale yellow color, sour lager aroma. Not detecting anything Oktoberfesty about this, just a common sour lager.\n",
      "Delt med Rune. Appelsinfarget. Uklar. Filmskum. Juiceaktig. Aroma av frokostjuice. Smaken grønnsaker & krydder. Ikke vellykket.\n",
      "Soft banana aroma, has murky orange body with little foam. Flavour is this awful cloying bitter citrus. The banana is way down there, nothing is balanced. Then there's this bad bitter aftertaste, like they took the whole orange skin and thought making that the primary flavour was a good thing. I sure hope this is infected and not intentionally like this.\n",
      "Has a weak clear yellow body with no foam, smells of soft nothingness, maybe vague sweetness. Flavour is weak lager and maybe sweet green tea but I'd challenge anyone to notice it without being told it's there. Mouthfeel is full anyway. It's a letdown, just a weak lager, no balance.\n",
      "Keg at BrewDog Outpost Tower Hill.  Dark brown with no head.  Aroma of roasted nuts, chocolate and popcorn... kind of like I remember cinema lobbies smelling of.  Very thin body, probably to be expected.  A bit too sweet too.\n",
      "Cask conditioned at the Steel City Beer Festival '19, Kelham Island Museum, Sheffield. Hazy gold with white head. Well I'm really not sure if this beer was meant to be like this, I could hardly believe it could be but it was vinegar, vomit, sicky in character, thin. Pretty bad.\n",

      "Cask at GBBF Winter 2020, red-brown and lightly hazy, a fine crema and a sweetish nose with a winey hint. Sweet with an oddly astringent finish.\n",
      "Aroma : Roasted chocolate malt, light coconut touch and a hint of burnt wood.  Taste : Coconut is not especially evident in the taste; it gets lost in the lovely roasted chocolate malt. Nice bitter sweet balance; a decent porter (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep red, a touch of fruit and sweet coffee on the nose. Sweet and burnt, a bit cloying.\n",
      "750-ml bottle from mousetrap. gushed but expectedly so didn't lose much, good smooth-on-top beautiful-from-the-side loudly fizzy head, arcs of lace, beautiful hazy reddish syrup color, wild malty nose, full body, berry, yogurt, tart, perfectly balanced, bready finish. rating #1!\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours black with a small light brown head. Aroma reveals hearty oats upfront, with gentle roast and a nice earthiness. Flavour is very hearty, with lots of hearty oats, a touch of coffee, and medium roast. Rounded and deep, with good drinkability. How I want my oatmeal stout to be. What the hell are you on about, Dean? Very good.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy dull blonde with a small whit shear. Aroma reveals lots of coriander, gentle salt, and citric notes. Flavour reveals plenty of coriander and yogurty lacto upfront, with plenty of citrus and moderate salt. Quite citric and spicy on the finish. Decently made.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy dark red with a small beige head. Aroma is full of jammy berries, moderate pith, and some lacto. Flavour is very fruity, with mixed red berries, lots of lacto, and a hint of sweetness. Quite pithy and tart. Fun beer, but not very complex.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear copper golden with a small beige head. Aroma brings out bitter piney hops and crisp biscuity malt, in west good coast fashion. Flavour is quite bitter, with plenty of bright, biting piney hops, a little grass, and crisp biscuity malt. Nice to image a proper west coast IPA amidst all the hazy these days. Piney and crisp. Nothing mind-blowing, just very well-made.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear pale golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out a very peppery spiced character with little else discernible. Flavour is along the same lines, with grassy notes, a herbal character, and crisp biscuity malt. Herbal and spicy. It’s alright.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy dull golden with a small white head. Aroma is full of lacto upfront, with everything else taking a backseat - there’s some floral hops in there, but they’re drowned out by the yogurt. Flavour is more balanced between the lacto and hops, with harsh floral hops and lots of yogurt. Not overly well-integrated, but it’s a fun one.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy bronze with a small white head. Aroma reveals earthy coffee upfront, with little of the base beer discernible. Flavour is along the same lines, with earthy coffee and a bready malt base. The coffee is nice, albeit very simple. Okay beer.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a clear copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out sweet candied sugar and estery notes. Flavour is estery and sweet, with a pretty chaotic profile of cotton candy, booze, and out-of-control esters. Not properly brewed. Difficult to drink.\n",
      "On tap in the brewpub as \"Canary Cross Amber\". Aroma : light caramel & cereal malts, hint of indistinct red fruit hop.  Taste : Specific flavours don't really come through, but has a light sweet malt feel nicely balanced by a light bittering, not horrible just a tad boring (Florida tour Nov 2018)\n",

Flavour is quite dank and vibrant, with lots of citrus hops, earthy notes, dankness, and crisp dry biscuity malt. Dank, dry and vibrant. Very good.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is rather dusty, with earthy hops, sawdust, and cereal malt. Flavour is less vibrant than hoped for a mosaic IPA, with earthy hops, bready malt, and some gentle tropical fruits. Again, not as bright as hoped for. Decent but could be better dialled in.\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a hazy golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out an earthy hop character, with some onion, and some juicy fruit pith. Flavour is more or less the same, with herbal and piney hops, earthy notes, and onion. Not as vibrant as the Sabro I just had, but the clarity is solid. Good stuff\n",
      "On tap at 33 Exp, pours a cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out fresh piney hops, some resins, and tropical pithy fruits. Flavour has great clarity, with bright tropical fruits, lots of pithy hops, and some sticky resins. So juicy and with great clarity. Excellent.\n",

      "Bottled, 330ml from the Thornbridge Brewery Shop, Bakewell, Derbys. Gold to amber with white head. This has quite an assertive resinous bitterness from the off, hoppy, sharp in character. Dry grapefruit flavours, lemon rind, grass, pine needles. Very pleasant.\n",

      "Can from Joe’s enjoyed after returning from Flint.  Pours a light gold color with a white head. Big aroma of lemony citrus plus sweetness. The flavor is almost like pineapple juice with light pithy bitterness. Kind of an overall brut streak too. Okay.\n",
      "Tap at Belmont Station. Colour..ruby red with no head. Nose...essence of cherry compote,  kirschwasser and vanilla cream with hints of maraschino juice. Palate...a quick assault of tart cherry tang and then waves of sweet cherry purée dance across the palate. The gleek fest begins at the mid palate and is highly pronounced at the back with plenty of acetic goodness. The finish is laced with vanilla notes and is also long, tart and bittersweet.\n",
      "Poured from a 16 oz can dated January 28, 2020. \n",
      "Aroma is very hop forward and fruity with lots of mango, passion fruit, mango, lychee and some over ripe fruit. Light dank, resin notes. Light cracker malt notes and a hint of alcohol. \n",

      "Hazy plum pour, relatively abundant head. Marvelous blueberry aroma, some funk, some wood. Bracingly tart at first, but the palate acclimates. Full-bodied. Lots of blueberry character. Almost sweet after a while. Modest but notable wine. A dark chocolate pairing is not bad. Good beer.\n",

      "Draught at a burger/craft beer joint in Singapore. Blueberries, blackberries, cherries, lots of chocolate, coffee, licorice, subtle tobacco. Smooth and creamy, high drinkability despite its ABV, earthy coffee finish. Quite dry, which is really nice in this era of pastry stout overflow. Superb!\n",
      "Draught at Absurdalna, somewhere between 2017 and 2018. Dark chocolate, redcurrant, vinous notes, raspberries, coffee, pumpernikel, subtle vanilla, thick, oily and smooth beer. More fruity aroma and more malty flavour. Sweet-bitter, balanced, alcohol hidden. Its reputation is justified.\n",
      "Can from a friend thanks for the opportunity! \n",
      "Hazy electric lemon in color with a decent sized bubbly white head that shows moderate retention. Tangerine pineapple grapefruit mango just dripping with citrus. Light bready maltiness provides a backbone for the hops. Outstanding beer.\n",
      "Canned, from glasbanken.se.  Cloudy golden, firm mid sized head. Aroma of lime and tangerine. Mid sweet with medium body and clean, rounded mouthfeel. Mostly key lime, some grapefruit. The 65 IBU are well hidden. A luxurious version of Grape Tonic with added lime. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured clear dark brown color with an average frothy tan head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy barrel aged, oatmeal and raisins aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy dark dark rich sweet flavor with a moderate to heavy dark boozy sweet finish of medium to long duration. This is a standout beer met my expectations.\n",

      "Bottle from Beers Of Europe.\n",
      "Pours a clear dark mahogany/ruby colour with a thinnish beige head. Fairly lively carbonation in the glass. Aromas of roasted malts, dry dark fruits, fruit cake, caramel, treacle, syrup, cherries, berries, tobacco, leather, roasted bread and a little sugar. Taste has all the notes as the aroma. Slightly sweet but not overly so. Full bodied with a lovely smooth oily chewy mouthfeel. Much lower carbonation on the palate. Nice malty lip smacking aftertaste. Easy drinking for 7.1%, alcohol is well hidden. Very nice.\n",
      "On draft. Light golden color,  with a white head. Clean dry malt, cracker, melon, grass, notes of citrus, and some dank hops. Tasty and easy drinking. Definitely not a traditional pilsner.\n",
      "Łohoho, ależ to dłuugie ma usta, wypijesz łyk, zaśniesz i rano jeszcze czujesz smak. Gęste, genialna wanilia z beczki, aromat nie jest taki obiecujący, trochę alkoholowy, ale podniebienie wynagradza wszystko. Piwo do sączenia godzinami. Umiar wskazany.\n",

      "Amber clear with a one finger wide head.\n",
      "Smell of roasted malts with a caramel note and a hoppy background. In taste a roasted malty side melts with a strong bitter one, rich and smooth body. Low carbonation and a nutty, bitter aftertaste.\n",
      "A fine beer.\n",
      "Which is easy to drink weiss beer, but also very clear and little bit less bodier than usual weizen beers. It is like a typical lager style i think but it has unique notes of taste and it is very permanant senses for every bottle.\n",
      "Bottle. Hazy golden colour with a medium fine pored white head, nose is yeasty, bready and a bit fruity and spicy with notes of iced biscuit cake, banana and cloves, taste is sweet, fruity and bready with a tart and slightly boozy finish.\n",
      "Drickes 2 SVT under sommaren 2019. En drickes i Djursvik. Underbar doft o redan här vet du att det är en riktig höjdaröl. Smaken är SÅ balanserad. Choklad nougat lite kaffe med bourbontwist. Söt krämig rund o go eftersmak med en fin mjuk beska som ligger o skvalpar i gomseglet.\n",
      "Bottle at Fierce. It pours hazy bright yellow with a decent foamy white head. The aroma is musty bright, funk, peach, yellow plum, spicy, hay, kitty litter and granny smith apple. The taste is crisp, soft, sweet, juicy, tangy, musty, funky, earthy, yellow plum, lactic, leather, soft fruits, must, funk and leather with a drying finish. Medium body and decent, foamy white head.

      "Let sprittet. Mørke malte og europæiske humler. Er ikke alt for god i humlen i eftersmagen.\n",
      "Impatto visivo piacevole, un bel nero impenetrabile, schiuma abbondante, fine color cappuccino ma poco persistente. Al naso notevoli note di caffè in polvere e qualche nota di cacao. In bocca spicca per un corpo importante, subito si sente il gusto da caffè addolcito da note di cioccolato e vaniglia. Retrogusto abbastanza amaro di caffè.\n",
      "Muito suave, baixa acidez e caramelizada, excelente cerveja que não necessita acompanhamentos.\n",
      "Beaucoup de volonté  avec cette bière qui mousse abondamment. In liquide noir et une dentelle épaisse et éparse. Ça sent vraiment bon; un mélange de grains grillés, de rainette de type chinotto avec ses touches de zeste d'orange. Un peu de menthe aux côtés d'autres herbes aromatisantes, de houblons et d'herbes. Des saveurs semblables tout en étant différentes à la fois: amères de la façon douces et acidulées, sans astringence, des conifères d'automne remis de sève, de réglisse noire, fruitées comme dans certain cocktail, boisées doucement. Collante et corpulente. C'est délicieux. J'ai adoré! (E 29/04/19 D661-662) (2895-270919)\n",

      "The Aromas are exactly what the label says a blend of barley wine and Imperial Stout. Cocoa, roast, nougat, Oak, coffee and dark malt. Flavors are much more sweet than bitter, a hint metallic at first, soft but good carbonation Lush body with coffee in the Finish and a little booze. Amazing beer.\n",
      "My favorite beer if 2019!!! The perfect balance of west coast/east coast style IPA just makes my mouth water.\n",
      "Super malty caramel flavors pop with sweet candy flavor. Stays clean and drinkable though. Super dark mahogany pour. Some beige head. Just amazing.\n",
      "500 ml can. Pours a clear gold color with thick white head and great retention. Good lacing. Grain and malt aroma. Lively carbonation. Lightly sweet, smooth lager flavor with creamy, bready finish. Really clean mouthfeel. Medium body. Not bitter. Great beer! Infinitely repeatable. Prost!\n",
      "Bomber from Tavour shared by my daughter. Nose is pumpkin, nutmeg, cloves, nuttiness, and cinnamon. Black with a medium cinnamon tan head. Flavor is moderately sweet pumpkin pie with spices and a hint of bitter from the syrupy body. Pretty nice.\n",
      "Obtained at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $21.99, Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a coffee stout fermented and barrel aged in French oak barrels brewed by the Libertine Brewing Company from San Luis Obispo, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields acidity, lemon, Brettanomyces funk, and chocolate upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a finger of beige head. When held up to light, the surface shifts into a dark brown hue. The alcohol content is 8.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lemony, citrus body greets you with a sourness on the take followed by a lactic mouthfeel. Cherries sweeten the complexion and adds a tart to the take. As the lemon mellows, chocolate malt provides a discernible texture to the comprehension. Roasted malt accompanies the chocolate. Lactose brings a light, silky tone to the malty base. Espresso accents the chocolate and lactose while slightly bitters the comprehension. Brettanomyces yeast dries and funks the lemon and cherry finish. French oak delivers a woodsy touch to the lemon and lactic bouquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Libertine Wild Coffee Stout is a ravishing coffee stout. The lemon, cherries, chocolate malt, lactose, espresso, and funky Brettanomyces yeast blend amazingly into a one of a kind beer. The combination of sour, tart, and acidity is easy to experience and beautiful to the malty frame. The lactose eases the drink. The espresso and French oak are dazzling to the malty feel. I cherished every single drink and impressed by its complexity. In the end, this brew is more sour than stout, so be informed before buying this bottle.\n",

      "Golden straw and very clear, the body has a few bubbles showing as well but there's no sign of any real head. There was a tonne of sweetness on the nose with some corn and sugars but it seemed more like an iced tea with only some skunk notes at the end signalling it was a beer. The taste was similarly sweet upfront with a lot of sugars but quickly turned bitter with some corn and cheap, almost off-adjuncts. There wasn't much to the beer really, with some artificial sugars seeing things out and the body was a very light with a thin feel that lacked balance too; terrible stuff and definitely one to avoid. \n",

      "One left in my fridge by my brother in-law after his family’s stay at my place. Might as well rate which is weird to do after 5k rates on this site.  If asked my least favorite beer in world for last 2 decades this would be my choice, although it’s been many years since I had last. I often would say 4 of these would give same hangover as 12 Busch light at least I used to say that 20 years ago, long before my beer snobbishness.  Pale yellow brew with a smallish white head. Nose is light sour mash and wet cardboard.  Tastes of corn, grain, wet dog, and tears.  Some urine qualities in after taste. More bitter than I recall.  I my beer journeys since college I’ve had less drinkable swill but casual conversation I’ll still say this is my least favorite brew.\n",
      "can in Manchester VT --- 2/26/19 --- Aroma of malt and light hops.  Hazy amber brown color, ivory head that drops to a thick rim, wide bands of lace.  Taste is malt with an odd hops addition on a lightly carbonated swallow.  Medium finish which actually can't get over soon enough.  I think this is past its prime.  Too bad, but if I pay for it, I rate it.\n",
      "Oh dear, what a pint of wasted opportunity. A long drink of nothing from a brewery that could've used this event to promote something decent. Colour, flavour, texture all pale - in the manner of paling into blandness.\n",
      "Smells like malt. Tastes like malt. Probably malt then. Why bother with any other ingredients if you can get away with this and for some reason beyond understanding people are buying it? Where are all those hops mentioned in the description; cancelled each other out maybe?\n",
      "backlog from summer: clear golden colour, large, dense white head; aroma of canned apple, apple peel and some malts; taste also has  strong canned apple notes and some artificial rum notes - more like a Sweet apple cider than a beer based on its taste and aroma, which is really strange\n",

      "Draft at Cugino’s, served in a smaller glass. Pours a hazy maroon color with a small pink head that settles into a ring. Notes of boysenberry, blackberry, cream, vanilla, wheaty and doughy malts, salt, and coriander. Medium-bodied, with soft carbonation and a fruity, sweet, malty, and barely sweet mouthfeel. Sweeter and wheatier than some others.\n",
      "12 oz can, poured black with tan head.  Full body.    Chocolate and licorice aroma.  Boozy cocoa and roasted grain taste.  Sweet malt finish.\n",
      "Solid IPA. Good hoppy and floral aroma. Bitter but not harsh. Balanced with a honey sweetness from the malt.\n",
      "650 ml bottle from Canada Craft Club.  Pours a cloudy caramel colour with modest-sized cream coloured head.  Aroma is sweetish caramel, grass and gentle toastiness.  Flavour is modestly sweet toffee, some tree fruit, light grass and a hint of toasted grains.  Body verging on medium.  Solid amber.\n",
      "Average Kolsch beer. Light yellow color. Crisp and clean with cereal malt flavors.\n",
      "Draft at Cugino’s, served in a smaller glass. Pours a hazy ruby color with a finger of pink head that settles into a thick ring that curves into a thin film while totally lacing the glass. Notes of boysenberry, raspberry, blueberry, cream, vanilla, sweet and doughy malts, salt, and coriander. Medium-bodied, with soft carbonation and a fruity, tart, sweet mouthfeel. Really tasty.\n",
      "Crisp and light body. Cereal and corn flavor. Mild aroma. Low hops with a pleasant lager yeast finish.\n",
      "Pretty basic Pilsner. Mild grain aroma. Light golden color and light body.  Sweet grain flavor.\n",
      "16 oz. can from Cappy's shared with drsordr and Corey. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small plus sized light khaki colored head. The aroma and flavor have roasted malts, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, coffee, basically a solid sessionable (wink) old school imperial stout.\n",

      "Bottle picked up from Biervana, München and consumed at home Attenkirchen, Sunday 2nd February 2020 whilst in the midst of a day of cooking, we've made Cream of Cauliflower Soup, Red Lentil and Tomato Soup, Granola, a large Hungarian Goulash, Roasted a Pork Joint and also making Potatoes and Smoked Garlic. We're listening to Balthazar - Rats. Think is excellent, smoke (lots of) but smooth and easy drinking. Sweet and even a little fish edge also some smoked honey. Glad I got a couple of these, this is great.\n",
      "Can shared by alexsdad06 pour opaque cola to black with minimal tan head. Nose sweet chocolate, red fruit, coffee. Taste chocolate, coffee, red fruit, light roast. Tasty.\n",
      "16oz can at home, via FL oddly enough.      Call me crazy, I was expecting this to be hazy from NH, but it’s mostly clear golden bronze with a thin off-white head.  Fruity nose and flavors - papaya, pineapple, sweet mango, but also an odd note of old apricots. Low carb, light body.  Sweet finish, very lightly hopped.  Ok.\n",
      "Cans from GS brew pub store, neat label. Pours a golden amber with a creamy head. Smooth delicate and fresh - citrus peel and grass and smooth malt and candy citrus/pale fruit. Nice mingling citrus flavors in the finish, kind of like 3-fruit marmalade but with a snappy fresh dryness. What balance. Aroma has a whiff of the freshest mandarin.\n",
      "16 oz. can from Cappy's shared with drsordr and Corey. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small off white head that settles into a thin film. The aroma and flavor have pale malts, some sweetness, smooth, citrus, tropical fruit, melon, light earthy character but not what I would expect from a triple dry hopped Mosaic imperial IPA.\n",

      "Lightly cloudy golden with a fading white head. Lightly briney citrusy limey aroma with some mango and light soursop. Nice gently tart limey and mango salty flavor that’s not too heavy on the salt but has a nice salinic undertone.\n",
      "Can shared by alexsdad06 pour clear gold with moderate white head. Nose macerated fruit, dank, light grass. Taste similar to nose, lots of fruit. Surprisingly no grass or onion.\n",
      "Can (10/29/19) pour. Appearance is orange-yellow with tons of effervescent sparkle, finger-width foamy white head with decent retention and mildest lacing. Aroma is strong, sweet fruit, spicy. Taste is passionfruit, citrus bite. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth, thick texture, lively carbonation (biting the tongue), hint of alcohol warmth deep in the esophagus and finish as taste. Overall, strong and enjoyable aroma and flavor but not complex. Hops just out of peak freshness so may be better fresh.\n",
      "16 oz. can shared by drsordr. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium plus sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale malts, lightly toasted, mild sweetness, citrus and earthy hops, grass, some onion character but this is a well put together beer, I am always cautious with 100% Mosaic hopped beers but this was very good.\n",
      "Can pours a super clear, bright golden color with a big fluffy white head that lingers leaving curtains of lace on glass. Smells of citrus fruit, bread herbs, perfume and pine. Taste of sweet bread, grapefruit, lemon bread, and resin. Light body, super carbonated, soft mouthfeel and a dry finish. Crisp, clean, dry and tasty! Superb!\n",
      "16 oz can from Joe Canal's, 2/4/20.  Hazy gold, white head, strong lace.  Grapefruit, pineapple, melon, and a little apricot.  Nice juicy flavor, solidly sweet, mildly bitter.  Pretty nice.\n",

The aroma and flavor have pale malts, dank tropical fruit and citrus, resin, a hint of cleaner, some bitterness, good but I would pass in the future.\n",

      "Draft at The Partisan. Pours coca-cola brown with a khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Lots of bourbon and coffee on the nose and tongue. I’m getting a trace of cinnamon on the finish. Hides it’s booze very well\n",
      "Bottle pours very hazy light gold. Pretty fruity hop aroma. Healthy carbonation, Brett, sticky floral hops. Wouldn't have guessed it's 8% but it is a bit of a heavier saison on terms of body. I like that the Brett is there and mixes well with the hops but doesn't overpower the beer.\n",
      "Aroma is citrus/fruit and slightly earthy malts.  The flavor is citrus/fr, earthy malts and a West Coast ipa bitter hop finish.\n",
      "Chicory, coffee, chocolate malt, and hay aroma.   Dark brown with large brown head.   Moderately sweet coffee chocolate malt, and mildly bitter chicory, coffee grounds, and hay aroma.  Good body.     Very tasty - strong chicory presence.\n",
      "Growler from Whole Foods.  Poured very dark brown opaque with pretty tan head.  Full bodied, with licorice, molasses and roasted grain prominent in the aroma.  Great, complex taste - licorice, sweet milk chocolate , wood and bourbon notes.  Chocolate mildly boozy finish.\n",
      "Clear, tawny blonde pour with a tall, sticky white head.  Squat 12oz bottle, Fair label.  Doughy, yeasty aroma with vegetal hops. It has a good malt bill, moderate bitterness, and is biscuity.  Hops really come through on the back end.  Not esteric or fruity. OK, drinkable.  ABC Liquors, Bull Run.\n",
      "Pours dirty yellow, unfiltered cloudy with a white, fully lasting, 1-finger head that leaves very good lacing. Aroma of sweet tropical fruit, hay  and calgon dish detergent. Medium body, lightly bitter and light to medium sweet, average carbonation, flavors of pineapple, apples and  black tea. Finish is lightly bitter, brief and dry. Very good.\n",
      "2013 vintage. 0,5l bottle. Pours dark brown with no head. Aroma of oak, whisky, slight smoke, malt, vanilla, toffee, dark fruits. Taste is peat, oak, malt, toffee, vanilla. Finishes on a peat smoked, malty finish.\n",

      "Bottle from the local Raleys. Pours clear, bright copper with a nice near-white head. Intense aroma of citrus/pine - not very resin tho. Mouthfeel is somewhat lush (bottle is 3 weeks old) and about med body. Flavor is citrus/pine on the verge of hop burn. Supporting slightly roasty malt. This is very good stuff.\n",
      "Delightful to the nose and the palate.  very Smooth, and yet with just enough English ‘gun metal’ character to let you know it’s from across the Atlantic.  At  5 abv can be sipped for a nice extended session.\n",
      "Pint can from Tree House. Pours a milky yellow gold with a large frosty white head. Aroma of pineapple, mango, orange and hops. Taste of light mango, pineapple, orange and galaxy hops. Very nice.\n",

      "My go to beer. Better than any of the basic light beers, and cheaper too. Maybe not the best beer ever, but its 5 bucks a 6 pack.\n",
      "Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Definitely get orange on aroma with bourbon notes of molasses, caramel and brown sugar along with cocoa and hazelnuts. Thick and chewy hiding ABV very well. Complex with orange, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, vanilla. Excellent.\n",
      "Purchased at Gerrard’s Market from Redlands, California for $13.99, Primrose is a hybrid ale aged in oak barrels and blended with Northern California Malbec grapes brewed by Tahoe Mountain Brewing Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of Malbec grapes, Brettanomyces funk, and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a purplish red with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malbec grapes have a ravishing, flavorful hue to the body. Brettanomyces yeast follows the fruity grapes with a soft funky touch along with a lactic tart tinge to the mouthfeel. Plums rounds out the body before the beer starts waning into the dry finish. Lemon provides a light citrus feel that compliments the lactic yeast and serves as an undertone. Oak gives a woodsy touch to the yeast, grape, and lemon frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primrose is an exquisite hybrid ale. The Malbec grapes, funky Brettanomyces yeast, plums, and lemon blend together into a spectacular craft beer. The Malbec grapes and funk harmonize tastefully. Plums brings a fullness to the wine-like Malbec body. The sour and tart are easy to experience and pleasant to the complexion. I absolutely loved drinking this beer. The blend of wine and beer is exemplary. This is an outstanding craft beer; do not pass this up if you manage to find it.\n",

      "On tap at source. Pours jet black with a dirty tan head clinging to the glass. Aroma is chocolate, cinammon, maple syrup, treacle, coffee. Taste is a big coffee hit with chocolate and maple mellowing out the bitter roast coffee leaving a sweet maple syrup finish. A hint of booze but so well balanced. Absolutely stunning.\n",
      "Flaska från Belgiuminabox. Skum sprutar ur flaskan men som ganska snabbt sansar sig och snarare visar prov på livlighet i doft och smak. Eteriska estrar, gyllene säd, jästkultur, honung, jord, kalk, blommig nektar. En riktigt bra livlig trippel som har allt man kan önska i stilen. Spritsighet, balans, smakdjup. Riktigt riktigt gott. En närmast perfekt trippel. \n",

      "Deep clear dark brown hue with a thin beige sticky cap. Big semisweet peanut aroma with a hint of cocoa and sweet peanut butter. Smooth semisweet flavor that’s dark and toasty malty with a hint of cocoa and lots of semisweet roasty peanut butter. Lovely and nutty and toasty and semisweet and flavorful.\n",
      "Clear deep reddish brown with a thin off white cap. Lovely nose of semisweet cocoa and toasty malt. Smooth brown malty flavor with a little cocoa and sweet chocolaty tones on a balanced dark malty finish.\n",

      "Bottle, 750 ml from the brewery. Shared with JFK10000, Miro B and Max. Hazy golden, white head. Some barnyard, citric, peach, nectarine, very sour, medium bodied. Brett. Fruity tartness, puckering.\n",

      "Has big solid foam on a heavily carbonated gold body, smells like wet sugar and bread crumbs. Flavour is wet breadcrumbs with sweet caramel and tin on the back end. Full enough mouthfeel. There are certainly worse low alcohols out there, this one's passable.\n",
      "Would be a decent cider with better quality control. 2 of 3 six packs, purchased over a 4 week period,  were sulfur tainted (due to starving the yeast during fermentation). Brewer is slow to reimburse for the nasty sulfur cider.\n",
      "On tap at Bomber, pours a cloudy muffled golden with a tiny head. Aroma brings out lots of lacto, light dry hops, and some pithy stone fruits. Flavour is seriously messed up, with harsh hops, some nasty chemical notes (butyric?), and lacto. This is all sorts of messed up. Undrinkable.\n",
      "Bouteille - 500ml. Robe de couleur paille, bien voilée, effervescente et coiffée d'une écume blanche mince mais persistante. Arôme malté et agrémenté de nuances florales, herbacées mais aussi de nettoyant industriel. En bouche, on retrouve les mêmes pointes savonneuses qui gâchent toute l'expérience. Des notes de cuir/vinyl sont aussi décelables. Brève finale citronnée/herbacée. Un désastre de la part d'un brasseur qui nous a habitués à beaucoup mieux au cours de la dernière année. Drainpour.\n",
      "Bottle 35.5cl. @home poured into a pint glass. Cloudy deep amber, a lot of small bubbles, small fizzy off-white head, vanishes quickly; aroma strawberry, bubblegum, candy sugar, toffee; taste heavy sweet and light acidity, strawberry, bubblegum, candy sugar; light body, sticky texture; the light acidity is no match for the overwhelming cloying sweetness, also too artificial.\n",
      "Oops, picked up this can of IPA by accident, thought it was a milk stout, oh well. Well, it is pretty hazy but not muddy as name would indicate. Smell is muted IPA perfume. Rude crude uninteresting bitterness like any other IPA. As a matter of fact, this is more bitter than many double IPA I've had. Yes, just another one of a billion IPA out there, not much difference. I guess the politically correct term for craft beer nowadays is IPA. What ever  -  WTF?  Not impressed, the hops cover any imperfections the beer may actually have. Tastes is almost identical the the double IPA I just had, or is this the problem with IPA; after you drink a good one, your taste buds are ruined for an hour or so? Let me simply ask: Do you like chewing on a fresh rubber inner tube mixed with green grapefruit rinds and old weathered pine tar sap, chased with turpentine? Just asking. One rude straight up ass beer style.\n",
      "So here we are, the strange chief of police. Well, I guess its a close resemblance to Harbour. At almost 10% no wonder why you feel like you used to live out a carefree existence - yet haunted by a troubled past. Pours out a bit thick and hazy. Smell in non-offensive but the taste really kicks your ass. The amount of hop bitterness makes it a one sided flavor that would cover any possible beer imperfections. Whew. There you have it; terribly on style, go figger. Its just another one of a quadra-million purposefully high-hopped beers out there. At least it was in a bottle.\n",
      "Dumpf getreidiger, hell herber Beginn. Trocken, wenig bitter. Konstante Aromatik, langweilig, trockener Abgang. 9/7/8/6/9/6\n",
      "500ml bottle. Clear, chestnut colour with ruby glimmer and average to huge, thick, creamy, moderately lasting, minimally lacing, off-white head. Herbal and fruity aroma, slightly strange, sugary, artificial notes of cola, a touch of cherry, \"Wassereis\". Taste is sugary sweet and slightly fruity, notes of cola, hints of cherry, artificial sweetener; medicamentous. dry finish. Quite crappy.\n",
      "Pounder: Rotten raspberry, vanilla, garbage nose. Cloudy pink, thin head. Raspberry, coconut, cocoa. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Pretty much a mess.\n",

      "Black beer with very short light brown head, smell is sour - not more, taste is light and short roasty malts, light bread, very light watery, no coffee or others, thin texture, average carbonation, medium body, boring\n",
      "Coded 135 9 2, 3802 0503.  Typical Laggy bottle. Smells like viscous IPA. Pour is pale with chunks in it. All floating around and shit, but surprisingly still. Head fades to 1/2 inch. First taste is just the most plainly rude straight up ass IPA I've had in a fortnight, it must be imperial. I swear it almost gives me a gag reflex, but not. Come now, how is this not in the IPA style? Too big boozy & bosomed for an APA. Just asking. Pretty soon they are gonna have to make a new style APA wannahbee IPA. Yes, terribly on style with the best of the IPA and many imperial IPA, or should I say double IPA, or should I say double imperial india pale ale? JMHO, there you have it. Yes, this is not an APA, please change the style admin, hehehehhh.\n",
      "Nope. Looks like a really nice pint in the glass but from the very first sip it's a wrong 'un. Where are the ingredients? Barely anything on the nose, thin and a little oily and no flavour. The very faintest distant wave of hops and not even malt. Nothing's happening here.\n",

      "Canette - 473ml. Robe brune, moyennement effervescente et coiffée d'un mince col blanc cassé et mousseux. Arôme malté/houblonné équilibré et agrémenté de nuances sucrées et boisées. En bouche, c'est fidèle à l'arôme. Bonne finale boisée. Pas mal.\n",
      "Bottle - American strong might be the best overall classification for this, but it reads really British in character to me - hazy ruby - rich earthy (maybe some golden promise and marris) sweet malt similar to a scotch ale - moderate spiciness, dark bread, caramelized sugars - moderate bitterness, more American in character, finishes - hearty and warming - very good.\n",
      "Pretty chestnut, fluffy tan head.Nice chocolate nose and palate. Light berries in taste.Smooth and quaffable, bit a bit thin\n",
      "Cloudy amber, head dissipates immediately. Dry salty nose. Quite tart fruity palate. Not really a fan\n",
      "473ml can. Opaque, quasi black colour with small to average, forth yto creamy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, tan head. Sweet-ish, chocolately dark malty and spicy aroma, notes of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate sauce, some vanilla, cinnamon, peppery spicy and minimally smoky whiffs of chipotle. Taste is sweet, chocolately dark malty and spicy, notes of cinnamon and vanilla, peppery spicy, minimally smoky notes of chipotle bring that typical effect of increasing, accumulating hotness. Oily to viscous texture, smooth and soft palate, completely hidden alcohol. Exactly what it wants to be (Mexican Hot Chocolate) but not in an Imperial way; spiciness really pushes the envelope without crossing the line to discomfort. Pretty good.\n",
      "16-ounce can purchased in January 2020 with an ABV of 8.7. Pours hazy yellow-gold with a 1/4\" bubbly beige head and residual lacing. Aroma: citrus. Flavor: grapefruit, lemon, orange, pineapple, mango, pine. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied, a slick to oily finish.\n",
      "On tap at the Only Cafe.  Pours a clear golden colour with plus-sized white head.  Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits with some sweet maltiness.  Flavour is orange, grapefruit and floral happiness with sweet biscuity maltiness.  Modest bitterness in finish.  Nice.\n",

Flavour has lots of pine with some citric character and strong toffee and grainy maltiness.   Not overly boozy.  Medium-full body.  Nice.\n",
      "This radler poured a cloudy, medium yellow colour with a ultra, fizzy, Bright white, carbonated head. Minimal lacing. Scents include A little bit of peach, must and dough. First swig was quite thin and watery with flavours of light peach, club soda and must. Finish is very light with that minimal peach flavour lingering slightly.\n",
      "Bottle.  Cloudy amber coloured beer with a strong white head.  The aroma is yeasty and bitter, and the flavour is strongly bitter with yeastiness and a dry finish.  Overall a nice beer.\n",
      "Gifted to me. Pours nearly clear yellow with almost no head and no lacing, just a ring. Aromas are sweet and citrus-pithy. Flavors follow, only mild bitterness, but I just don't enjoy that pith note. Very smooth, with a surprisingly light mouthfeel. It's okay, but glad I only have one.\n",

      "Bottle from the no-longer-open Brewklopedia, Leicester. Hazy and slightly pinkish yellow with the tiniest ring of white head. Nasal passages are slightly burned by the intense tartness to the aroma. Lemon juice, raspberry, intense mothball funk. Amazing mouth-puckering taste. The sourness fills the whole mouth and longer a long after the sip. More lemon and tart berry in the aftertaste. Medium to heavy carbonation. Special.\n",

      "Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.\n",

      "Can in a trade with tfontana, thanks Tom. 11-20-19 canning. Pushing the limits on hop freshness on this one! But it all works out in the end! Aroma: bold tropical fruit, soft malt.

Aroma of dark chocolate, chocolate orange, light roasted malt, caramel, coffee, dried fruit and a touch of liquorice. Medium sweetness and light to moderate bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. Very nice.\n",
      "500ml bottle from local Tesco. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma: malt dominates with hoppy hints. Taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate bitter with the roasted malts overpowering the hops. Hints of dary berry fruits and pine. Medium bodied, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish. It's OK but the hops need to shine more and roasted malts to be less dominant for it to be a decent BIPA, for me\n",
      "473ml can. Hazy, bright, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, osteoporosing, moderately lacing, white head. Slightly cautious, juicy, tropical fruity, hoppy aroma, hints of tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, oaty malty background; resinous and piney notes become laid bare belatedly, a touch of peanut alike, embedded in a mild orange and mandarine cushion. Taste is sweet-ish, wheaty and slightly dry, oaty malty, minimally sugary, unspecific and not overly intense, fruity hoppy, some tropical fruit, some mandarine and orange; again, the initially disguised resinous and piney hoppy core becomes laid bare delayed, only accompanied by diffident mandarine and orange flavours. Minimally mushy texture, smooth and soft palate. Overall too well-behaved, reserved, withdrawn concerning fruity hoppy aspects; with all them fruity flavours evaporated remains a very harmonious and balanced, biscuity pale malty and resinous hoppy DIPA. Somehow like an mediocre Imperial NEIPA in Kernel clothing. So what has to be rated here? I'm indecisive. For now an unmotivated compromise.\n",

      "This beer is a legend.  Well balanced.  Nice citrus notes.  Clean, crisp, refreshing.\n",
      "Poured into pint glass.  Dark amber color with frothy head.   First taste was big and bold and I didn’t think I was worthy.  But after a couple drinks this beer keeps you wanting more.   Great beer to enjoy while making dinner.  I will be buying more in the future\n",
      "Lemon-pine nose, some sweet orange notes. Medium body, lots of hop flavors without excessive bitterness. Very slight malty sweetness. Crisp and refreshing. Pleasant bitter finish. Doesn't have the complexity of the great hazy IPAs, but nevertheless, a good drink.\n",
      "World class IPA at a great price.  Can’t beat this IPA as a weekly go-to beer. Moderate citrus and bitterness.\n",
      "Strong coffee and chocolate flavor and taste.\n",
      "Very rich, mellow and deep.\n",
      "Sweet like chocolate, bitter like coffee, besides milky and woody. \n",
      "Moderate carbonation.\n",
      "Definitely night-cap drink.\n",
      "Amazing.\n",
      "Cracking this with two good mates on my 40th birthday as a night cap after a day of solid beer drinking. This big, bad boozy bastard is a huge beer. It’s thick and warming. It’s quite sweet, almost molasses in sickly sweetness. I understand why this is so highly sought after, it’s a great beer and a perfect way to end my 40th birthday. \n",
      "\n",
      "12 oz bottle. Pours deep dark brown to black. Aroma of cocoa, chocolate, roasted grain, raisins, wood, whiskey, vanilla, peat.  Flavor of cocoa, vanilla, wood, bourbon, prune, peat.  Very complex flavors. Quite a nice beer.\n",
      "Jan 1 2020:\n",
      "On tap St Augustine’s in Vancouver. The light in St Aug’s is mercifully dim, wink 😉, but looks to be a blackish beer with a pale head.. \n",
      "\n",
      "A quick whiff of the top of the 5 oz jigger plainly reveals its cafe espresso history, and a cautious sip consists mainly of cocoa. Further sips show a nice balance of coffee and cocoa, tending more toward cocoa. Very seasonal for January, but contrary to the popular opinion of ratebeerians, it’d take something more to make this beer complex, and I’m not finding it. No doubt my lack! 😉\n",
      "12oz can.  Thick, murky orange body.  Big, foamy, white head.  medium bodied, very easy drinking and refreshing.  Big apple tone, lesser lemon.  Tart up front, smooth sweet finish.  Rather enjoyable for the style.\n",
      "Smells like a wine Black & Mild cigarillo. Heavy notes of vanilla, stewed berries, pipe tobacco, and faint spice. Very sweet, tangy mouthfeel with a bite. Long haunting finish. Crazy good.\n",
      "Canette de 473 ml. Coulleur blanche/blonde avec un joli col blanc. Arômes de banane et d'épices. Goût de céréales grillées, de fruits doux, d'herbes et d'épices. Bonne bière.\n",
      "Accidentally opened when I went to the fridge for food, saw none, and grabbed a beer instead. Bottle courtesy of Drake! Light gold, slightest hint of haze, white head. Dried floral hops, grasses, leaf, and bready aroma. Smooth green and brown leaf, grasses, light cracker. Hint of sweetness in there.\n",
      "Tap at the brewery. \n",
      "Deep red brown with a little head and lace. \n",
      "Aroma is lifted and concentrated. Dried fruit. Aged Vintage Port. Intense, heave yet fresh. \n",
      "Palate is massive. Hint of sweetness yet not dominating. Big structure but not bitter. \n",
      "No hint of sluggish ferments. \n",
      "\n",
      "12.7 oz waxed. Aroma is wood, vegetable soup, Schezwan sauce, chocolate, coconut, sherry. Pours black with a thin tan quickly collapsing head. Taste is highly sweet, never cloying, savory, some tartness, with flavors of chocolate, coconut, toffee, oak. Nothing wrong with the mouthfeel. Tastes a lot better than it smells. Kind of a disappointment overall, but it's not bad at all. Just a bit weird and definitely overrated.\n",
      "Cloudy straw gold with foamy lacy white head\n",
      "Aroma is rich floral hoppy \n",

      "Can at home bought from cloudwater website. This beer had a haze to it which was not expected. This is the best gose I've ever had and it was refreshing and fruity. Damn its good\n",
      "can at home. The beer poured hazy and thick. This is yet another great neon raptor beer.It was hoppy and fruity. This everything I expect to get from a NEIPA\n",
      "İçimi kolay ve zengin aromalı güzel bir İngiliz Ipa birası. Fıcı ve şişe seçimiyle İstanbulda görmek keyif verici.\n",
      "Stout bira severler için özellikle fıcı alternatifi ile İstanbullulara keyif veren güzel İngiliz birası tavsiye ederim..\n",
      "Gerçekten tatlı bira severleri için özellikle bal sevdalısı kişlilere mutluluk katacak bir bira İstanbul’da fıcısını içebilirsiniz..\n",
      "Gerçekten beğendiğim en güzel bitter biralardan özellikle İstanbul’da bulabileceğiniz nadir İngiliz birası afiyetler olsun...\n",
      "Unbelievable.  Unpasteurized sake listed as Mama on the bottle.  Daknole has it right with the details... Honeydew and muskmelon, vanilla, edible flowers like orchids.  This is quite a delight.  Sought this out, as we want to try all the American made sake.  Glad we did, despite the $28/375 price.  Picked up at Vino Di Sedona.\n",
      "The Aromas are Citrus hops and pale malt. Flavors are similar to nose, get more interesting with some peaches, sweetness that is very nicely balanced with great carbonation and rounding out with a full body and excellent finish. Very good beer.\n",
      "Obtained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $4.00, Pecan Pie Porter is an American Imperial Porter crafted by Clown Shoes Beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air yields chocolate, espresso, and lactose upon the nose. The appearance is black that pours a low beige head. When light reflects off of the beer, a dark mahogany hue shows. The alcohol content is 8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate is soft and rich to the complexion. Lactose smoothens the take and creams the comprehension. Caramel fairly thickens the composition and glistens the lactose mouthfeel. Espresso flavors the chocolate and lactose body and slightly bitters the take. Pecan laces and accents the chocolate and espresso frame. Cinnamon is sensible with the espresso and pecan notes. Honey malt sweetens the beer and tangible with the caramel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pecan Pie Porter is a delectable American Imperial Porter. The chocolate, lactose, caramel, espresso, and pecan combine into an incredibly delicious beer. The lactose makes the beer incredibly light and tones the chocolate profile. The caramel and honey malt combination comes across syrupy. Pecan is prominent from the start into the malty finish. I loved drinking Pecan Pie Porter and discovered an alluring craft beer. This is really good and offers an immersive complexity to the drink.\n",

      "Phenomenal beer, purchased online from the SAQ, the Brett and oak aging neutralize each other to make such a sweet and complex beer that is why one drinks beer. Kudos!\n",
      "Well hey hey (we're the Monkish), I'm the first to tick this on here, and that's something to be proud of because it was EPPPIIIIIIICCK!!! This is going to be one of my highest rated beers in the last few years. The appearance is great, dark chestnut with a lasting beige head. Aroma is amazing, toffee, honeysuckle (a rare flavor note but definitely there), dates, figs, bourbon, vanilla. The flavor is also awesome, medium sweet but not overly so, no BS American-style hopping, smooth floral honeysuckle and cakey dark fruit, and don't forget the bourbs. Medium-plus body but insanely drinkable for what it is. I recall few beers that caused the #BiLgasm this did. Yes, barleywine, you are life. Thank you for reminding me.\n",

      "Seasonal Wildflower Wit is back! A follow-up to the Elderflower Wit in the springtime, the brewer will continue to release this style each season, combining local & wildcrafted ingredients to subtly enhance a classic style.  Almost 600 years ago in the Belgian village of Hoegaarden, a band of monks experimented by adding oddball botanicals from halfway around the world to their traditional wheat beer. Inspired by their creation, our brewer freshly foraged sumac to put into the kettle, alongside lemondrop hops, and dried lemon peels.\n",

      "24 oz. can purchased at Total Wine in Denton, TX. Pours a clear light gold color with a fizzy white head and poor retention. No lacing. Lightly sour malts aroma. Similar sour-ish corn malt flavor. Light body. Mouthfeel like club soda. $1.50 per can and it tasted like it, but at least it's better than the Regal Brau Light.\n",
      "Bought from puddletown stores, bottled. Within throwing distance of brewery. Poured with a massive, soapy head that wouldn’t subside. Bland, kinda  flavourless and not really that easy to drink. Won’t be opening the second bottle unfortunately.\n",
      "Pours hazy reddish with a fizzy pink colored head. Aroma is sweet with fruity and sugary notes. Taste is bittersweet. Begins with sweet and sugary flavours of fruits and raspberry, slightly artificial rhabarber flavour too. Finishes with moderate sourness. Sweet and sugary, but still somehow  watery overall. I definitely prefer the Kinld Weisse without any sweeteners over this one. (Poured from a 0,33l bottle, bb 11/20)\n",

      "Sour milk, light biscuit malt, and straw aroma.   Hazy golden yellow with large white head.  Mildly sweet biscuit malt, mild sour lactic acid, and very lightly bitter straw flavor.    Plastic aftertaste.    Chloro-phenols - possibly old - wasn't too pleasant.\n",

      "So its a can of the ultimate balance of the finest beer ingredients made out of the best water from the elusive spring of life? Looks like any other generic first generation clear pale IPA. Tastes like any other crisp fresh IPA. Rude as all hell as with any well made ubiquitous IPA. Terribly rubbery chewing on rubber inner-tube mixed with sightly fermenting green grapefruit pulp all coated with spruce tree sap. Good thing it smells better than it tastes. Yes, just another on-style one of a quadre-quintillion other IPA's out there.\n",

Cloudy bright reddish burnt sienna color with a medium thin frothy off-white head that diminishes gradually to a film. Short strings of lace. Aroma of tropical fruits, wheat and malt.

      "Pours a cloudy, ruby red coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smells of tart rasperry and zesty lime, with a distinct acidity. Taste is a great balance of slightly sweet and quite tart raspberry and rather zesty lime, with a good lactic acidity and light salinity. Finishes with a medium tartness and some raspberry and lime lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and mesium carbonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rather nice Gose that is recognizable as the style despite being flavored, with a good lactic acidity, subtle saltiness and very little sweetness coming through. The raspberry and lime work together rather well, forming a very enjoyable flavor profile. Very crisp and refreshing, makes for a great summer beer.\n",

Light lager malts, clean and with a pleasing mild sweetness. Crisp pine and crisp orange hops, touches of tangerine and grapefruit. Trace of citric peel. Crisp bright finish. Sometimes a later is the only beer that will do and this is a bloody good one.\n",

Spotty lace. Aroma of oak, tart fruit, yeast and malt. Light to medium body with flavors of gin, tart citrus, vinous oak and juniper.

      "Sample at the taproom during the \"Streetside 3 Year Anniversary Bash!\" on 09/28/2019. Slightly hazy amber-orange color with a medium thin white head that recedes steadily to an outer ring.

The finish is oaky and tart with a wine grape aftertaste. Pretty good all around.\n",

Sweet-ish, fruity, raspberry dominated aroma, some cherry, some fruit acid, slight sherbet character overall.

      "Bottle from Beermoth, Manchester.  Extremely dark and certainly strong tasting, this slow sipper does have a velvet smoothness to its roasted malts that's very pleasant once you get used to the alcohol content in this one.  Sat in my cellar for over 6 years but absolutely fine when opened.\n",

      "Pours hazy amber orange with a fast-fading off white head that leaves just a rim and coating. Aroma is dank jungle citrus. Taste brings the sweet funk - and a hoppy bitterness out the back. Nice crisp-biscuit malt backbone. Moderate carbonation; cloying and somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter and sticky. Not too boozy. Very good but I prefer a bit more fruit these days.\n",
      "75cl bottle at home, bought in Mikkeller Webshop. Appearance: hazy light straw with medium sized white head.  Aroma: grassy, wild, white pepper, brett, lemon juice, touch of funk even. Taste: medium sweetness and bitterness. Pretty wild en lemony with notes of grass, slight spiciness, some funk. Palate: medium bodied, oily texture and lively carbonation. Overall: best farmhouse ale I’ve had so far. Enjoyable and complex.\n",
      "Pours black with an awesome reddish head and develops after the pour is complete.  The nose is overpowering whiskey and mild oak and roasted malt.  The taste isn't very sweet, which in this case is unfortunate since its needed to cut the alcohol flavor.  As it is, oak and whiskey clearly dominate, while minor chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt do come through as well.  Long and heavy oak finish.  Full bodied and thick in texture.  All of the oak and whiskey didn't agree with me.  I though I would like this much more, but instead its a colossal disappointment.\n",
      "Bottle from Beers Of Europe.\n",
      "Pours a very dark mahogany colour with a fast dissipating beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, dry dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, coffee, cherries, brown bread and brown sugar. Taste is the same notes as the aroma and very full flavoured. Full bodied with a lovely thick chewy mouthfeel. Very moreish for the strength. One of my favourite bocks. Great beer. Delicious!\n",
      "75cl bottle split with SimonBlok and Richardvv. Courtesy of SimonBlok. Pours a hazy pale yellow colour with a rapidly receding white head. Aroma of citrus, peach, slight vanilla, wheat, yeast. Taste is moderate sweet, medium bitter with a moderate dry and sour finish. Notes of pale malt, wheat, floral, yeast, slight citrus. Texture is oily to watery, medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation.\n",

      "Sweet orange, heavy yeast, pomegranate, sugar, chalk & spice tastes.\n",
      "Bottle from trade. Pours black with very brief head. Deep bitter chocolate, tobacco, toasted grains, wee bit candi sugar. Some alcohol heat. Quite old school heavy hitter. Intense.\n",
      "Tap at new bohemia golden valley. Black with small off white head.  Roasty nose.  Taste is sweet, roast, chocolate,  milk sugar,  nice balance at the finish.  Nice.\n",
      "2018 edition.  Pours black with a medium tan head.  The aroma is an assault of vanilla, then chocolate, fudge, licorice, and mild roasted malt.  This one is sweet.  The flavor of vanilla is strong as expected, but it isn't overwhelming like it was in the nose.  Whiskey, and oak are distinct, chocolate comes through later on in the sip, there are traces of licorice, and some roasted malt.  A quick sharp aftertaste is vanilla with a touch of whiskey.  Its medium to full in body and has a smooth, creamy texture.  Despite a mild whiskey burn, this one isn't as intense as other Bourbon County offerings.  It much smoother and easier drinking.  All told, this is a wonderful beer.\n",
      "Like the flavor of the hops and the light Carmel background of the grain to balance the bitterness. Didn’t care for the flavor of what is believed to be rye.\n",
      "Bottle order from the lcbo. Thick syrupy sweet imperial with boozy bourbon hit. Oakiness, chocolate and coffee, and a little vanilla in the finish. Little sweeter than I would have expected. It's quite good, though it tough to compete with the hype.\n",
      "Bottle shred at tilt, bingoham shn. A jet black coloured pour with a halo of dark tan head. Aroma is sweet black malts, liquorice, brandy snap, Warming alcohol, peanut. Flavour is composed of thick chewy, black malts, meaty roast, liquorice, bacon, brown sugars, light tang. Palate is medium sweet, Sticky rounded, moderate carbonation.\n",
      "A kávé alkalmazásához egy barley wine esetében csak abban az esetben nem közeledek idegenkedve és fenntartásokkal, ha azt egy Goose Island kvalitású főzde teszi egy Bourbon County-hoz mérhető színvonallal megáldott keretbe ágyazva. A kávé karaktere nagy súllyal nehezedik ugyan a szerkezetre, olyannal, amely általában az \"imperial\" jelzővel megáldott főzetek sajátja, ha valami, ez a barley wine megfelelő alanyul szolgál egy előnyös kölcsönhatás előállításához. S valóban, mint ahogyan a kávészemek pörkölt hangulata szinte magától értetődő módon ivódik bele az aromák likőrös, marcipános, meggybefőttes jegyeibe, úgy forrnak egybe a csokoládés, tölgyfás, vaníliás, bourbon-ös elemek a pörkölt fekete ital vonalaival. Ebben az esetben tehát az ízek befogadhatatlanul sokszínű jellegéhez egy intenzív, mégis a kompozícióba kívánkozó karakter csatlakozik a kávé személyében, így téve megismételhetetlenül egyedivé az eleve speciális, önmagában sem mindennapi főzetet.\n",

      "Underappreciated beer here!  This pinkish purple elixr was maaaybe my favorite (probably second, of many) of an epic 4 day Oregon Bender.  Maple up front and center but somehow not overdone as it's cut by loads of tart jammy blueberry, ample roasted and slightly bitter coffee and even some lactose to make this \"mindfuck\" of a beer (as our bartender aptly called it) even more ridiculously awesome.\n",
      "Ło panie, to je dibre. Takie czekoladowe, słodkie, ale przyjemnie, trochękawowe i lekko wiśniowe. Przyjemne, gładkie pijalne. Polecal.\n",
      "Maybe the smoothest hoppy beer over 10% I've ever had...hoppy as all get out, a plethora of citrus and tropical fruits blended to near perfection.  Slightly candied but not too sweet or hot at all!\n",
      "Slightly hazy bright golden with a thick foamy sticky white head. Lovely nose that’s fruity and juicy and lightly resinous with pine and pineapple and citrus fruit. Smooth flavor that’s soft and wheaty and pale and lightly fluffy with a lovely tree fruity tropical juicy hop flavor featuring papaya and pineapple and mango and a touch of citrus and tangerine and a smooth lingering fresh hoppy leafy resinous finish. Really charming and great!\n",
      "Taste: Robust, complex, sweet, malty, cocoa, vanilla, coconut, some coffee beans, sticky boozy finish. Same with the nose. Black, opaque,  tan head with sticky lattice on the glass. Full to heavy body. A warming sipper.\n",

      "12oz can pours out black topped with a oreo cream oil. Nose sadly is sour infection roast malts chocolate and coconut. Taste is more of the infected sour tart chocolate coconut bourbon barrels.\n",
      "500 ml bottle shared by DCLawyer, thanks Jason! Clear golden orange, off-white head. Aromas of tequila and lime. Tastes of oak, tequila, floral, malt. Medium body. Messy.\n",
      "No me gustó, tiene muy buenos aromas pero al final me supo como si estuviera tomando una vil Victoria\n",
      "So, I picked this sake up at a asian food grocery store that I go to regularly. I have tried several different sake varieties, in Japan and in the United States, although I would not consider myself an expert by any means. The bottle was nice, the price was decent, and I was excited to try a \"plum\" flavor sake. Unfortunately, this sake is really bad. Do yourself a favor and don't try it. It's major notes on the palate are of cherry flavored cough syrup, so don't buy it unless you enjoy that kind of thing because that is basically what it tastes like. Super disappointed because I had high hopes for it.\n",

      "Always loved A spell but this Premier Cry tastes like vinegar. A spell make vinegar. Have they mixed up?. Awful\n",
      "Cask. Brewer's description: \"...clean...\" uh huh, it's so clean it's cleaned out. The smell is VERY slightly malty, the taste is MILDLY malty - and that's it. Not even the usual amount of filler malt that I always complain about. Doubtful that this brew has had any sort of hop waved in its direction either. Waste of money, time, taste buds. It's like drinking ghosts. Not even a beer for teenage trainee drinkers.\n",
      "Edit: finished the pint, is there any way to score it sub-zero? Awarded Winner, Most Pathetic Brew of the Year.\n",
      "0,5l Flasche. Sehr helles Gelb, heller Schaum. Dumpfer Limo-Getreide Duft. Oh mann ist das süss im Geschmack. Limo, nur Süssstoff. Hat das mal jemand vor dem Abfüllen verkostet?! Grässlich!\n",
      "absolutne obrzydlistwo. zapach przywodzi na mysl jakiś kosmetyk, smak równie obrzydliwy, oczywiście szalenie słodki. jako jedyny chyba radler dla mnie niepijalny, poszedł do zlewu.\n",
      "Pink color with the sweet fruit flavor of a wine cooler.  Way too much fruit, overpowers the beer.\n",
      "Mittelporige, kurzlebige Schaumkrone eines dunkelgelb bis leicht orangenen, trüben Lagers. Riecht minimal muffig nach klammer Wäsche. Stark rezenter, metallischer Antrunk, metallisch-wässriger Körper mit einer leicht malzig-herben Note, die in einem schalen Nachhall mündet. Enttäuschendes \"Jubiläumsbier\".\n",
      "500ml bottle. It is rather a soft drink nor a beer. Lemon and sweetness dominate very much, you can't feel beer at all. Bad for beer drinkers.\n",
      "Burk 330 ml från Systembolaget. Guldfärgad med skum som lägger sig på insidan av glaset. Maltig doft med inslag av vått gräs. Maltig smak med honung och apelsin.\n",
      "Tastes nice at first but flavour evaporates as it goes down, lacks body, nice colour and smell but nothing special at all, wouldn't choose it at the bar.\n",
      "Can share at We Brought Beer, Tooting.  Clear mid golden. Aroma of sweet fruit, bubblegum and soft fruit.  Not super sugary, like some Cream Ales I’ve had in the past, but sweet enough and little body.  Mineral finish.\n",
      "Found this at the local last night and thought I'd try a pint ... no taster just give me a pint barman!!\n",
      "First taste was of a slightly hoppy ale but with a bitter aftertaste ... but the more I drank of it the worse it got ... until I had to take it back as I honestly couldn't drink it ... I've spent years trying all sorts of ales but this is down_right awful (my wife said \"you should have seen the look on your face as you were drinking it\")\n",

Taste is smooth, vinous, tart, roasted notes, young grapes, it’s a perfect blend and very unusual, light and easy to drink, probably dangerous :)\n",
      "Clear golden with a thin head.\n",

      "W smaku sztos, kakao, mleczna czekolada, delikatnie kawa, wanilia, alkohol niewyczuwalny.\n",
      "Często mam tak przy piwach że aromat jest świetny, a w smaku jest przeciętniak. Tutaj było odwrotnie, niezły aromat i sztos w smaku, gęste, intensywny, naprawdę świetne piwo, a Browar York to był zdecydowanie czarny koń WFP.\n",
      "500-ml bottle from lincoln park food & liquor. gorgeous cascading head that fizzed away vigorously and almost completely, huge chocolate nose, boozy, huge chocolate / fudge, full body, decadent, the most and best chocolate ever.\n",
      "It pours clear, golden with a full white head. Head retention is excellent. It has a strong grapefruit citrus aroma. There is a bit of pine with bread in the background. It has a strong grapefruit flavor with some citrus elements. There are some light stone fruit notes in the background. There is also a low bready and biscuity quality as well. It has a medium body with strong bitterness. Overall, excellent IPA with strong grapefruit and a surprisingly stone fruit and biscuit quality that comes on strong through the finish.\n",
      "bitter, bread, high drinkability, smooth, clean crisp, fruity, salty, umami, nice white foam, good golden color,\n",

      "Sådan skal en IPA brygges.\n",
      "Godt humlet, men alligevel ikke overdrevet humlet.\n",
      "looks like raspberry juice. Smells like rose and Cabernet with apple. Lambic-like. Ultra dry. Sour and lots of apple and pear\n",
      "Excellent ipa. Good body and mouthfeel, good balance of bitterness, hops and sweetness.\n",
      "This was the first beir I drank in Germany and truly loved. The banana flavor is awesome and it's well balanced. This is the beir that helped me to start expanding my horizons when enjoying a beir.\n",
      "At Borefts 2019. Aroma of bourbon vanilla, chocolate, caramel fudge and malt. Taste has rich caramel fudge, cinnamon, vanilla, bourbon booze, chocolate and soft chili. All the flavors are strong, but very balanced. This is amazing.\n",
      "Замечательный марцен.Вкус изящный,немного медовый.Очень люблю октоберфестовские сорта,этот из лучших.Avra greek restaurant Bangkok\n",
      "Один из лучших на мой вкус нейпа,совершенно не горький,фруктовый.В Авре ресторане Бангкок\n",
      "Шикарное пиво.Если любите Хугарден,то это улучшенная крафтовая версия.Пил в Авра ресторан в Бангкоке.\n",
      "Pours deep coffee just a skeezix above black with a thick and persistent chocolate head. Aroma delivers roast coffee with some green coffee beans, roast malt, milk chocolate, nutty and subtle dark fruit notes. Flavor presents roast malt, quality coffee, chocolate, nutty and, yes, a little cherry on the back end, plus a charred side note. Texture offers good, smooth body and lively fizz. Enjoy any time of night - or day, because it's midnight somewhere on the globe.\n",
      "3grams carbs, 6.9% alcohol, gluten free?  The only downside is the price is about $12 per 6-pack here in Lexington KY.  Very delicious crisp cider that won't make you fat or give you diabetes plus it has a high alcohol content.  There is no aroma of \"rotting fruit\" as one reviewer describes.  If you are following the primal/paleo lifestyle (no gluten, low carbs) this is a godsend.\n",
      "I love a good porter beer. I recently was vacationing at the Grand Canyon and found pie hole on tap. I was instantly amazed with the taste of this beer. It is very smooth and you can independently taste the vanilla, coffee, chocolate with the hint of cherry. After having a couple at the lodge, I found they also sold them in the can at the general store inside Grand Canton national park so I picked up a few for my hotel room. The only bad thing...I am from Texas and it isn’t available here, so I am prepared to vacation more in Arizona just so I can have access to such a great beer!\n",

      "Dark amber with a fast dissipating head.\n",
      "Smell of nuts and sweet fruits. Taste of flowers, malt and a little soapy. Medium carbonation. Weak body.\n",
      "Tall can from grocery store. Smells fruity and well hopped, pours golden with ample head. A bit murky, but that could be stylistically appropriate. Thin and dry, with too little malt/sweetness to counter the hops. Found it too unpleasant to drink.\n",
      "Clear golden with a thin head.\n",
      "Strawy, hempy smell of hops. Bitter and dry, a bit too dry for my taste. High carbonation.\n",
      "Not my kind of beer.\n",
      "440ml can, but 4 days out of date.  Murky dark brown. Aroma of dark malt and metallic notes.  Dark sugars in the flavour with damp malt.  Considering it had only just gone out of date, this beer was in a bad way.\n",
      "From a can you get a surprisingly clear liquid (considering the name, heheh) with a big foamy pour. It has just a very slight haze but no way is this hazy. No real offensive IPA smells in this one. Taste is big bad IPA of course and possibly it has a bit of an aged feeling to it. Date code is CMB1 9198 2361, whatever that means. Yes, big bitter IPA bullshit, like any other of the thousand ubiquitous IPA out there. What else can be said? NOTHING. Oh well, so goes the tick. Not impressed.\n",
      "Clear golden with a thin head.\n",
      "Strawy, hoppy smell. Very metallic taste with a malty finish. Mainly rather watery. Low carbonation.\n",
      "Zlatnozuta boja, bijela pjena srednje debljine, srednje trajna. Metalna aroma, veoma blago, skoro neprimjetno, arome trave i meda. Slabe gorčine, duzeg gorkog finiša. Vodene teksture, jake karbonizacije.\n",
      "Do nebe volající hnus, který jsem koupil jen tak ze zvědavosti, když jsem na něho natrefil v čadském Tescu.\n",
      "Cask at The Crown, Watford in 2012. Always was a naff Beer. Amber with a ring of white head. Aroma of sulphur, eggs, malt and raisins. Minimal flavour, with some grainy and mineral notes.\n",
      "Cask at the Kings Tun (JDW), Kingston in 2015. On paper this sounded good; the reality less so (although ‘Marston’s’ was a pretty big indicator). Hazy copper with an offwhite head. Lightest of peaty aromas; more sulphurous and grainy. Boiled sweets and apples in the flavour.\n",
      "Many thanks for this beer to Beerhunter111. Sweet aroma with lemons and lime. Sweet flavour with lemons and lime.\n",
      "Foggy gold body and okay foam, rotting armpit or maybe rancid lemons on the nose. Flavour is vague sweet hops overlaid with bitterness on the aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden, but other than that this one is a miss.\n",
      "Yellow pour with zero head. Aroma is odd and medicinal. Has a weird flavor of unknown spices. Kind of tastes like a Band Aid smells. Strange numbness on the palate. Little to enjoy here. Bottle.\n",
      "Clear yellow body and bleach white foam, about what you'd expect. Smells of rotting socks found in the dumpster behind your house. Flavour is sweet lagery hops, vague hints of booze and a cloying tinny aftertaste. Kind of what you might expect from this beer, though the alcohol is reasonably well hidden.\n",
      "Barwa złot, klarowne. Cienka piana, bardzo szybko znika z kufla. Smak rzygowin, kwas, nieco słodu, generalnie odpycha. Posmak kwaśny. Bardzo słabe piwo, jeśli w ogóle można to nazwać piwem.\n",

      "7.3%. På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Spandert av BeerViking. Delt med ham & Rune. Svart. Mokkafarget filmskum. Aroma av sjokolade & bær. Bringebæra dominerer smaken. Tørr bæraktig avslutning.\n",
      "I don't think is that bad as everyone thinks, not the best beer on earth but not a bad taste and a really low price.\n",
      "Keykeg at GBBF Winter 2020 and 7.3%, black with a fine crema and a berry-tangy nose. Dark, dry and roasted, with a tart edge. Notes of ashy coffee, a light fruity sweetness, then more burnt ash.\n",
      "Can from Citysuper at home. Deep golden transparent pour with puffy white head. Aroma is strong biscuit malt and deep resin hop. Taste is similar. Earthy bitterness, with some dank tropical mango. Biscuit malt. Lightly fizzy palate with fine carbonation. Bitter bite on finish, some alcohol warmth. Might be SF connection, but this seems related to an amped up, very slightly tropical Anchor IPA. Not bad at all.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Svart. Lavt mokkafarget skum. Lakrisaroma. Smaken balansert. Sjokolade. Lakris. Røstet malt. Tørr avslutning. Kakao. Av de bedre.\n",
      "Shared pint can poured to snifters showing a cloudy, straw color, with a decent layer of soft white froth, and a tight array of spots & streaks as lacing. The nose was ripe & dank, with expressive pineapple, citrus, and pit fruit. Medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste was similar, adding complementary tartness & tanginess, soft creaminess, and appropriate, citrusy bitterness to match.\n",
      "Cask at GBBF Winter 2020, golden with vanilla and raspberry on the nose, then full bodied, sweet and strong, odd yet very drinkable.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Delt med Rune. Gusjegulbrun. God fersken/plommearoma. Smaken mango. Vanilje. Bra - men vel søt.\n",
      "Cask at GBBF Winter 2020, glowing brown with a lasting white head, 4.2%, fruity malty nose with hints of red fruit, sweet and herbal bitter, nice balance.\n",
      "På GBBF Winter 2020 i Birmingham. Spandert av BeerViking. Mørk gylden. Lett fruktaroma. Smaken tørket frukt. Litt sherrypreg. Tørr avslutning.\n",
      "Pale yellow color, fast dissapearing foamy white head. \n",
      "Sweet aroma, reminds me of corn, though it does not contain any. Taste is lightly malty, lightly bitter, light bodied with medium carbonation. Not bad for its price for hot summer days, but nothing really special going on here. \n",
      "\n",
      "One common trend I ca say about this brewer is sometimes, you’re not sure what you’re drinking. Is this one a brut, a sour, I would put it more in the malted wine category. Tastes close to a white wine, which is interesting.\n",
      "Shared 16.9 oz. bottle that was cellared a couple of years, poured to snifters showing a black/brown hue, with a presentable layer of brownish tan froth, and foamy spots & strands of lacing. The nose was roasted, malty, and freezer burn scent, with cocoa, dark caramel, slight dark fruit, and vanilla revealed upon warming. Medium+ bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar, sweet, with the \"back of the freezer\" vanilla ice cream character diminishing to a harmless level, somewhat hidden alcohol, and adding some roasted & earthy bitterness, but no noticeable coconut. Showed a little age, but tasty enough.\n",
      "Draft. A golden beer with a huge white head. The aroma has notes of straw, minirals, and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of straw, malt, and brewing cereal, leading to a bitter finish.\n",
      "(Bottle) Pale amber with huge thick white head. Grain aroma. Light body and fizzy. Watery, metallic, unpleasant. Pretty nasty.\n",
