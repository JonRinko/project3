0,Notch Kolsch,3.4,"Salem , Massachusetts                    ","Pours pale gold into a stange. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to coat surface. Caramel and hay aromas. Soft with hay, grass and sourdough upfront turning to lemon/lime (?!) in the medium length finish.",GDTRFB
1,Dogfish Head American Beauty Hazy Ripple IPA,3.3,"Milton, Delaware                         ","On Tap.  Classic hazy light golden straw color. Soft wheaty floral, tropical aromas and fa=lavors.  Flowery even.  Soft pillowy finish.  A littel allspice or clove at the end. A bit fancy and pretentious but pleasant and soft.",IndianaRed
2,Iowa 3rd Street Stout,3.6,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa                             ","12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Aromas of vanilla, caramel, malted barley, wet grass, forest floor, milk chocolate and dark-roast coffee. Pours deep chocolate brown with one finger of foamy chocolate head that dissipates rapidly. Opens crisp and acidic for its style with creamy sweet roast taking charge on the mid-palate and a long roasty and somewhat hoppy finish. Medium- to full-bodied with mild stickiness and astringency in the end, just a touch. Not bad! Nose is very appealing, flavor is a bit generic, but the price is great and it's very drinkable.",saltyseadog

4,Beck's,2.1,"Bremen, Bremen                           ","My old man's go to. Very important to get the imported variant rather than the domestically brewed stuff. Although, it's not really that great and I'd have a few choices over it at the price point. A bit bolder than the regular macro lager, but otherwise quite standard.",fellers
5,Gigantic Massive! - Cognac Barrel,4.2,"Portland, Oregon                           ","Bottle from Bine & Vine. Pours hazy ruddy brown with a slight beige head. Aroma of slight musty oak and brandy. Note: This should also be placed in Calvados barrels. There's medium dark fruit notes. Can't parse out malt. There is heat mixed in the aroma. Full bodied. Flavor is musty oak, brandy, red berries, roasty malt, brown sugar. Heat is detectable, but so subtle it has to be paid attention to - cause the overall flavors really obscure it. Not dry, but something, perhaps heat, tends to balance out the malt. This is excellent.",bhensonb
6,Kona Island Colada Cream Ale,3.8,"Kailua Kona, Hawaii                           ","Can smell the cream, pineapple and some coconut. Get mostly cream and some sweet pineapple. Decent.",Obfuscate
7,Heineken,1.3,"Zoeterwoude, Netherlands                      ",Another lame macro lager. Boring and watery. I don't know why people bother to import this into Australia when there are a billion beers like it already available.,fellers
8,Spring House Taang! ,3.7,"Conestoga, Pennsylvania                     ","16 oz. Aroma is Smarties, Tang, oranges, bready. Pours hazy golden with large-ish chunks of sediment floating around; has a one finger bone-white head with decent retention. Taste has a moderate pithy  bitterness, a light to moderate sweetness, with flavors of Tang and oranges, peel and pulp, vanilla. Not bad.",poisoneddwarf
9,Pipeworks Donut Soup,4.0,"Chicago, Illinois                         ","16 ounce can.  Pours black with a decent tan head.  Aroma of chocolate, malt, vanilla, and coconut.  Taste is chocolate, vanilla, coconut, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee.  Nice to sip on.",RobertDale
10,Maine Beer Zoe,4.1,"Freeport, Maine                            ","500 ml. bottled 10/29/2019. Slightly foggy, chestnut brew with a creamy film of foam. Interesting aroma of pineapple upside-down cake with touches of cocoa, grapefruit and orange. Flavor has bread, orange, grapefruit, toffee, white pepper, toasted walnut and a touch of coffee. Medium body has medium-high carbonation that's almost too much but remains smooth enough. Easy drinking balance that finishes nutty and dry.",nearbeer
11,Robinsons Helles Lager Bier,2.5,"Stockport, Greater Manchester               ","Keg @ Castle Hotel, Manchester.  Golden with a creamy head.  It's certainly styled well and is crisp with a fair carbonation.  This one is for lager lovers only though.",ManVsBeer
12,Kansas Avenue Ghostly Coyote,2.9,"Salford, Greater Manchester               ","Cask @ Abel Heywood, Manchester.  Blonde with a creamy head.  It's a very easy textured hoppy ale with some bitterness.",ManVsBeer
13,Bell's Light Hearted Ale,4.2,"Comstock, Michigan                         ","An excellent example of a style I really enjoy. Light, crisp with a nice hop profile.",Obfuscate
14,Torrside Autonomy,2.8,"New Mills, Derbyshire                       ","Cask @ Jack In The Box at Mackie Mayor, Manchester.  Copper-red with a small head.  Has a bittered crisp hoppiness, but not that flavoursome.",ManVsBeer
