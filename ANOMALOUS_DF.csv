0,Beamish Irish Stout,5.0,"Cork, Ireland","""il solito"" al pub che frequento di più era la Beamish. Una birra che non ti stanca mai, leggera di gradazione, dissetante, ne berresti litri!
Ottima stout Irlandese ""caffelattosa"", con schiuma spumosa (spillatura ad azoto).
Per il mio gusto, superiore alla ""sorella"" ben più famosa e diffusa.",flogisto
1,Simpler Times Pilsner,0.6,"Monrovia, California","Jesus this is bad. Not sure what discriminates this from their lager, taste very similar with harsh grainy notes, corn, acetaldehyde. Light bitterness.",PhillyBeer2112
2,Revolution Fistmas Ale,1.9,"Chicago, Illinois","HAHA, funny name and interesting can from chalet.  Once popped, this stuff smells like a pine tree, no lie, a real Christmas tree, heheh. Taste is spruce and pine needles. Yes, it really does make me think that it's Christmas. Color is slightly darker than pale. Lots of hops and very few if any spices, as in any other holiday brew that is spiced to death and I'm glad, I dislike those holiday spiced brews. Yes, more like an IPA and I bet IPA lovers will like this. Can't really find the orange peel, but I think I do pick up a little bit of ginger and heat in the finish. I don't like IPA but this is better than most holiday brews. So be it.",cheap
3,Samuel Adams Utopias,2.0,"Boston, Massachusetts","Mildly syrupy, but not overly sweet. Woody and raisiny, if that’s a real word. Not your “traditional beer” taste. Sold by the ounce at Boxelder in Miami. Very interesting to try, worth trying, but personally wouldn’t try it again, not my style.",tryeverything

8,Lost Abbey Red Poppy Ale,2.3,"San Marcos, California","Cocoa-colored with tan head that doesn't stick around.  Carbonation produces foamy head which lingers.  Vinous, lactic aroma.  Extremely sour to the point it's difficult to taste anything.  Very dry finish with vinous aftertaste.  Feel like I need to drink something between sips to rehydrate my mouth.  I want to like this given the other positive reviews, but I'm just not seeing it.  Overall: too sour, too little going on, and I'm not convinced the cherries or poppies are doing anything.",frozencemetery

white foam that dissolves quickly and leaves little residue
smells of hay, flowers—rose?

11,Paulaner Weissbier-Radler Alkoholfrei ,3.1,"Munich, Bavaria","Pours hazy amber with a thin white head. Aroma of sweet lemon juice.

13,Vox Populi Kettle Sour,0.7,"Montréal, Quebec","Colo amarillo pálido con una ligera neblina. Espuma desmesurada. Aroma a gaseosa y limón. Gusto a cerveza Pale Lager industrial de las baratas mezclada con gaseosa La Casera, notas de polvo y metálicas. Cuerpo acuoso.

23,Knee Deep Oopsie Dhazy,1.6,"Auburn, California","Orange can from chalet.  Not really a hazy IPA but rather clear. First taste is big bitter IPA, whew. Has a muted perfumy IPA nose. Lots of citrus on the tongue. Maybe I can find some hints of guava and passion fruit, but not much. Yes, lots of IPA bitterness, but good co2 for an IPA. Terribly on style, rude crude and nasty. Hey, IPA, I'm calling your name. I need to impeach this style, get it off ratebeer, heheheheh. Call in the witnesses; IPA is ubiquitous,the new cheap macro brew.",cheap

29,Figueroa Mountain Point Conception,1.6,"Buellton, California","Can from chalet.  Pour is clear and pale. Big white head. Smell is sharp floral IPA and so is the taste. Its terribly on style and it provides a kick. What else can be asked from one of a million ubiquitous, really effin straight up ass, on style  IPA? Go figger. Same as it ever was.

Orange hazy with a frothy head.
Smell of passion fruit, peach and grapefruit with a grainy, milky note, but also this funky rotten fruit note present in some beers of the bigger IPA family. In taste this funky fruit note is even stronger.

39,New Belgium Voodoo Ranger Starship IPA,1.4,"Fort Collins, Colorado","Tap at bowsers in monaca. I'm so tired of ubiquitous IPA and I'm especially tired of NB revamping the ranger by just slapping a new label on any ubiquitous IPA, quite rude. I'm done ticking these things they always taste the same, my immature taste buds cannot differentiate between these. Anyway, this is just another bitter IPA. Big stupid straight up ass insult to my lager loven taste buds. Whew, rubber chewing on inner tube long bitter finish as well. Just like any other terribly on style IPA, go figger.",cheap
40,Southern Tier Cinnamon Roll,1.5,"Lakewood, New York","Tap at bowsers, thot I did this one already. A darker brew. Smells like some kind of sweet cinnamon cookies. Taste is flat and bitter with too much of that holiday spice thing going on, comes across as quite rude on the palate. Not good, just too much spices. Seems more like a medicine. Difficult to finish. Good example of a poorly made holiday brew, whew.",cheap
41,Rhinegeist Pure Fury,1.7,"Cincinnati, Ohio",Tap at bowsers. Pale  and it has a mild perfume hop nose. Very bitter up front with lots with lots of green grapefruit rind in there.

43,Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale,1.2,"Chicago, Illinois","Pours headless, malty aroma and grassy spiced fruit finish. Have seen this in a mix pack with midway and other goose island beers, I like their other stuff but this would be a reason for me not to buy the selection pack, it’s very different and far from hoppy like Midway and their ipa.",MeadTrub23

Big thick head. Big bitter biting hops from the start, difficult and nastily on style, wheeeeew. Much more medicine than my lager lovin taste buds can handle. So big, so bad, so triple IPA. Thick and viscous on the palate as well as mouth coating like chewing on rude ass partially fermented pine needles ground up into green grapefruit rinds. One big ass kicking imperial experience.

54,Fagnes Quatres Ceréales,1.2,"Mariembourg, Belgium","Bière ambrée de 7,5 % abv, en format 75 cl avec bouchon de liège.
Mon exemplaire était juste à 4 ans après sa date.
Couleur ambré orangé, aux reflets rouquins, et à la clarté pure.
Bulles moyennes, en fontaine centrale, très nombreuses et bien vives.
Mousse blanc cassé, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de pommes cuites, caramel, cookie. Nez très pauvre.
1ère bouche fluide, sur un ensemble peu malté et au goût cerisé !!
Arrière-bouche avec une touche de guimauve.
2ème bouche fruitée, sucrée, très mal assemblée.
Arrière-bouche courte, sans personnalité.
Longueur sur un ensemble très quelconque de bière aux fruits rouges !!
Jambes à gros flocons, courtes.
Levure correcte.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau, il est parti moissonner d'autres céréales.
Finale banale.
CONCLUSION : cette bière est un paradoxe pur, puisqu'en utilisant
4 céréales au brassage, on trouve une bière fruitée et sucrée !!
L'âge ne l'a aucunement aidée, et la texture est très faible …

57,Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.5,"La Crosse, Wisconsin","24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/10/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Thin but not too watery finish. Zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nice clean pale malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. Not too overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example.",superspak

Deeply hazy straw yellow with a thick ice cream rocky head that leaves levees of thick lace. The aroma is pretty gross. Lots of cellar must, sea water, rotten grains., lemon, and hops.

Its odd, because; right up the street we have the Firestone farms which is right next to the Firestone tires proving ground, go figger, you'd think somebody round here would have used the name first instead of some jokesters from the happy go lucky C state. This thing has a pour which is a somewhat hazy brew but probably not as muddy as a NE IPA should be. Maybe its all settled in the bottom of the can, heheh. Sharp IPA nose. Taste is what else? Its simply perfumy IPA all the way, I made a rhyme, gimmie a dime. At least it doesn't smell like BO or diesel. There, you have it; some kinda of IPA which is right in yer face, terribly on style.

Yes, somebody accidentally left the peels on these green unripened citrus fruits. Nice and hazy on pale is the eye. In the middle it starts to get unruly and sweet as well as perfumy, a little cloying. Yes, coconut and pineapple does not help here.  Yes, this is what seems to be an aged IPA turned into a fruity.

86,Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5.0,"Reno, Nevada","As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Creamy vanilla colored head. Make no mistake, this is another one of those awful spiced holiday brews, too much spice. Its quite rude but at least it is spiced to cover all its imperfections, just like the rest. You may simply  call it a Christmas  brew, it taste just like the rest; an insult to Christmas.  When are these beer companies going to jump off their high horse and try brewing some plain old good beer? Just asking. Yes, this is simply some way over the top ale, that has way too much spices in it. Get with it DFH, get back to your roots and quit chasing the money making niche of craft beer. You need to make just 12 really good beers. FORGETTAHBOUT all that happy bullshit. Get with it I say. Maybe you better go find some chemical analysis of some mummy's tomb and recreate the beer you think you found in the bottom of the sarcophagus.

112,Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5.0,"Boortmeerbeek, Belgium","Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.  Overall, this is not enjoyable to drink.  It's harsh, astringent, very bitter, and tastes like eating garden weeds.  What an unfortunate first impression with this beer brand.",DarkElf

127,Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,"Stockport, Greater Manchester","Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back.

158,Natural Light,3.7,"St. Louis, Missouri","This beer has always gotten an undeserved bad rap mostly because it's price lends itself to first time drinkers who abuse it and themselves. Early marketing proclaimed it as the ""beer with the taste for food"". And that is how I discovered it with a friend serving it along with hot wings.  Thirty-five years later it is still a beer you will most frequently find in my fridge. To me it is better than and certainly no worse than Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light. Beers that my neighbors and friends stock their fridges with. You won't see flashy ads on TV for Natty light, but if you think that extra couple of dollars you have to pay for those previously mentioned brands is because of better taste/quality, you would be mistaken. In fact, I did a blind taste test with a group of neighbors a couple of summers ago and Natty Light won with 2 out of 3 of them. Hardly ""scientific"", but evidence that perception/reputation is more powerful than reality.

There are a number of more expensive beers that I also enjoy very much (Sam Adams Summer Ale, Terrapin Hopsecutioner, Harp to name but a few), but you are far more likely to find Natural Light in my fridge on a given weekend and I make no apologies at all for it. Especially not to someone holding a Miller Lite.",BubbleChamp43

La question pour celle-ci est de savoir précisément si c'est une double ..
Mon exemplaire était à 16 mois avant sa date.
Couleur roux sombre à l'opacité moyenne, et clarté nette.
Bulles fines, en fontaine centrale, à montée lente.
Mousse beige, à fins flocons, stable à 1 mm.
Arômes de compote de prune, cassonade, pointe de cannelle.
1ère bouche fluide, à l'entame très modérée, caramélisée.
Arrière-bouche à la définition très vague, courte.
2ème bouche avec un côté guimauve et pantouflard.
Arrière-bouche faible, indéterminée, beaucoup trop caramélisée.
Longueur qui n'améliore rien dans la définition.
Jambes huileuses, longues.
Levure basique.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau abv, il laisse faire les choses trannnnquille ...
Finale paresseuse.
CONCLUSION : cette brune n'était donc pas une double, c'est assez vexant !

182,Propolis Prunus (11/13) ,5.0,"Port Townsend, Washington","Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.

The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.

Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche !

Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.

A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur.

Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.

En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans.

Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Overall this is a pretty good NA lager. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Flavorful and not too watery. Nice clean pils malt/grain showcase, with great noble hop presence/balance for the style. Zero residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Far from the best NA beer I've had, but there are minimal noticeable cardboard off flavors than some other ones.",superspak

313,Rogue Farms Marionberry Braggot,5.0,"Newport, Oregon","Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.

The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.

Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.

Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Smells of caramel malt, leather, tobacco, very fruity of the dark pitted kind, notes of sherry and more than a hint of fruity tartness. Oxidation is obvious.

Yep, the oxidation took a turn to the tart side; damn cork. Still has lots of sherry notes and leather, light sweetness, but really, it resembles a wine more than a beer at this point. Strong too, lots of heat in the swallow.

428,Firestone Walker Napa Parabola,2.3,"Paso Robles, California","Bottle (2019 vintage). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately malty (chocolate cookie, caramel, roasted grain), with notes of soy sauce, plastic bags, pine sap, and alcohol. Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Extremely disappointing. The aroma is just plain off...soy saucy and plastic-like. Where is the red wine character that I was hoping for (and persuaded to purchase because of)? Alas, it is not evident in this sample. Probably less of the fault of the base beer and just a failure of the barrel to yield its good qualities, instead imparting these icky off notes. Not enjoyable in the mouth either; wayyy too syrupy sweet with little else but harsh alcohol as an attempt to balance...I'd hesitate to even call it drinkable, but it's certainly not enjoyable. An unexpected drain pour...I really thought this was going to be mid/high 3s sort of beer.",Ernest

Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  

I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).

Pretty decent aroma to it, some sweet, almost over ripe banana and cloves with some subtle hints of pineapples and dried fruit as well. 

Malt forward with a heavily sweet almost, syrupy body to it with solid fruit flavors present, some dried stone fruits, apricots, apples and cherries with some faint hints of whiskey and vanilla notes. Heavy bodied, thick, full bodied and potent like a barley wine with a sweet toffee and butterscotch malt flavor. 

Finish is strong, boozy and sweet but with a slightly woody coniferous hop note that increases in bitterness as it warms, though due to the heavy bodied sweetness it sticks to the background, but does add a bit of balance to the beer to keep it from being completely over sweet. Back-end has some strong aromatic Belgian esters with notes of banana chips, cloves, black pepper, musty coriander and pineapple that hang out on the palate along with some warming boozy ethyl volatiles that linger with the sweetness on the aftertaste.",WortStein17

It's tasty cold and is affordable. Goes down smooth and tastes fine with food. We aren't from your country so some of your beers taste pretty piss poor to us as well. Just throwing that out there. My beer doesn't need to feel like I just ate an entire meal after drinking one. 

This beer is great cold after mowing the lawn or a hard day at work. This is naturally a light beer anything lighter and you might float away.

478,O'Shea's Traditional Irish Stout,1.0,"Atherstone, Warwickshire","Review: 50cl brown bottle of O’Shea’s Irish Stout: 4.5% vol.

Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!

Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” 

On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. 

Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.

The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.

On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.

In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. 

Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.

Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!

It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. 
Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….",Drinking_77

Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, slightly unclean.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

Aroma of grass, hay, light metal, some funk and cardboardie malt and a dash of peppery hops on the end.

Aftertaste is very deep and bitter - mainly from the grassy malts and the lager yeast - these are very strong and don't go away at all. Overall, a fairly strong pilsener that is very typical for an American beer, just sadly, from Macro-producers; This doesn't taste like a craft beer at all - it could be from SABMiller or In-Bev and you wouldn't even know at all.

The inspirational beer in question combined a mild fruit flavor with a timid spice that kicked it up a bit while still keeping it's yeasty roots. 

this beer doesn't understand subtlety. It just throws in a mass amount of fruit flavoring in the beer and drowns out any actual ""beer"" flavor.

I had seen favorable reviews of this beer, and was looking forward to trying it. Sadly, it’s not what I expected. Upon deeper examination, it might be one of the hops that doesn’t work for me. I’ve never liked Mozaic. 

The beer pours a straw to golden color, with a thin white head. The color is a little hazy. But I’m a homebrewer, so a little haze doesn’t bother me (we are talking about an ale, right?). 

The aroma is where I first notice the Mozaic hops. Very dank, and not pleasant at all. Like a cat’s litter box. 

Taste isn’t any better. Not bad, if I drink it fast enough. If I try to enjoy it, the whole litter box sensation comes back and I’m like, “Why do I keep doing this to myself?”

I once had a six pack of another ale featuring Mozaic hops. And I found that if I forgot about it in the basement for about six months, the dank had faded and I was left with something drinkable. I think I’ll do the same with the remainders from this sample pack.

1045,Delirium Red,5.0,"Melle, Belgium","Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Delirium Red is a Belgian ale with cherry and elderberries crafted by Brouwerij Huyghe.

The fragrance of elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is purple that pours a low pinkish white head. When held up to light, the beer glows maroon and reveals sediment. The alcohol content is 8%.

Elderberries are juicy and textures the mouthfeel. Cherries compliments the elderberries while moderately tarting the complexion. Belgian yeast softens the body and draws out the figs used. Biscuit malt blends and flavors the yeasty profile. Plums are easily distinguished during the finish as an almond touch fluoresces the finish. Black licorice spices the take and bitters the comprehension.

Delirium Red is an enticing Belgian ale. The elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt, and figs make this Belgian a one of a kind. This is a sweet beer. However, the Belgian yeast and almonds tones it down, yet the elderberries and cherries still perpetuate. The plum and almond finish is my favorite aspect to this beer. I loved drinking this libation and enraptured by its complexity. I highly recommend trying it. Cold, you will face the sweetness head on. In my opinion, serving it between cold and room temperature is optimal. Be careful as you pour to leave behind sediment.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

I had no idea that they were now producing it in the US and had completely changed the formula. There's some quality accessible US-made ale out there, like Bass ale, but this tasteless, bitter stuff that's in front of me right now is a failure on every corner. And a shame, too.

This is a huge problem for this category that is not hard to change but would make a huge difference. If you're listening, please don't skimp on using nitro to save on costs. I understand the business aspect but the cost to reputation is much higher. Though IPAs are all the rage now, stouts may later become a trend just as big. And for good reason. But that reason for becoming a stout fan is the thick creamy smooth and very aromatic flavor and smell of a well-aged barrel nitro imperial russian stout.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (grain, husks), lightly hoppy (herbs), with light notes of rotting vegetables (yellow squash, etc.), concrete, dirty dishrag, bubble gum, alcohol, apple juice.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, very unclean.

Medium to full body, syrupy/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The aroma is fairly meek, and composed almost entirely of off notes...if it was only stronger, it might score a 1 for aroma. Very dirty aftertaste as well, unsurprisingly. Honestly the only nice thing about it is the lasting head...everything else is just plain repulsive.",Ernest

Smells more like a salsa than anything else.  If it was called salsa beer then I would have been ready for that.  After reading the can I then discovered that this Clamato, is that clam and tomato? yuck!  Oh and picante is in it.  There is where the salsa smell is from.

1228,Big Drop Pale Ale,0.8,"Maidenhead, Berkshire","18-07-2019; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bière, as part of their February 2019 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are alright. Golden yellow colour, clear beer and very rough white head. Foam retention is almost non-existent. It looks a bit watery. It also ain't bubbling a lot. 
The aroma of the beer is soo-soo. Some simple rough malts that are a bit bready and some dry hop aromas. Grassy, piney and a bit zesty and fruity. But, not too strong. It all is a bit like a malt lemonade with some hop aromas dropped into it. It misses some of the soul of a beer.
The taste of the beer is okay. Bitter hops, sweet malts. Thats it. A bit rough and definitely simple. Not to unbalanced. But I expected a bit more. 
The palate of the beer is weak. Thin texture, light body and light carbonation. The finish is watery and short. It has some malts and some bitter hops. All in all, there are some essences of a Pale Ale in this beer. But, it misses soul, balance and yeast and alcohol. When do people start to realise beer just can't be made without alcohol. The yeast and alcohol are important parts of the aroma bouquet of a beer. It is the most important aspect of many beers.

1240,Hacker-Pschorr Sternweisse,1.6,"Munich, Bavaria","Die Biere von Hacker-Pschorr werden bereits seit 1998 bei Paulaner produziert.
Hab ich in den letzten 4 Jahren mehrfach verkostet und war das schlechteste Weissbier, das ich jemals verkostet habe (und ich habe über 100 bewertet). Hab ich noch nie erlebt, aber meine Körperchemie war nicht mit diesem Bier kompatibel. Konnte es einfach nicht glauben. Bei 4 von 6 Verkostungen waren ein tauber Mund (selbst die Lippen) und ein rauer Hals die Folge. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich mich gerade vergiftet habe. Irre. Ich kann es nicht erklären, da dies nur bei diesem Bier jemals der Fall war.
Bei der aktuellen Verkostung (Sommer 2019) passierte dies nicht und ich erlaube mir deshalb eine möglichst objektive (wenn auch nicht positive) Bewertung. 
Sehr viel Hefe, die da durchs Glas wabert. Find ich gut. Süß, malziger Geruch, nicht sehr lecker. Auch geschmacklich ist dies vorherrschend. Nicht sehr süffig. Wird ab dem Mittelteil dann sogar gallig / bitter, sehr unangenehm trocken, kratzig und dumpf. Bäh. Dass das harte Münchner Wasser in Verbindung mit viel Hopfen ein ""kratziges"" Mundgefühl erzeugt, ist ein Problem, dass seit Jahrhunderten bekannt ist - und das andere Brauereien aus der ""Hauptstadt mit Herz"" trotzdem irgendwie besser gebacken bekommen. Schade, dass das normale dunkle Weizen von Hacker-Pschorr inzwischen offenbar eingestellt wurde und es als Alternative nur noch die Sternweisse gibt.

1287,Rogue Kulture Clash,5.0,"Newport, Oregon","Acquired at Smart Time Food for $15.99, Kulture Clash is an Imperial Blonde Ale blended with kombucha tea crafted in collaboration between Brew Dr. Kombucha and Rogue Ales.

The aroma of kombucha, pear, lemon, and herbal notes are sensed as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.9%.

The kombucha tea is watery and makes the beer easy to drink. The tea aspect gives a domineering pear sensation. Cherries slightly tarts the complexion along with sweetening the tone. Ginger spices the take and lingers into the dry finish. Clove illuminates the pear timbre. Lemon compliments the pear and cherry flavors. Wheat fairly textures the mouthfeel.

Kulture Clash is an amazing Imperial Blonde blended with kombucha tea. The kombucha used delivers an impeccable experience despite this beer coming across as a kombucha instead of a beer. The cherry and ginger are a beautiful compliment to the lemon and pear. As a final product, I think it is an outstanding. This is exciting to drink that will leave an impression upon you.

1298,Spaten Münchner Hell / München / Premium,5.0,"Munich, Bavaria","In Bavaria they like to call a spade a spade. Especially if you’re  a beer, which they also like to call a Spade. Literally. 
As has been well documented beer has experienced a real renaissance in recent years, especially amongst the New wave craft brewery’s who really ate taking beer ‘to the limit and beyond’. It is nice therefore to remind ourselves once in a while that some people have been doing this for centuries. German Monks mainly.
 Spartan is one of Bavaria’s core beers bound by their purity laws. This makes it so excellent. A clear golden pour, crisp refreshing and date that slips down so smoothly. And a finish that plays your spine like a xylophone! Delicious 
Prost!

But also, it's usually nothing more than a sip and ""oh, that's neat"" before you want to move on. Can you drink a pint of one of those weird sweet flavored beers? Fuck no. Now on to the current rating. The Margarita Gose falls into their concoction category. So it is one of those ""oh, it's neat, tastes like a margarita, now back to beer"" reactions? Hell no it isn't. This is some awful shit right here. Sour with weird lime flavors, strange bitterness, vomit-esque finish. Two sips. Then shared two sips with others, who equally hated it. Then a third sip to confirm what I was tasting. Then down the drain. Guess what - I'll take the blame for wasting $15 on a 4-pack from a brewery known for making stupid fucking beers.

The description on the can says it's balanced with malt, and oh boy is it ever... too much so in my opinion. I'm not even a big hops guy, I enjoy a mild amount but the Fat Tug just has too much hops at first followed by too strong of a malt aftertaste. I think it would be better for me personally if it committed more to a hoppy taste, which is what myself and others are probably expecting from an IPA. For people who love a combination of both at the same time though, this might do it for you.",CiderMuse30

1470,Parallel 49 Horns Out,1.3,"Vancouver, British Columbia",Pale yellow but so full of butter on the nose that we had to send it back.  Totally gross.,Oakes
1471,Shock Top Twisted Pretzel Wheat,5.0,"St. Louis, Missouri",Delicious and easy drinking this beer was innovative and downright amazing. It truly felt like a was drinking a pretzel and it satisfies the sweet and savory tastes like no other. Nothing beat this tasty beer! Unfortunately I think shocktop failed in removing this from shelves and all they really needed was to promote it a little more!,TasteTeam32
1472,Alaskan Hopothermia Double IPA,1.2,"Juneau, Alaska","Drank right from the bottle, looks like its clear pale ale. Volatile aromatic first taste bud impressions.  Yes, big and bitter and typical IPA bullshit. Yes, big bitter banging bungalow blasting bastardized bowling ball backdoor bandit badger baked buggerring beached whale. BTW, this is just IPA, not really double or impy IPA. Just saying. There you have it!",cheap
1473,Miller Genuine Draft (MGD),3.6,"Milwaukee                       , Wisconsin","Very similar to corona and Heineken. None of the nasty chemical taste of Budweiser products or Miller Lite or Coors, strange as it may sound. Easy refreshing summer beer.",HopsLees38
1474,Greene King Heritage Suffolk Pale Ale,5.0,"Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk","Pint Bottle from Tesco's. Bottled conditioned, nice bit of sediment at the bottom. Lovely head on it. 
It's really flavoursome, crisp and very refreshing. Spicy, hoppy. Sweet vanilla nougat after taste. I like it alot.
Nice label on the back telling about the rediscovered malt. I really enjoyed drinking it",topherwalk
1475,Hatherwood The Ginger Grizzly ,0.7," Wimbledon, Greater London","I got a £5 voucher for complaining to Lidl. They admittedly said on this occasion there was a fault. However, the like other people here. It now tastes like a larger or pale ale. It's horrific and was the only one I really liked.",PilsnerLees31
1476,Aldi Brasserie 1897,4.5,"Atherstone, Warwickshire","10/10 if you are a student... £3.50 for 4 @ 5%, or 12 cans for £8!! Sorted mate.",jaack

1479,Lagunitas Newcastle Brown Ale (US version),0.5,"Petaluma, California","They took my go to beer and ruined it.  I have been running around to supermarkets and grabbing 12 packs before they disappear from the shelves.  I sent a sample of the ""new"" Newcastle to a lab for analysis and the report came back: ""your horse has diabetes.""  If I could give this a negative score I would. What a travesty.",BreweryStave35

1481,Wicked Weed Ferme de Chien ,1.1,"Asheville, North Carolina","14/IV/19 - sample @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival (Leuven), BB: n/a - (2019-539) 

Clear pale bright red beer, small creamy light pink head, little stable, non adhesive. Aroma: very funky, dirty, lots of sulphur, chemical, acetone, this is not good, not good at all… MF: lively carbon, medium body. Taste: dirty start, unclean acidity, weird, some cow stable, pretty acidic. Aftertaste: weird, dry, some tannins, lemon juice, very acidic, vinegar, dirty sour finish. Don’t like this one at all!

1482,Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can),0.8,"Preston, Lancashire","Can, Amber color with plenty of head and carbonation. Notes are so lacking and thin for the style. Some moldy bread, water, grain, rust and cream. Light to medium bodied. One and done on this beer for the rest of my life. Actually I would sip this one if the world was coming to an end in the very near future",PhillyCraft
1483,De Dolle Arabier,2.0,"Diksmuide, Belgium","Geel oranje bier met overdreven witte schuimkraag. Gist, hoppig met droge en heel bittere afdronk.",FrothyTickers24
1484,Weihenstephaner Original Alkoholfrei,3.9,"Freising, Bavaria","Clear golden with a nice head. 
Grainy smell. Malty taste with hop notes. Medium carbonation. Hoppy aftertaste.
So far my favourite low alcohol normal beer. And probably the one with the least energy: 14kcal/100ml.",ophone
